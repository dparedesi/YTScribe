DO NOT WRITE python scripts for this task.
Process the full `list-of-videos.csv` file by reading each row, extracting the video ID from the `url` column (the part after `v=` in YouTube URLs), checking if `transcript_downloaded` equals "success" and `summary_done` is empty/not set. Then select 10 random videos meeting these criteria: read the full corresponding transcript file (not only key parts of it) from `outputs/{video_id}.md` (skipping the YAML frontmatter between the `---` markers to get only the transcript text), generate a comprehensive 450-550 word summary -in one continuous long paragraph- of the full transcript content, extract up to 5 relevant keywords as a comma-separated list, add two new fields to the YAML frontmatter of the same `outputs/{video_id}.md` file (add `summary:` with your generated summary text and `keywords:` with the comma-separated list of keywords), then update only the `summary_done` column in the CSV to "yes" for that video, and stop after processing exactly 10 videos to avoid reprocessing the same transcripts on future runs.
DO NOT WRITE python scripts for this task. I want you to do it manually one video at the time.
Hard-constrain: meet the word count number of 450 to 550 in a continuous long paragraph
