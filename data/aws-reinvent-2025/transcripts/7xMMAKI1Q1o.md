summary: "Alexis Bateman (AWS Sustainability Tech Lead), Eric Etz (Director of Technology Sustainability, Salesforce), and Rao Charahala (Senior Program Manager, Adobe) discuss how their organizations are enabling sustainability initiatives using the AWS Customer Carbon Footprint Tool (CCFT). Alexis outlines AWS's sustainability goals (Net Zero by 2040, Water Positive by 2030) and the shared responsibility model. She highlights the evolution of CCFT, including the 2024 releases of Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) and Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE) data, and the recent addition of Scope 3 emissions reporting, which provides a complete view of a customer's carbon footprint (Scopes 1, 2, and 3).\n\nEric discusses Salesforce's strategy, which includes being Net Zero since 2021 (for Scope 1 and 2), utilizing their \"Net Zero Cloud\" product for management, and focusing on \"nature positive\" initiatives. He emphasizes the importance of data transparency from AWS for accurate reporting (e.g., CDP, 10-K filings) and forecasting. He also mentions right-sizing infrastructure (switching to Graviton, S3 Intelligent-Tiering) as a key operational lever.\n\nRao presents Adobe's three pillars of sustainability: Product (optimizing digital workflows like Acrobat/Sign), Operational (energy-efficient data centers), and Collaborative (advocacy). Adobe aims for Net Zero by 2050, with interim 2030 targets to reduce operational and supply chain emissions. He notes that AWS CCFT data is crucial for enhancing the precision of their Scope 3 reporting, moving from spend-based estimates to more accurate granular data.\n\nThe session concludes with a discussion on Generative AI's \"double edge\"—it increases energy/water consumption but also accelerates innovation in sustainability solutions (e.g., better grid modeling). Both partners express a desire for even more granular, real-time data and API access from AWS to drill down into product-level carbon footprints."\nkeywords: Sustainability, AWS Customer Carbon Footprint Tool, Scope 3 Emissions, Net Zero, Salesforce, Adobe, Shared Responsibility Model, Generative AI, GreenOps, Cloud FinOps\n---

I think we are finally ready to get started. First off, thanks everyone for joining the session today. I know you guys got a lot of choices to pick from, so we're really happy for you to join us here to talk about sustainability. So before we dive right in, wanted to just get a quick kind of pull on the, the audience who here works in sustainability? Does anyone work in sustainability? Touch sustainably data? OK, we got a few, uh, how about operations? Operations. We got some software development engineers in here, OK. Got a couple of those. How about FinOps? OK. Also this blinding light, so I, I see about two hands out there. OK. All right, great. Well, hopefully, uh, this talk will kind of touch on all of those dimensions and have something a little bit interesting for our, our builders out there, our fin ops, our operations, and of course, hopefully you all walk away here wanting to get more into sustainability or at least, uh, thinking more about it. Um, last question before we kind of dive right in. Who knows what the customer carbon footprint tool is? Oh, we got. We got? Alright, 3. All right. By the end of this talk, you will all know what the customer carbon footprint tool is and hopefully you will all go there and check it out and see what it is and, and what information it can and can provide you. All right, let's jump here. All right, so just, uh, to recap, you are in session 332, uh, in, in the session we're, I'm joined by, um, some colleagues in Adobe and Salesforce to talk about how, uh, they're enabling their sustainability initiatives using the customer carbon footprint tool. My name is Alexis Bateman. I am at AWS and I lead our sustainability tech team. Uh, we are, we enable all of our sustainability. Objectives at AWS, whether that be on our net zero carbon objectives, our water positive, our renewable energy goals, um, we are sort of the backbone, um, of those, of those products and initiatives and then today I am joined by Eric from Salesforce who's a, a director of technology sustainability, and Rao from Adobe who's our, who's in, uh, senior program manager for Cloud Fin Ops. Uh, thanks both for joining me today to talk about. Um, how you've leveraged CCFT to meet some of your goals. So, uh, we're gonna get right in. Uh, our agenda is pretty streamlined. First we're gonna talk about AWS sustainability. What are some of the goals that we have, um, and then of course how you actually can get insights and visibility into some of those goals through the customer carbon footprint tool which is available in, in the AWS billing console. Uh, then I'll turn it over to Eric to talk about Salesforce sustainability goals, um, what they're doing, and then, of course, how we've partnered, um, on some of those sustainability objectives and some of the reporting and insights that we provide to enable them, and then we will then, uh, pass it off to, uh, Rao to talk about, um, a similar set of, um, initiatives in Adobe and how they're, uh, driving these initiatives. Lives together, uh, with us, and then we, we have a few, um, targeted Q&A. I've had some, some conversations while I've been here in the short time and reinvent and we kind of curated a few questions that we're gonna talk about which are, you know, how is it, uh, some topic areas around generity AI and sustainability and so we'll end with that, um, and so that's our session for today. So we're gonna dive right in. So AWS, um, has sustainably at the core of a lot of our, uh, operations and how we provide services, uh, to you and to our builders and partners. Uh, we are, um, a climate pledge signatory which is Amazon's pan Amazon, uh. Climate pledge this is to be net zero carbon, uh, by 2040. So, uh, Amazon co-founded this, uh, together with global optimism, and we are, uh, uh, one of the signatories to the climate pledge and of course abide by that same set of objectives. But how do we actually operationalize that at AWS? We have a few different pillars that we, uh, work towards. Some of them are, are carbon-free energy, so how we actually supply our data centers with power, what sources of, uh, energy we, we use to actually power those across solar, wind, nuclear, uh, achieving, striving to achieve renewable, renewable and carbon-free energy goals. Um, also operating the most efficient, um, as we can in our, in our operations of our data centers. We also have circularity at the heart of a lot of how we build things. So whether that be looking at our critical raw materials, uh, critical rare earth materials, how we take those back, as well as circularity initiatives, um, for our components, uh, so just a quick, uh, factoid that in. Uh, last year we had over 23.5 million components recycle, uh, recycled or sold, um, on the secondary market, uh, since 2022, 2023, excuse me, uh, we also have a water positive objective, so let me just spell that out. Uh, so we are seeking to be water positive by 20, uh, 2030, and we're about 53% of that the way there. What does water positivity mean? It actually means that we're, uh, giving or replacing more water than we use in our operations of our data centers. So these are sort of like the three pillars that we, uh, uh, are driving towards in AWS sustainability and we partner across our entire company to achieve these objectives. But of course, um, so what does this look like at scale so we're, you know, seeking to provide a sustainable infrastructure at scale across 120 availability zones, uh, over. 245 countries and territories as well as, uh, over 38 geographic, uh, regions, uh, we've also looked at some studies, uh, that compare that we actually operate more efficiently, about 4.1 times more efficient than on-premise, um, so we are actually kind of providing that efficiency for our customers that are coming, coming to the cloud, but. We know we can't do sustainability in isolation, uh, so that's why, of course, today I'm joined by, by some of our, some of, some, some of our customers to tell their story as well. So sustainability is a shared responsibility. We as AWS, we had just talked about some of our goals across, uh, carbon free energy across water positivity. So we, you know, as the, the, the infrastructure that are providing these cloud services, we can, you know, support how we're building our servers and the components. We put them, uh, how we're cooling them, what water, where the water is coming from, how we handle our waste, what energy we're pro we procure, so we as AWS can control those and provide those to our customers. But we also have the customer partnership where, uh, customers like yourself are leveraging our services, uh, and so this would be where we need to actually support our customers on how they use AWS. So either that could be through the services we offer, that can be through the. Reporting and insights they're able to use to make decision making and so this is something we call the shared shared responsibility model for sustainability. um, so if you're familiar with the well ar well architecture pillar, um, this is one of the fundamentals of the sustainability, uh, uh, pillars in the well architected so you can, you know, read a little bit more about it, but fundamentally this is sort of the, the relationship that we share between AWS and our, our customers as well. So, you know, with that in mind, uh, we as sustainability really needed to kind of understand and meet our customers where they were at as we were, you know, understanding how we were deli what we were delivering, excuse me, what goals we're taking, what kind of transparency, what kind of visibility they needed to actually meet some of their sustainability objectives because, you know, again, not just the partnership model, but of course our customers are running directly on AWS so we are a portion of their footprint. So how do we, how do we do, uh, how do we start. To build some of that relationship, uh, you know, it's been a longer term initiative, but one of the key initiatives was launching a carbon footprint tool in 2022. So our carbon footprint tool, and I'll show you a little bit more later what that looks like, and of course kind of where you can learn a little bit more about it, but this, the customer carbon footprint tools actually shows our customer what portion of, uh, the AWS's emissions they're responsible based on their usage. So you log into the billing console, you're able to see that allocated. Um, portion, and I'll talk about a little bit about how we built that and we provide that to our customers, um, but what we learned along the way was we weren't listening close enough to our customers. We needed to know really what, you know, what was blocking them from making some of their, you know, progress on their initiatives, uh, how we could listen better, and so in 2024, excuse me, I built that, uh, oh no, excuse me, um, we built it, we kind of opened up customer survey to some of our, uh, biggest, our most vocal. Our most sustainability progressive customers to to really gather them together to get feedback um and so through this mechanism we're able to say hey you know what can we be doing better and and a lot of what we heard in the beginning was we need more transparency from AWS we need to, we know, we need to know, you know, how, uh, you know, our footprint looks running on AWS we need to know uh more visibility about your operations and so we've done a couple of things in response to that feedback, one of which was. Uh, releasing our power usage effectiveness, uh, ratings in 2024 across our regions. And so, uh, that actually provides visibility into how we're actually using power on site in our data centers. Um, we also released our water usage effectiveness earlier this year. So it's similar to power this is also looking at how, uh, efficient we are in water, uh, usage in our data centers to cool things down and so you're able to look at that at a regional level. And then, and in 2025, uh, along with, uh, along with some of the what we heard was to kind of level up our customer carbon footprint tool. Uh, customers wanted to know how we calculated those numbers. Could you tell us the methodology? Uh, is this third party verified? So we released a verified methodology to say this is actually how we're computing these numbers, and then we've had a third party say that this is, this is up to speed. And so we did that earlier this year, uh, along with, uh, better functionality and, and. To export so customers could get their their allocated portion more easily. Uh, we also, I'm sorry for the shorthand, also released location-based emissions, which is a different type of methodology. So we have both our market-based emissions which accounts for some of our, uh, energy attributes and other credits that we use in our total footprint, and then we have the location base which is essentially the grid, and this is our, our scope to reporting. And then just recently, just about a month ago, we released, uh, something called. Scope 3 emissions. I'll talk more about what that looks like across scopes, but we're sort of like it now rounds out the complete pie of AWS's footprint. So we have all scope 1, scope 2, and scope 3 emissions included in the tools so that our customers can actually see, you know, you know, where the sources of emissions are coming from, whether that be operation, whether it be our, our energy sources, or, or of course our scope 3, so things like our hardware, uh, you know, that go into our server racks and etc. And then, you know, we have, we have a lot more plans going into this year, so we kind of hit a measure of success to have complete verified reporting and in 2026 we're, we're looking to increase the customer experience and additional granularity and, and keep, uh, keep serving our customers to be able to enable their sustainability initiatives and we'll touch a little bit more on that later, um, but you know, really, you know, we we'll, we'll continue to hear from our customers like Adobe, like Salesforce. On what they need and, and really be responsive to that. So I talked about what scope 12, and 3, right? Some of you may be like, OK, that's old, old news. I, I know what that means. Some of you might not know what those scopes are. So I'll just give a quick, quick recap on what, uh, scopes 12, and 3. So if we're thinking about carbon accounting, it's similar to financial accounting, this is actually how we account for the emissions that we generate as a business, um, so there's something called scope 1. Emissions, um, this is like our operational emissions, so things like our, uh, uh, you know, backup generators or others that are, we're fully responsible for. There's scope 2, which is essentially where we're getting our energy from the grid, and so the sources of energy that actually supply our data centers, and then there's scope 3, which are basically all. All the components, materials, hardware, cement, everything that goes into our actual physical data centers, uh, to actually power all the compute that services, um, that we're actually providing to, um, to our customers and so just as sort of like a recap on all of those, uh, that sort of, uh, just to provide that visibility. So how do we actually compute this assembly footprint, the carbon footprint, so we have a variety of different data sources that come from around our business. So, um, things like hardware components and processors, uh, data center building materials and equipment like what I did, we talked about all the way down to the cement. Uh, the energy consumption, uh, where the grid source, uh, water usage, all of these different data sources we actually take in from the all over our business to be able to, to, to compute this footprint and actually provide it out to our customers. And so this all feeds into something to what I was talking about, the customer carbon footprint tool that we actually built to, to supply this to our customers. Uh, so we, how do we do this? We go through a couple of different steps of obviously we have to ingest, uh, millions of data points from around the customer, uh, excuse me, around the company to be able to, to actually generate that number. Uh, we orchestrate that, so obviously we have numbers coming in that are. On an hourly cadence, on a, on a, on a daily, weekly, monthly, right, so we have different orchestration of how we pull in and generate those numbers and actually, uh, tally them all up into our total total footprint. Uh, we also, because it's carbon, we often, uh, need to either apply an emissions impact factor or, uh, we have a team of scientists that actually model the. Carbon emissions of things like our, our components that feed into our server racks, uh, and then of course we need to persist and govern that data because it is data from around our entire company which feeds into some of our downstream, um, analysis and acts. So how we actually plan and forecast what we're doing to meet our 2040 objectives and of course how we're reporting monthly through the customer carbon footprint tool. And, uh, so I talked a little bit about how we kind of progressively take all these different components down, uh, if you, this is sort of how we go step by step on breaking down our top-down allocation for carbon emissions and so we actually do look at across all our regions. We, uh, are looking down to the server racks, allocating to our, our foundational services, something like EC2 or S3, and then allocate those out to our non-foundational services. These are the ones that run directly on services like EC2 which are running on hardware. Uh, and then essentially we allocate that out to our customers. So, uh, across all of our AWS accounts we actually then do, uh, an allocation model to say, OK, hey, you know, Adobe across all of your accounts, this is the, the portion of the emissions that your usage is generating based on, um, AWS's footprint. Uh, so this is a quick screenshot of the customer carbon footprint tool. I also, uh, quick call out that we have our product manager Marta Fraga here who's actually, uh, supports the customer carbon footprint tool and we'll be at a demo. We'll, we'll, we'll segue it to that later, but if you can see sort of like this is sort of the, the screenshot, you navigate it to an. In billing console and you find the tab and we can look at both market-based emissions and location-based emissions and then you have different data exports in terms of the range that you can pull for for your needs. Uh, this would be actually our market-based emissions of a of a a of a a sample account of course this is nobody in in particular's account, but you can see sort of the example here and then here is our location-based emissions so. This was just sort of an overview on how we've actually got to the point where we are now across all of our sort of sustainability objectives and getting down to the CCFT. So now I just wanna turn it over to Eric to talk a little bit about how this work, how we partnered and, and worked on this. All right, thanks. Thanks Alexis, this is great. Appreciate everyone being here. It's definitely been, uh, a journey. Uh, Salesforce has been a customer of us of, uh, AWS for a while, and, um, you know, kudos to you guys for consistently pushing the envelope and, and, and, um, bringing more sophistication to a very complicated problem. So thank you everyone who's worked on it, um. America Etz and I lead our tech sustainability program at Salesforce. Um, wanna give you guys a kind of a big picture of what, what we mean when we say Salesforce, uh, sustainability. Um, I'll talk about four quick pillars and then we'll dive a little bit deeper into our infrastructure program. So you know. Emissions reduction is probably one of the biggest first starting points that we, we focus on. Um, we want to be net zero by 2040 as well, um, and that's, you know, looking at long term scope one and two targets, total, uh, uh, carbon as well as our carbon intensity for our scope 3 targets. Uh, you can see those reflected up there. Um, to do this we have to reduce our value chain emissions significantly. Um, that's scope 12, and 3, and, um, we wanna be more efficient internally. The things we have control over for the shared responsibility model, but we also, you know, rely on and work with our, our main, uh, providers like, uh, like AWS to, to continue pushing the envelope and decarbonizing. We have an agent force for Net Zero cloud product which is essentially a sustainability management console, uh, uh, and, and helps our clients, you know, really track, analyze, report, and reduce their environmental and social impacts. So it's something if you're, if you're, if you're in, in that industry, you should take a look. It's a great way to, to, to. Um, to tally and, and, and footprint, and then we have agents, uh, as you know, uh, Salesforce is, is big on, uh, agents as many of you are, and, and there's a lot of, uh, internal and external agents that are doing a lot of great work with sustainability, and if we wanna talk about that near the end we can, um, for as far as energy transition goes, we are pushing hard, um, to continue moving the industry forward for ourselves we have been 100% renewable energy since 2021 and, um. You know that is scope 1 and 2. We are looking further than that. We're looking at location-based grid emissions. We're looking at, you know, our scope 3. We're trying to, you know, look at, you know, as the market is, market-based emissions by time and space and consider what the right thing is for the world and the economy. Um, we're helping to innovate at scale, right, and scale, uh, uh, certain technologies, um, whether that's, you know, efficiency, fuels, uh, renewables, removals, um, pushing the industry where we can, where we don't necessarily have direct control, but we have, um, you know, our, our, our influence. We wanna be nature positive. Nature positive doesn't always show up in everyone's sustainability reports, but it's important to us. We believe that the health of business relies on the health of nature. It's kind of a no-brainer. We all float around on this rock together. However, there have been studies from the World Economic Forum and others that say that there's a tremendous amount of economic value. In fact, $10 trillion worth of annual business value and almost 400 million jobs that could be developed by 2030. Uh, if we implement nature positive, uh, uh, policies out there, so, huge to think about, we wanna reduce our impact. We've talked a lot about, uh, uh, carbon, but water is a huge focus. It's a hyperlocalized, um, resource. We're thinking about it at our data centers, resilience of the power grids. Power grids use a lot of water, something we're very focused on going forward, and, um, we're also thinking about investing in upstream watersheds, quite, quite literally upstream, uh, to make sure that that that we have resilient sources of water to, uh, continue powering our, our data centers and our offices, um. We also have a $100 million dollar, uh, you know, nature and sustainability fund. We, we are looking at nature-based solutions for, for decarbonizing, um, you know, through nature solutions like, uh, the One Trillion Tree initiative. Many of you may have heard of that OneT.org, uh, very important initiative, and then we, we recognize that. Big companies are not going to do this alone. We have, uh, we have to foster an environment where eco-preneurs, small mission-driven companies that are doing a lot of good sustainability work, can be successful, um, and, and through our philanthropy, or ventures work, um, putting our full capital stack at play there to support them. So when we talk about our Infrastructure sustainability program. I'm, I'm focused on a few things, you know, over this year into next year, uh, on that right side. So all of these stuff. So, so keep, keep an ear out for what, how, uh, data transparency and data, you know, feeds into each of these things, and I'll talk about that a little more in the next slide. But, you know, first and foremost, we're, we're transitioning to public cloud. We have a lot of our co-location data centers currently. Um, but we are rapidly, we've been rapidly deploying on AWS over the last few years. That requires a lot of data to understand sort of the right, the right, um, you know, economic incentives, the right, uh, sustainability, um, you know, impacts, and then going forward, making the case for, for continued, um, deployment and but to do that we also have to right size that utilization. We don't, we don't wanna just. You know, willy-nilly just throw all, all of our capacity without making sure we're doing it in the right, most mindful, uh, thought out way. So we have been right sizing our utilization and, and getting much more efficient over the last few quarters and years really. Um, and in the shared sustainability, excuse me, shared responsibility model, we have thought a lot about cost driven optimizations, um, you know, fin ops professionals, if they're, if you're in here, it sounds like there's a few, you think a lot about, you know, keeping costs low and thinking about the cost to serve and, and unit costs. We do the same thing with a carbon lens, and they're very, very similar, uh, pathways. Um, and it's OK to, you know, work together and, and, and one ride the coattail of the other, and oftentimes work together to double sort of the, the impact and the incentive the, you know, business drivers, but this includes things like, you know, selecting the right instances which I think a lot of you are thinking about using S3 intelligent tiering, upgrading to EBS, you know, GP3, things like that, you know, suspending or releasing ODCR capacity, things that make you more efficient and, um, drive costs down and, and carbon down. We're also kind of taking a view of of our own infrastructure, deploying our customers. Uh, uh, in a, in a more efficient and effective way, so we think about the efficiency as, you know, and we try to benchmark where they should be based on where we, you know, we, we seek similar customers, and try to help give them tools to, to deploy the most effectively, which then of course makes us more efficient as well. But we're staying mindful of regions, regions for, you know, carbon intensity but also water, uh, stress, big deal, and, and we're giving customers an option to actually deploy or migrate. Um, either from their co-location, uh, to, to clean regions or from, you know, AWS to ADWS regions, um, uh, as they, as they, you know, if, if they have priorities to be in the greener regions, we're trying to develop software code that's more, you know, efficient, elegant, uh, uh, and, and avoids anti-patterns that really can, um, drag resource utilization down. So it all starts with that underlying code, um, and it's both human generated code and. Uh, AI generated code that we're really trying to think about going forward, um, we're tracking water, uh, we're talking e-waste, uh, we're, we're, we're trying to set the performance expectations, trying to understand when we're talking about WE and PUE, we're talking, we're thinking about climate, we're thinking about where, you know, what is the right strategy, the trade-offs between, um, carbon and water, um, and so data is, you know, highly. Important for that and then of course we're continuing to engage a variety of stakeholders, customers, regulators, investors and data is, is super uh super important for for those purposes. So Wanted to kind of reiterate some of the things, you know, different types of data have different purposes, and you know we need a lot of it for a lot of different purposes, right? So location-based grid emissions is important for certain, uh, uses market-based we require and, and thank you guys for, for continuing to push to, to bring more types of data to us. Scope 12, and 3, that the supply chain is, is really important as we, you know, become more sophisticated with the decisions we make as. Customers, suppliers, our, uh, customers, it's a big ecosystem where we have to all, all think and work together, um, and so, um, that as, as sort of dissected by master payer accounts, sub-accounts, by, by regions, by, um, service level stuff, WEE we talked about by region, but you know, all regions with with withdrawals and, and potentially in the future a variety of, of other things which are kind of put there um those are kind of. in my brain of things, and I know you guys have been thinking about those too. So, those 4 categories to the right are sort of where we use things. Like, so footprinting, right? We, we have to keep track of historicals. We, we do that internally, um, to track, you know, where we are and where we're hitting our goals, but we also have to do external reporting. Um, either through our stakeholder impact report we have to plug in, um, you know, the CDP or the 10K filings, things like that, that all requires data from the CCFT and, and AWS to, to get that right. Forecasting and trendsetting, we take historicals, think into the future. We, we have science-based targets we have to hit. In 2040 and we need to know what trends we're on and and how we're doing with our current and and forecasting going forward um we you internally it sort of dovetails with this internal analysis but it goes kind of a level deeper because we think about each of our business units. Many of you know Salesforce is a CRM company, which obviously it is, but we. We have a lot of other arms we we do marketing and commerce. We have Slack under our umbrella now and um Tableau, MuleSoft, a lot of, um, these products that that people know and love but do have sort of different businesses, different metrics, and as we think about that, we need AWBS data to match with that to, to, to help us find, um, patterns and, and, um, kind of, uh, opportunities and then lastly is is stakeholders we. You know, we talk about engaging customers that is hugely important for us. Our customers are constantly asking for what their usage of, of, uh, our cloud is our, our, our products are. And of course we, we rely on, on AWS in many cases to sort of pass through some of that data, um, but also when we set expectations for suppliers and we engage our suppliers, we think about industry benchmarking, all of that stuff is gonna be required, um, and we think a lot about, uh, how we can bring that data into the richest way possible, so. With that, I will stop. I'm gonna turn it over to Ralph from Adobe to talk and then looking forward to some discussion after that. Exactly. Thank you, Alexis. So, for that, um, nice, uh context as well as the introduction. And uh thanks, uh, Eric for, uh, walking through the, you know, uh, Salesforce sustainability journey. You know, it's inspiring to see how this um collaboration drives the collective progress in our, uh, you know, in our industry. So this is a perfect example of, uh, uh, the collaboration. And uh hello, good afternoon. My name is Rao Charahala. I'm a senior program manager at Adobe. I lead uh the initiatives in cloud fins, as well as the sustainability. So, um, So one of the things is like at Adobe, the sustainability is mindful and intentional. So that, the thing that we wanted to, uh Kind of do is that The Sustainability is not a, uh, kind of journey. It's, it's not a just, it's not a destination. So it is actually ingrained as a business, uh, DNA within, within Adobe. Um, one of the things that I wanted to Focus on here is that Adobe stands, uh, Adobe Sustainability Journeys stands on three pillars. So, one is the product pillar. And the product pillar is where we are developing the digital workflows for our customers to enable their process flows. And the second one is that operational sustainability. In the operational sustainability, we are enabling our internal as well as external operations and efficiencies. And the 3rd 1 is that we collaborate. Which is the advocacy. We collaborate with our partners, with our customers, so, so that it, we are actually going together as, uh, one partner model. And to enable this strategy, we are actually Uh, we have actually developed 5, guiding principles. One is empower our customers through our products. Um, you all probably aware, Adobe Acrobat, um, I'm sure most of you are using Adobe Acrobat. Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Document Cloud, through which we enable digital workflows, and through which we save billions of papers, uh, which is, you know, printing, and also Adobe Sign through which. Uh, we are enabling the digital signatures, whereby, you know, uh, reducing the logistical carbon. So, uh, 2nd 1 is that building the sustainable, innovative workspaces for our employees. So our facilities are 80% of them are LEEDS certified. So what that means is that, um, it, you know, uh, one of our recent, uh, buildings at, uh, Adobe headquarters. Which, which has on-site renewable energy, as well as, uh, our own water, uh, circulation system, which reduces the load on, uh, municipality. So the third area is that reducing, uh, the boosting of productivity with, uh, with, within our own, um, data centers for the scope 1, scope 2 emissions, um, whereby reducing the, uh, PUE, uh, and also kind of, uh, um, cutting down on the emissions. The 4th area is the employee engagement. So we have a number of green teams, and they engage thousands of our own employees, who actually kind of, uh, uh, do, uh, 90% of our waste recycling. Uh, that happens as part of the green teams and the effort. The last one is, uh, what we call it as a, um, Uh, transparency. So bringing the transparency that is through annual sustainability reports. The annual sustainability report, which not only kind of provides all the um environmental parameters, uh, but also brings down what is the ethical AI, ethical and sustainable AI, and as well as the data transparency into the, uh, you know, mix of it. So these are the different. Uh, there are the 5 guiding principles that drives our overall strategy. So obviously, it is not just, um, you know, uh, Adobe, but I think it's partnership with our, uh, partners as well as the customers. Now, when it comes to our commitments, so we have our North Star. North Star is to become net zero by 2050. So, which is kind of very similar to most of your organizations. So, however, So these, the milestones that you see here, the, uh, commitments that you see here, they're not just, uh, aspirations, but they are milestones, um, to our progress. So two of the important milestones, which you can see here is that, uh, our operations, um, which is scope one, scope two, reducing, uh, our emissions by 42% by 2030. And the Second, one target is that our supply chain reducing the emissions by 52%, um, which is where our cloud, as well as our supply chain, uh, they sit in this, in this category. And Apart from that, so we have, uh, 4 of the different operational milestones, um, 100% renewable energy, electricity by 2025, and then 90% of our waste has global waste recycling diversion. And, again, 80% of our energy, uh, buildings are continue to maintain the LEED certification, and then 25%, uh, is, uh, you know, reduced the water consumption goal, um, you know, both within our own data center as well as, uh, kind of overall per employee. So, sustainability, uh, driving sustainability, uh, is not, uh, as a kind of, it's a shared responsibility. Um, obviously, uh, you know, the partnership is a very important aspect. Um, one, So, there are 3 things that to keep in mind. One is the data, right? So from data, uh, deriving the insights, that's one, important aspect. Second one is that reporting aspect. From data to reporting. So we have several types of reports, right? So, uh, sustainability, uh, disclosures, and, uh, And, uh, you know, uh, deep dive, deep diving the internal reports, uh, to understand, uh, the carbon footprint for each of the, uh, products. And the third thing is that, uh, how we are actually kind of going to get that programmatic data access, uh, to, uh, to our, uh, from the CCFT standpoint. So, um, our partnership with the AWS is that, um, Our inventory, Adobe inventory is standards aligned as well as we are greenhouse gas protocol enabled, but where the CCFT data adds value is that it enhancing the data. Uh, for, so that, that, I mean, we, we do our own data in the form of, uh, uh, spend-based estimates. So, to bring this, uh, the precision together, so that is where the, uh, the scope 3 data that plays an important role here. So, again, um, in summary, so, uh, the, Again, sustainability is a shared responsibility and a shared progress that we are making. Um, Thank you for, uh, all the, uh, you know, support from the AWS and of that, you know, we were kind of bringing that information together. Um, again, um, let's make every pixel and every partnership count. Thank you. Awesome. Thank you. Awesome. Thank you. Actually, the funny story is, uh, last year Rao and one of his colleagues Tridar and were said that this year we wanted to be on stage talking about how he delivers scope 3 and so we actually came full circle moment that we are here on stage presenting that. So we just have a few, a little bit more, uh, to wrap up here, so. Um, so obviously as you saw the headline of our talk, collaboration is key, right, and sustainability, we can't do this in isolation sitting up here with two of our, our customers, right, and telling us how we need to kind of meet our commitments and our goals and drive transparency, um, but also, you know, their part in, you know, driving their sustainability initiatives and the demand. Um, things that we could, there are things that you can do like running well architected pillar reviews that have a sustainability dimension so you can work with account managers and any of our technical field community to do those, those type of sessions, um, but of course, you know, like I started the talk today and I saw that only 3 of you have seen the CCFT, so that means by the end of this conference. I want all of you guys to have seen the CCFT, so please go see Marta and some of our, our good friends over in the, in the showcase of the Venetian. We have, there's a very large sign that says sustainability. There's a bunch of cool demos. Please go and, and, you know, check it out. It, it will be worth your time, I promise, uh, and then a shameless plug as I'm doing another. Other talk tomorrow, uh, where we actually talk about how we built some of our core data infrastructure using AWS Native services. So please also join me for that if you want to see a little bit more of the guts of like how we built this, um, using some of our core data and AI services that actually feed this into the customer carbon footprint tool which you can do. Um, with a few minutes left, I had kind of heard some conversations in these early days about maybe some topics we just wanna, um, you know, we got, we got about 9 minutes left to just kind of bring some of these, um, some questions and topics I've heard, and so did wanna kind of, um, uh, ask you guys a few questions while we're still here together and, and I think the elephant in the room that I've heard from some folks, uh, is Gen AI. Right, and so we, we obviously we're here as sustainability professionals, but wanted to get your take a little bit on like how, you know, as large organizations like um Adobe and Salesforce are starting to kind of grapple with, you know, being, you know, in a sustainability position but also with the growth of AI and we know there are more environmental pressures with that. So maybe I just ask, you know, Eric if you wanna like comment or yep, sorry, Ralph. Sure. Uh, I can, I can start. I think a couple of things is that, I mean, GAI is really a force multiplier. Uh, certainly, Uh, it has a double edge. Uh, one is that kind of a positive from the opportunities standpoint, there are a couple of opportunities, several opportunities. One is to kind of how, uh, we can bring that, uh, uh, unstructured data together and then to kind of, from data to insights, uh, you know, that is certainly is feasible from the sustainability, uh, data standpoint. And also to bring that to all the way to the, you know, ESG disclosures that we publish. So, uh, that, that's something that we do and that has been happening, um, but, uh, on the other side which is the challenges front is, uh, obviously kind of, uh, you know, um, we all know there are a couple of things that are adding up. One is that, uh. You know, the more, uh, you bring in the, uh, the GPUs, uh, then, you know, you are adding more energy and your water consumption. So which, like, for an organization like AWB, the, uh, you know, carbon footprint is growing, right. And the other area is that, you know, you are, you are refreshing that GPUs so frequently. There is an e-waste, uh, that is, that is happening unless you are kind of extending the inner, uh, life of that, uh, you know, uh, GPUs within that. So, uh, I think, uh, because, you know that when you are looking at that accounting part of it, right, so you are, uh, accounting that to the customers as well from the, you know, hyper scales to, uh, Customers. So that, this is where uh the opportunities, there are opportunities, there are uh challenges, um. But I think it, it's, it's, it, it, it also kind of depends on like, uh, when we look at the finally like ROI versus the cost. So we, we are kind of, you know, I mean, I know sustainability is one of the pillars, uh, for the well architected framework, um, but what we are, what we were trying to do is that to introduce the sustainability as, as part of the region selection process. So that's, that's, that's something, uh, is, uh, you know, definitely is, uh, helpful from that. Yeah, I mean, obviously we, we're looking at a lot of scary things in the, in the future that may come from AI, but I, I'm a, I'm, I'm, I'm fairly bullish on it. I, I, I think that AI is actually gonna help sustainability quite a bit. Um, yes, we have to be mindful of our data center energy usage, and we will, um, but I honestly think that AI has an opportunity to transform these infrastructure systems, right? When you're talking about data centers, you know, being able to, to do better, uh, intelligent automation really allows you to save costs, be more reliable, be more efficient. Um, and even upstream from that, like the, the power grids, right, you, you, there, there's a, a tremendous amount of opportunity, I think, to forecast, you know, supply and demand with around time and space to, to get more, um, uh, you know, benefits there, you know, in, in, uh, integrate more renewables to the grid, things like that. So I, I'm excited and also it's gonna accelerate innovation. Um, the IEA, I think, said that 50% of the carbon reduction we're gonna see in 2050 will come from technologies not even invented yet. Which means that we gotta get these technologies online and the faster we can do that the better, and AI, I think it's really gonna push that forward quite a bit, um, and I think just modeling, I think AI does this really great we just take so much data and, and, and help us model things, you know, and when we think about mitigation, whether it's like near term stuff around like, you know, flood risk or ice, you know, sea ice change, things like that, or, or, you know, longer term things like, uh, drought or, you know, tree canopy, uh, you know, uh, growth and, and, uh, water, uh, retention. Those are important and then even policies like how certain programs will change behaviors like you know carbon pricing, things like that. AI can help generate models around what's gonna be the most impactful and and help our policymakers and our uh businesses and and other organizations do better. So it's just an exciting time. I think just like for the rest of the world and industry there's, there's all opportunities, but I think uh sustainability really needs to leverage AI as much as possible, um. And I think the whole industry would be better for it. Yeah, awesome, great comments. I mean, I will also say that, you know, we, as, as an engineering manager myself, right, we, we have our developers building products at a faster pace than ever before, leveraging some of our core, you know, developer products, um, uh, like Quiro, and then of course, you know, tomorrow I'll talk a little about like Bedrock where we're actually using that to make insight. And and action ability more accessible to all of our internal and eventually external stakeholders as well. So we're saying, you know, obviously some of the kind of daunting things that we need to continue to operate more efficiently, but then also how we're building and supplying more sustainably transparency and progress leveraging AI. So we're also seeing that here with AWS as well, um. So I wanted to ask just, you know, one more question. We, we, we, and may maybe we'll have time for a third one, but we, um, uh, obviously talked about our journey this year, right? And, and, and, you know, kind of where we thought we were last year we were, we were like we're never gonna get there, but, but we got here and we're, we're on the stage saying, you know, we've. Kind of reach this this moment. Do you think we're, we're done? Have we like checked the box? Are we, we ready to go home now? Or what else, you know, are Adobe and Salesforce like needing from AWS in this space? Can you talk a little bit about like how you, you know, some of the initiatives you're driving and, and what, how we're gonna continue to collaborate? Yeah, I mean, I kind of a loaded question, right? We're, we're never gonna be done, uh, I think, as sustainability professionals we have to keep pushing the envelope and again tremendous amount of progress. The, the, we, it's not mission, uh, complete quite yet, uh, for any of us, um, but I, I do wanna reiterate that customers really do care, and I think the world cares. I, I, I know we're in a time right now of very interesting political winds, um. And I think it's a time for business to lead, like, show, show leadership and, and be true to your values. The pendulums will continue swinging, uh, constantly for the next 100, 200, 500 years. So you know, I think the, the importance of sustainability, it's not just about. Hugging some trees, it's really, truly about delivering social value, economic value, business value, longevity of your business, de-risking, you know, improving a variety of different things that are associated with, with your business, driving down costs, etc. etc. etc. So for us, excuse me, it is not, it is not done. Thank you for your partnership. We want you to keep, keep going. I think the things we would like to see is, you know, just continued accessibility, more, uh, access to our data and maybe even better tools, maybe easier, uh, you know, APIs, more recent data, right? Like, no, you know, no, no lag time, which I know is on the horizon, which is exciting, um. Granularity of data, right, you know, we sometimes look at very high levels, but going forward we're gonna go deeper and deeper and deeper in our stack and try to understand where the, the carbon footprint's coming so we can analyze that at a better level to, to help us, you know, make better decisions in our sustainability program, and I think probably, uh, you know, action ability or identifying opportunities within. Our deployments on AWS is an area where we'd love your support more and more and more and help us understand the places and that shared responsibility model. I know it's there's a very clear pink and blue category, but the reality is, you know, you know so much about your infrastructure. You know so much about running. You know, workloads on the cloud that the, the more you can help your customers figure out ways to be more efficient, I think would be great. So these are, these are things we could talk about next year, right? And the year after and the year after. We'll, we'll, we'll stay busy. Yes, yeah, I could just say ditto, but, um, but one of the things though, uh, certainly more and more of our customers are asking. Um, about the, you know, what's the carbon footprint for your, you know, product X. Uh, we are not there yet. Uh, I think we, uh, at this point in time to kind of trying to, um, bring that together to be able to dissect and then allocate it to, uh, the product level. It takes a little bit more for the effort. So that's a, that's one use case. And the other one is that, uh, you know, um, again, mostly the customers from the Europe, they started asking the questions about, uh, you know, uh, AI, GI footprint, and, uh, I, I think, you know, again, that all points to that, uh, what, uh, Eric, you are mentioning about, uh, uh, the data granularity and the data accessibility. Um, I, I think that those are the top, uh, items, uh, on our agenda as well. And then we are actually kind of, uh, excited about, uh, the, um, console, CCFT console. And uh it's, it's so because of that, that gives them more access uh also kind of uh from that standpoint, um, and, and, uh, of course, the one of the exciting things that you were uh mentioning about in the roadmap is, uh, uh, the, you know, monthly data, uh, availability of monthly data. So yeah, no, I mean, I think, uh, uh. For the last 12 months or so, I think there's a tremendous progress that's been made, but certainly, you know, continue to push the envelope for Um, data accessibility and the granularity. That's awesome. I mean, I always like to hear that there's gonna be plenty of work for my engineers for, for a while to come. So sounds like we got a lot of things coming. So we have a, a lot of things planned, and as I look over at Marta, who will be one of the key orchestrators, um, in 2026, so keep watching this place. Lots of interesting things in terms of where we're driving granularity so that, uh, partners like yourselves, like Adobe, like Salesforce can continue to kind of innovate on AWS, uh, with sustainability in mind. Uh, so really thankful for you guys joining today. Like I said, just one more like shameless plug. Go to our demo desk in the showcase big sustainably sign. Uh, I would love to see your faces again tomorrow at the other session where we're actually gonna do a chalk talk building out sort of the infrastructure how we built, um, some of the underlying, I like to call it guts of the CCFT. So, uh, would definitely be happy to, uh, see you there as well. Also, please rate our session, uh, 5 out of 5 stars. We are, you know, sustainability is still fundamental, right? It's still super. Important. So wanna keep bringing back these insights and, and bringing back these perspectives for you. So I really appreciate your time today. Don't forget AWS SkillsBuilder, um, here's my obligated, uh, slide that I need to pop up for you, um, but we'll also, I kinda did sort of a, a pre-curated set of questions, but we'll be around for a few minutes if you wanna come up and chat to us after. So thank you again so much.
