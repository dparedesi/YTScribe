All right, everybody here in theater 3 happening now, secure, easy and performant VPC resource connectivity with tail scale. Take it away, Lee. Thank you very much. Um, as just mentioned, I'm here to talk to you about tail scale, secure, easy, and performant VPC resource connection. Activity with tail scale. Now, two words of warning, this is a sponsored presentation, and I do work in sales, so if you feel compelled to part ways with your hard earned money as a result of this presentation, that means it's gone well. I think I can make a pretty compelling argument for why you should do that anyway, but let's talk a little bit about an agenda, um. The pain of connecting to private VPC resources, there are many, many ways to solve this problem. You likely have this problem already, but you probably have experienced some pain at some point here. Uh, and I'm gonna talk about how Tailscale does things a little bit differently. I'm gonna talk about the. Power of wireguard which underpins tailscale's connectivity solution. I'm gonna talk about some use cases. I'm gonna talk about how you can do it right and how you can do it wrong, and then you'll see that it says demo on here, this is Las Vegas. I was out too late last night, we're not getting a demo today. So what does private VPC resource access look like today? Well, what we have found, or what I have found prior to being a solutions engineer, I was a a system administrator, DevOps engineer, platform engineer, whatever the title is this week. Um, and what we generally found is that actually connecting to things that are inside your VPC that are in a private subnet that are not exposed to the public internet is fraught with complexity. If you want to connect two VPCs together, you're immediately in VPC peering pain or you have to deal with transit gateways. You are. You have limited visibility and control, sure you can send all these things to cloudWatch and Cloud trail, but does anybody ever actually look at those things? Um, the, the, the, the costs of doing these things are immediately, uh, painful, like, you know, AWBS announced regional nat gateways, that's a, a great change, but every single bite or every single packet that goes through those gets charged, and that's an expensive operation. And then finally and most importantly, I'd imagine everybody. Nobody here who's had any technology-based background has used a VPN at some point in their lives, and they've probably had to reboot their laptop because the VPN has gone wonky or caused you some level of frustration. These are things that we hear about at Telscale all day. Every single time we talk to a new company, they have an existing connectivity solution and they say the developer experience is really, really poor, it's impacting my productivity, it's making things really, really painful. The complexity can be kind of described a little bit like this. This is a nice visualization of a pretty typical VPN or connectivity topology. You might have some sort of VPN hub and then you might have a gateway in another region or a gateway in another VPC. It's very limited to the network it works. Model that you have originally ascribed to, and if you have a problem at some point in this path, if a developer is trying to get into an RDS database or a developer is trying to get to something that's only an internal resource, and they can't achieve that even though they're on the VPN. They don't have any idea how to solve that problem, that's immediately an IT ticket or it's somebody else who's gonna have to solve that problem for them. We hear all the time how painful and frustrating that is and the topology here is a is a an artifact of that. So A lot of these VPNs were built on technology that was designed for a day when your work machine was under your desk and was not a portable machine. It had a cable plugged into it, so you might be familiar with er VPN technology with encryption that is TLS based and so it uses certificate-based encryption. A lot of the pain points that you see in the complexity that we just talked about are because of that lack of design for modern networks. We. Wi Fi now, we have laptops, we have cell phones, you're on the move all the time. People are working from coffee shops, they're working from their homes, they're working from the office. Things are moving around a lot more. And so in the, in the mid 2010s, uh, a gentleman called Jason Donnenfeld felt so empowered to, to fix this problem that he designed a new connectivity solution called Wireguard. If you're familiar with it, it was built from the ground up from our modern networks. It has fewer bottlenecks, um, which means you. You can connect all of the devices in a network together. Um, it's way more lightweight and predictable, um, so it's a much more smaller boat codebase. It was written from the ground up, um, it has an entirely new cryptography stack underneath it, and it is really, really good in situations when you're moving around a lot. It self heals the connectivity path. So I can close my laptop and open it again and my VPN is not gonna go all, all sideways and force me to reboot the machine. That. That was one of the reasons that why a guide was was was designed. And we at Tailscale have built our products on top of that technology. So we are the easiest way for you to get all of the benefits of this new built cryptography and this new built connectivity solution without having to do things like key management, without having to do identity, without having to figure out how you're gonna build a client that works. Telscale is a very, very straightforward way to get to get all of those benefits. We, as we said, we built it on on Wireguard. We embedded identity directly into the product, so we are SSO driven. We don't charge extra for SSO it's all based right from the, it's all um required for you to actually sign up for the product. No usernames and passwords, none of that kind of like legacy security stuff. It works on any operating system, any device, in any location. So one of our engineers recently compiled tail scale for an old um operating system. We work on your cell phone, we work on your laptop, we work on vehicle entertainment. Systems, we work on, you know, we have tailscale deployed in submarines, we have tailscale deployed in farms, there's tailscale about to get launched into space, we will work basically anywhere. And one of the, my favorite, um, piece pieces of tailscale is that we actually handle navigating out of your network for you. So you don't need to open any ports, you don't need to open any security groups. It will, it will connect these two devices together via the magic of our natroversial. And so when we layer the identity on top of that, you, instead of the other topology that we looked at earlier, you end up with something that looks a little bit like this. Every device is aware of every other device in the network, every device can communicate with every other device in the network. We have embedded the identity of that device into the client, and so then we decide what you're actually allowed to communicate with based on. Who you are and who you've logged in as. And so we build this huge mesh of nodes, and then we build an ACL system on top of that, which will allow you to be able to determine, you know, can this person access this RDS database? Is this person able to access this EC2 instance? And so rather than thinking about this from a network level segmentation, we think about it from an identity-based segmentation. What sort of things does this open up for you? Well. I've used the term VPN quite a lot already in the 6 or 7 minutes of this presentation, but what we are finding from our customers is that, This can solve a whole bunch of things that traditional VPNs or traditional connectivity solutions cannot solve for you. So we've talked a little bit about a standard kind of business VPN use case. You have employees that are on the road, working remotely, they need to get access to internal applications that you need to secure, um, and we can solve that problem very, very straightforwardly. We can also. Solve some more AWS and like what we call machine to machine based use cases. So if you look at the the concept of CICD if you're using GitHub and GitHub's manage runners, you might wanna run a database migration. But the GitHub managed runner is outside of your security boundary. Because Tailscale is so lightweight and small, you can drop tailscale into a GitHub action workflow. Uh, we have a GitHub action workflow that will do set up tail scale and connect you to CICD pipeline, and you can now run those, you know, RDS migrations or talk to your EKS cluster that has an internal API really, really easily with just a single step in a workflow. And it's, it's a really straightforward way of kind of enabling connectivity to things that you couldn't previously do. Um, you look at things like workload connectivity. I don't know about you, but I, I've certainly run, you know, some of the agentic AI based things that are running amok around, um, my laptop. I'm able to delete random files and do whatever it wants. The workload connectivity, um, and the securing AI tenants of our platform allow you to actually secure those things and stop those things running rampant, um, and doing things that you, you know, really don't want them to do. Workload connectivity is really interesting because previously the way you would solve this, I know there were some announcements today about cross-cloud um connectivity for like Google Cloud and AWS. We have large organizations right now solving that exact problem with Tailscale. They just dropped two tailscales. Agents, one in Google Cloud, one in AWS, so they drop, um, you know, uh, something in their ADBS VPC and something in their data center or in their office, and that immediately connects those two things together. There's no configuration, no firewall changes, no setup, it just works straight away. Um, the other two I think are Edge and IOT, um, because Tailscale is so small and lightweight, if you are, you know, deploying things like kiosks to, um, to different stores, or if you are deploying, you know, robots and, and all that kind of stuff, you can actually install tailscale directly on those things which will help you with things like getting telemetry off them. Or debugging debugging problems in those environments, you know, it costs millions of dollars for organizations to send technicians out to fix things that are in the field. You can install tailscale on those devices and fix them remotely without having to get people on the road. It saves you millions. It can save you millions of dollars. We have customers saving millions of dollars on Edge and IoT. And then finally, Our go to market motion is that you are gonna love our product so much that you want to take it to work. And so I'll talk a little bit later in the presentation about our pricing structure, but our um default setting is that you use Tailscale for your home lab. We offer very generous, uh, a very generous personal tier. So if you have video cameras at home or you wanna check the contents on your smart fridge and you wanna do all that remotely, Tailscale is a free and easy way to solve that problem. So we talked about some of the real world problems here. Developer access to resources in AWS is the kind of straightforward one. You have EC2 instances, you wanna debug why that uh EKS pod didn't start properly, so you wanna get to EKS worker mode, you wanna get into a database to fix a production issue, you, you know, want to, um, Get access to anything that is only confined to the VPC. Telscale can solve that quickly and easily and straightforwardly. If you want to connect two ABS regions together or two ADS organizations together, or perhaps you want to enable your customers to be able to communicate back to your infrastructure in a secure way, Telscale can solve that problem for you. We can help you with secure automation problems. We can help you things like, like I already mentioned, like GitHub actions or Terraform Cloud or Jenkins runners that need to actually communicate from outside your security boundary to inside your security boundary. And then as I already talked about the hybrid and cross cloud connectivity, um problem. I know there were some some announcements today as I already said, but we've been solving that problem for nearly 5 years. And I think we know what we're, I think we've done a pretty good job of that. That's er that's er the same slide twice, er apologies for that. um, so what does doing it wrong look like? Well, If you have too many layers of indirection, I already talked about this earlier in the presentation. If you do too many layers of indirection, if you have too many hops through an infrastructure in order to make these things work, the debugging and the user experience is really, really painful. Um, so each time you build some sort of like hub and spoke connectivity model, each one of those instances is a point of failure that can cause you problems. In really critical situations. In a mesh-based approach, there is no single point of failure. No single instance can can can break any of your connectivity workflows. We see a lot of organizations doing what we call security, security by IP address. So you might be using things like IP whitelisting. You might be doing things like only allowing access from. Certain subnets to other subnets. I've seen in my career hundreds of security groups that only allow access on port and protocol, uh, on specific IP addresses. The problem that you run into with that is what if the IP addresses change? What if, you know, things move around and you have to migrate these things? You know, that causes real world connectivity problems and so we focused on doing this via identity rather than. Via any networking level. So we wanna know who you are, we wanna know the origin of the request, and then we allow access based on that identity rather than the IP address. And then finally, I've talked about this a lot, but I really think it's worth driving home. The developer experience debt of doing these things wrong, sorry, of, of doing the things, these things, um, right, um, is, is just a, an experience that just works. It's just way better. So what does that look like for organizations that have actually adopted Tailscale? Well, Cribble has grown their organization. You can see their huge booth over there in the corner. They've been using Tailscale since the very inception of the company. They've grown by 25x in terms of their employee count, and they've had seen no, they have. No dedicated IT resources to actually manage connectivity. And they attest a huge portion of that to tailscale. Um, hugging face, um, estimated that they save 240 hours annually just on provisioning new users when they are onboarded into the organization. Um. Call light, 1000 hours saved annually with fewer VP VPN connectivity issues. 90% reduction in internal support requests from Instacart. I was, um, you know, part of the, um, the sales team that that was rolling out Instacart, and the level of of happiness that they got just from switching from one product to another, just in terms of IT tickets and like people picking up the phone saying, hey, I've got a meeting in 10 minutes and the VPN's not working, like. It, it, it made a huge difference to their business. And then in terms of actual like, like real technology performance, because we use Wireguard as our underlying encryption, we've seen we can guarantee a 4x reduction in latency because we're going directly between those resources and 22 22X increase in 3. Though. Um, we can often find that with tailscale we can saturate, um, the nick inside these EC2 instances to, you know, up to the 10 gig nicks basically. So you can get full, fully encrypted connectivity, um, like full, a full throughput for most EC2 instances. So here are some diagrams that show you what that looks like in the real world. So here you can see we have an EC2 instance in a private subnet. We have the Nat gateway in a public subnet. You'll notice I haven't opened any ports in this particular example. I don't open any security groups. I only need outbound connectivity. I do not need any inbound connectivity. Uh, and Telscope can connect me to my laptop, I can run SSH commands, I can run debugging things, all those kind of things. If you're regularly SSHing into things or using something like ADBS SSM, there are a lot of things that are fraught with peril there. The fact that you don't have to open any any firewall ports is gonna make your security team very happy, I suspect. Um, we have a, um, a Kubernetes operator so we can run within, uh, EKS. Uh, we can make, we can help you, um, move your EKS control plane. Obviously the default setting is public access. Your EKS control plane, if there's a Kubernete zero day tomorrow, a lot of EKS clusters are gonna be in a really bad way. Uh, they're gonna be publicly accessible. You probably don't wanna put your MySQL database on the public internet. I don't wanna put my EKS control plane on the on the public internet. That's a very powerful API and tailscale will enable you to actually move that into a private subnet, so you no longer need to worry about that being on the public internet. And I can do, I get the same level of throughput and connectivity using the Tailscale Kubernetes operator. Um, I can also use telscale to connect, um, EKS nodes using EKS hybrid nodes. Um, so if you have remote GPUs that you want to connect from another cloud, and connect them back to your EKS control plane, Tailscale can solve that problem with you. Requiring no dedicated hardware, no, um, no capex in terms of like spend, you don't need EPSEC tunnels anymore. All you need to do is install tail scale on the on the node that you want to connect and everything will just work. There's a great blog post on the on the on the AWS, um, blog about how to do that. Um, if you want to do, as I already mentioned, like just connecting to things like, uh, uh, Amazon RDS, very common thing. I imagine most people don't want to put their RDS databases on the public internet anymore. Um, so you know, how do you actually run things like database migrations, how do you do debugging? Uh, all you have to do is run, uh, a tailscale EC2 instance. You create something called a subnet router that advertises the address of the RDS database and you can use that to proxy requests through there. We see that as a very, very common use case. And then finally, um, you know, if you want to connect two specific VPCs together, obviously you can use transit gateways. Very, very expensive, you can use VPC once it gets to more than two connections, it can be quite complicated and difficult to set up. Um, you can actually connect these two VPCs together with just 2 EC2 instances or 1 EC2 instance in each one of the VPCs, and it will connect you together really, really easily. I mentioned at the beginning, um, I believe we have a plan that's right for everybody, um, and one of the things that you could do right after, um, this presentation is go to Telscale.com and sign up for our personal tier which is free forever, up to 3 users, and 100 devices. I think that's a very, very generous tier, uh, and again, our entire. Model here is we want you to love tail scale so much that you take it to work and replace that thing that's been annoying you for years and years and years. And so you can sign up right now if you head over to our booth, um, it's booth 1818 over in the corner over there somewhere. We actually have a code as well that will give you like 3 months of our starter tier, uh, for for for free as well. So that was just about timed perfectly right, I've got about 1 minute left. Uh, I really appreciate everybody taking the time to join me today. I appreciate everybody listening to me. Uh, and I hope everybody has a great rest of the conference and thank you very much. I will be over at the booth for the next 10 to 15 minutes. If anybody has any questions, I can probably take some questions here as well, but thank you everybody.
