  Shri and Frédéric recapped 15 years of Amazon Linux evolution (AL1 in 2010, AL2 in 2017, AL2023 in 2023) and detailed the past year’s improvements to security, stability, and compliance. They reminded attendees why Amazon Linux remains the most-used OS on AWS: it is optimized for AWS services out of the box, ships frequent security fixes without licensing fees, eases operations with deep service integrations, and is ready for regulated workloads. Security work is continuous; the team evaluated tens of thousands of CVEs and shipped roughly 1,500 fixes for AL2023 this year alone, focusing on both timely patches and reducing false positives so customers are not forced into risky, unnecessary updates. Severities skew toward medium and important issues, with only a handful of criticals, underscoring the need for ongoing vigilance.
  Kernel lifecycle management was a major theme. Because the upstream LTS kernel cadence no longer aligns to OS lifetimes, customers should plan for at least one kernel upgrade during an AL2023 lifecycle. To make that painless, new SSM parameters let you pin or automatically track the “default” kernel for AL2023; if you opt into the default tag, future kernel releases (e.g., moving from 6.1 to 6.12 and beyond) are adopted transparently while predictable updates and rollback controls remain available. Explicit kernel-tagged parameters persist for customers with strict performance or compatibility requirements.
  Compliance milestones are now in place. AL2023’s cryptographic modules (OpenSSL, kernel crypto, NSS, GnuTLS, Libgcrypt) achieved final FIPS 140 validation, enabling default AMIs to run in FIPS-mandated environments. FIPS mode can be enforced at boot or per application, and a separate FIPS provider package decouples validated modules from the base OpenSSL version so revalidations can track updates. A DISA STIG for AL2023 was published in September; EC2 Image Builder and Systems Manager now offer managed documents to apply the STIG automatically during image builds or to running instances, sparing teams from manual hardening. They also flagged the approaching end-of-support for Amazon Linux 2 and urged customers to migrate to AL2023 using the new tooling and predictable update channels.
  Performance and usability saw notable gains. Upgrading to OpenSSL 3.2 (from 3.0) closed the TLS throughput gaps customers observed when moving off AL2’s OpenSSL 1.0.2; internal and customer benchmarks show 2–3x real-world TLS session improvements and up to 15x gains in synthetic tests. The FIPS provider remains installable alongside newer OpenSSL versions to preserve compliance. A new “graphical desktop” option responds to customer demand for GUI workflows (testing graphical apps, operator consoles), even though the distro is cloud-first. Finally, they reiterated Amazon Linux’s predictable quarterly releases, kernel-tag flexibility, and automation hooks as the path to keep systems secure and compliant without sacrificing stability.

Hi everyone, and welcome to the session for Amazon Linux. Before we get started, I wanted to take this, uh, moment and recognize that it's been 15 years since we launched the first version of Amazon Linux. So AL1 or Amazon Linux Army was launched in 2010. 15 years has been a long time. We've learned a lot, uh, from our customers during this uh period, as well as we've adapted to the changes, uh, that are, that have been happening upstream. I assume that many of you in the audience may have used all the 3 versions of Amazon Linux, or at least 2. So today we are excited to present to you the latest features and AWS optimations for Amazon Linux. I'm Shri, product manager for Amazon Linux, and with me I have Frederick, who is the principal engineer for Amazon Linux. So let's dive right in. In our agenda today, uh, we'll start with, uh, the Amazon Linux journey. Uh, we'll talk about the evolution of the various versions of Amazon Linux. Uh, then we will talk about the key features, uh, and the innovations that has happened on AL 2023 in this year. We will then touch upon the most important timelines, upcoming timelines for end of support for Amazon Linux 2. And then uh we will talk about what's next for Amazon Linux, what's coming up, uh, finally wrap it up so that's the agenda for today's session. So let's start with what is Amazon Linux. Amazon Linux is a Linux distribution that was created by AWS and is maintained by AWS. It is a general purpose operating system, um, and it is optimized for AWS infrastructure. It also features container-ready architecture, uh, by integrating with AWS services like EKS and ECS. As you can imagine, all of Amazon uses Amazon Linux and majority of our customers have a huge footprint on Amazon Linux. Amazon Linux is also the most popular operating system on AWS. Now let us understand why our customers and Amazon uses Amazon Linux. First, it is optimized for AWS. Amazon Linux comes with specific configurations, um, for example, cloudinet configurations, or comes with pre-installed set of uh AWS tools. So when you run your workloads on AWS, it is, it is efficient. Second, we are highly secure. Security is a top of mind for everybody. Uh, in fact, security is a fundamental element to an operating system. If you have used Amazon Linux in the past, you probably know that Amazon Linux provides security patches and bug fixes on a regular basis. We'll talk a lot more about security in the upcoming slides as well. Third, we simplify operations. By having deep integrations with various AWS services, we can do so. So let's take an example of launching an instance. So when you launch an instance, you would have to consider various parameters. For example, network configuration or attaching IAM rules or EBS volumes, or even monitoring and logging. Amazon Linux has native integrations with all these AWS services so that when you launch an instance um using Amazon Linux, it just works out of the box. Fourth is we are compliance ready. A lot of our customers in regulated industries like healthcare or finance or even government agencies, uh, for them compliance is not a nice to have. It is a must-have. Um, and, uh, Amazon Linux is compliance ready. You will hear a little bit more about, uh, Phipps and DSAtig in the upcoming slides. Last but not the least, Amazon Linux helps you lower your total cost of ownership. While you still have to pay for the compute resources, Amazon Linux has no licensing fee, and not just that, it comes with prebuilt um AWS support. This is one of the reasons that our customers really appreciate Amazon Linux and all the reasons why they use Amazon Linux. Next, let us talk a little bit about the evolution. As I was talking about uh 2025 being the 15th year for Amazon Linux. AL1 was launched in 2010, it was purpose built for the cloud, um, and had integrations with AWS uh services. We then launched AL2 in 2017, uh, which provided enhanced stability and, uh, security with a long-term support. AL2 became the most used OS, um, because of this reason. In 2023 we launched AL 2023. This is our latest version of Amazon Linux. It provides modern features and improved security defaults. So now we'll hear more about the innovations that we have done on AI 2023 uh from Frederick. I'll hand it over to you. Thank you, sir. So, 15 years of making Amazon Linux, uh, I hadn't realized it had been so long. I just became aware of it as we were preparing those slides a few weeks ago. And it just sounds crazy to me. It got me thinking like, what else, like, what have we not said about Amazon Linux in like previous sessions. This is the 3rd year in a row that we present here about Amazon IX 2023. And in fact, like my teenager will tell you that 15 years old is pretty mature. There isn't much else that you can learn once you have reached that ripe age. But just like my teenager, Amazon Lindex is picking up new tricks, like every year. And so today in this session, I'm going to tell you about some of the new tricks that Amazon Lindex has picked up in the past year. And we are going to go over, uh, kind of 33 of the key pillars of Amazon Linux, uh, development philosophy. So we are going to, we are going to cover security. And because, and see like new development that we have made in regard to Meta Linux like new news in the past year, uh, about security because this is one of the things that our customers care the most about. We are going to see some new features that we have introduced, taking great care to maintain backward compatibility because stability is the kind of the second element that we, we care a lot about when developing Amazon Amazon Linux. And then we are going to cover some like new features that we have introduced in the last year as well in direct response to specific feedback from some of you, um, because making Amazon Linux like useful to you and like the rest of our customers is the third thing that we, the team is like focusing, uh, a lot on as we, we think to Amazon Linux development over the years. So let's start, let's start with security, and let's start with like more specifically with, with CVs. Uh, if you are not familiar with what, I'm going to assume that most of you are already pretty familiar, at least partly familiar with what CVs are. If you are not, like you just need to know that CVE stands for. Um, command vulnerability and exposures. And, um, if you really don't know, like every time that you hear me say CV in the next like minute or so, just replace it in your head with security issue, and everything will still make sense. I'm sorry. So, some of the most common questions that we get from, from customers about Amazon Linux have to do with how specific CVs like affect or don't affect uh Amazon Linux versions. And this is kind of, those questions are easy to understand when you know that in every given year, The public CV databases grow by tens of thousands of new entries. Most of those don't even relate to Linux at all. And so it's kind of easy to understand why, like, it's become unrealistic to expect that every organizations and every system operators are like are able to keep up with this large flow of data that comes in all throughout the year. And this is where we come in, right? So, our team at Amazon Unex on the On a daily basis, evaluates a wider range of new CVs that affect open-source software that commonly makes up Linux distributions. And we do this with two main goals in mind, right? First, we want to make sure, and kind of obviously, right, we want to make sure that we, we can produce fixes, right, in a timely fashion for customers to deploy, and we all want to be, we want to remain aware of the kind of the threat environments out there for the Linux ecosystem. But the second aspect of our evaluation has to do with making sure that we, we keep control over kind of the false positives, right? We understand that CVT updates, while they are like required and we, we all love them, right? They all, they sometimes come with some level of operational risks. And so we want to, we want to make sure that we don't produce fixes or we don't bring new codes into Amazon that is not required. Uh, for security purposes. Um, so, a big thing that we try to do is making sure that we, we properly assess that the security issues that, that we discover, right, actually affect the version that we build in the operating system, and that the severity that have been determined by the reporters, right, makes sense and is accurate in the context of like Amazon Index as it is used by our customers. So, the outcome of this, these processes, and so far this year has been about 1500 security fixes that we have put out for Amazon Liex 2023 alone. Um, that is without counting fixes that we've done for previous versions of Amazon Linu that are still supported, uh, at this time, or at least were still supported, uh, earlier this year. If we look at a little bit at the reportation, like all the, all the, the severities spread out and all the packages spread out, uh, across this data. So we see like over 500, and it's like over 80/500 importants CVs, over 800 mediums CVs. Um, this year, the few critical, this, this is not every year. I, I think last year we had, I think we had 0 or close to 0. And we also make an effort to try to fix like as many CVs as we can while privatizing them based on severity, so we still get to fix like mediums and, and low severity CVs. What makes this data particularly interesting to me this year is that when we dove and look at actually which packages were the most affected by security issues, uh, like in the past few years, we'll see, especially this year in particular, more than half of the important severity CVs and more than half of the medium severity CVs, in fact, closer to 60%, are specifically about the Linux kernel and not the user space packages. And so, if we look at the Linux ecosystem, and this will be true for most Linux distributions, like today, we'll see that most of the threats that come in, most of the security patches that customers have to apply are, are being brought in by the kernel itself, uh, which is kind of a little bit hard to avoid for, for all of us. So, this gets us into like changes that we are making to how we maintain the Linux Kernel for Amazon Linux. So, I'm going to have to go first into like what's been happening in the upstream community, uh, about maintenance of the Linux kernel, if we look at like over the past 12 or 18 months or so. And so the The, the long-term support branches of the upstream kernel, the kernel from Linux, from uh Linux.org, uh, have changed how we have changed all their maintenance structure. And so, as they were previously maintained for like up to 6 years, right, the upstream community has now switched, I think, like a few months ago or last year, I've now switched to maintaining them for uh strictly 2 years. And that, that has a big, that has a big impact on the downstream customers. It has impact on the district vendor, but it has an impact on, on you as well as users of the Linux kernel. Because that means that considering the large volume of CVs that gets reported every year for the Linux kernel, it means that as our kernel ages, right, there's an increasing volume of security patches that need to be back ported to the aging kernels. And all of those patches come with some level of risk. And they, uh, we've, we've seen kind of increased regressions as kernels get older and patches get back ported by the upstream community. In fact, this is one of the, part of the reasons why those changes are, are happening in the, in the Linux project. So what are we doing about this for Amazon Linux? So if you are running the like AL 2 AL 2023 with the 6.1 kernel, as we, as we released 23, 2 years ago. It doesn't change anything, right? We are going to keep maintaining the 6.1 kernel until the, the end of support date for Amazon Index 2023. So, as long as we support AL 2023, we are going to keep maintaining the 6.1 kernel. And you, we can, you can, you will be able to keep launching those armies tag with the 6.1 kernel for that period of time as well. Uh, if you are choosing, if you are adopting or you're moving on to newer kernels that we released, that's where you need to pay attention here. So we, earlier this year, we released a 6.12 kernel. Uh, that's our new US LTS branch, uh, for our meta Liu. And starting with the 6.12 kernel, we are going to be maintaining future kernels that are meta Linux for a period of four years, uh, as opposed to maintaining them for the full, full duration, full support period of the opening system. So, 4 years is still 2 years more than what we get from the upstream community. So we are doing this to make sure that like you, so those of you who require a specific kernel can keep running them with some level of stability. Um, we also want to give time for, um, like, kind of compliance tools to catch up and like scanners to catch up. We want to like think about like the delays for like certifications and so on. So, 4 years, I felt like a, a pretty, uh, a good balance, and from the feedback we've gotten with customers like this was, this seemed to be hitting the right point. And if you are running the math in your head, like as I'm talking, like you'll realize, you probably already realized that as we, as we move forward and as we release future versions of Amazon Lindex, right, 4 year life, lifetime for the Linux kernel isn't going to give you a stable kernel for the full lifetime of future versions of Amazon Liex. And so, in fact, you should expect that as you, as you adopt future versions of Amazon Liex past TL 2023. That you will have to plan for at least one kernel upgrade, um, along this path. We are hoping that by doing this, like we all make, we, we're going to make like migrations and updates like simpler. And he will tell you some specific plans that we have, uh, moving forward, uh, as we, in order to help this transition from one OS to the next and maintain stability with the, the Linux kernel. Pardon me. So, we, in parallel to this, right, we have introduced new SSM parameters to target the the Linux kernel for Amazon Linux 2023. And so, uh, if you're not familiar with SSM parameters, this is all we recommend that customers pick which Amazon Linux armies that they are going to launch, right? So, you should always Customers always want to launch the latest version of the army that have been released, right? They want customers want to launch the, an army that has already been patched and has no pending security issues. And so, by tagging, by using the SSM parameters in your auto scanning groups configuration, then you can make sure that you always have the latest army that we have published. And so, when we launched L23, we, we, we tagged the Linux version, we encoded the kernel version in those SSM parameters. So as you launch this the Amazon Linux 2023 armies, you are actually launching Amazon Linux 2023 with the 6.1 kernel. And so, when we released the 612 kernel earlier this week, we did this earlier this year, we did the same thing. So we created new SSM parameters with Amazon Unex 2023. uh encoded with the 612 kernel, so that you can select which kernel you want to, you want your own sensors to launch with. Um, what is new this year is that we have also introduced new SM parameters with a default kernel tag. And we are doing this because we, by talking to customers, we realized that most customers don't care or don't need to care about which kernel they are actually running. All they want is a working kernel on the Amazon Lindex instance. So, for those customers that don't have like very specific like requirements, and they don't, they don't, don't pay close attention to the performance profile on their, on their instances, uh, we recommend that they move to the kernel default Scentimeter. And so, in those cases, if you were to launch this army this week, right, you will get the 6.1 kernel. Um, a few weeks or a few months from now, like you will transparently get migrated to the 612 kernel, and in the future as we release new LTS kernel from Amazon Linux, you are going to like get those new kernel versions, um, as well. So we are hoping that this is going to make it easier to keep up with new kernels and by migrating to new kernels, we believe that you are reducing your exposures to potential regressions, uh, that come from backporting patches to kernel as they become, as they become older. Of course, if you are taking this route, like we expect that you will keep using Amazon Index uh uh predictable updates to make sure that you, you are able to properly test, right, between kernel version, between Between different weeks, right, of our releases, and that you are able to like roll back or, or lock on the previous version while uh we stabilize uh bugs or issues that you will have reported. Another key topic that comes up in conversation with customers is compliance, as he intend to a few, a few moments ago. Um, many, we know that many of our customers run an environment where they are like, like strict compliance requirements that have to be met. And some of those, some of those requirements like some of those second requirements like uh, uh, like FIPS, uh, as well as uh other uh related, related requirements of like the US federal government. So a common topic with customers is, how can you make it easier for us to operate in those environments with very strict, uh, compliance criterias. So if you If you need FIPS today in your, in your in your environment, like you probably know already what it is, right? Uh, for those who don't, like I will, I don't want this to derail into uh talk about FIPS, which is a fairly complex space, but basically the short version is that like FIPS is a set of, of policies and a set of standards, uh, that regulates, uh, workloads for the US government as well as the Canadian government and some highly regulated industries. Um, in regard to Linux, the most relevant of those is PIPS 140. PS 140 specifies which cryptographic algorithms, right, can be used and how they can be used in environment are covered by PIPS validation, PIP certification. So, customers that required FIPs with Amazon Index, uh, were previously limited to either running Amazon Linux 2, or were limited to using Amazon Liex 2023 uh under special approval, uh, while the AL 23 cryptographic modules were still under test, uh, on by the, the FIP standards. Earlier this year, Amazon Linux 2023, got the final PIs validation for, um, most from, for all of our cryptographic modules. And so we got final validation for like OpenSSL, the kernel, NSS, new TLS, and Libg crypt. And what this changes for you is that if you need to run Amazon Linu in environment where cryps is required, you can now do so confidently, right, by launching any of the default, uh, Amazon Linu armies. And you have the choice to either enforce tips as you, uh, as you launch and sensors by, uh, changing your kernel command line. And enforcing FIS mode, or you can do so by turning it in, turning it on, on the, on the user space configuration of your various uh applications. Of course, this comes with some caveats, and we, I mentioned, I specifically avoid mentioning like versions of OpenSL and kernel in my previous couple of sentences, uh, but the versions that were firsts validated or the version that we released Amazon Linux with a few years ago, uh, newer version of the kernel like the 612 kernel are not yet validated. They are still undergoing testing. Uh, but this process is ongoing, and the similarly OpenSL 3.2 that we released, uh, earlier this week is also undergoing, uh, revalidation. Moving forward, as we have committed previously, we are going to keep rerunning revalidation of Amazon UX 2023 as we make updates and as we make like feature updates, but also security updates to make sure that if you have like strict requirements to run the specific versions that were first validated. That you can do so that you can catch up to the current state of Amazon Index uh over months and years. The other compliance kind of topic that has, has often come up with customers is um uh the these are stakes, right. So, these are stakes are a set of Required configuration that needs to be applied to your, your instances and your workload, uh, mostly in the like kind of defense within industry, but are also adopted by other, other groups, other industries, uh, that have strict, uh, compliance requirements. So, we, we partnered, AWS partnered with DSA to develop the Amazon UX 2023, uh, DISA stig. This was, this is very fresh. It was released, I think, back in September, so only, only a few weeks ago. Uh, so now, from now on, if you require, if you operate in an environment that have requirements for DSA tigs, uh, configuration, uh, you can follow this document and apply all of those configurations to Amazon Lindex 2023 and ensor to make sure that they conform to the specifications. Um, of course, like nobody likes to manually configure and sensors and or you will have to apply all of those updates to your configuration management, um, software. So that's, uh, a bit of a hassle. So, and to avoid this, we partnered with two key AWS services to automate the DSAt configuration on your behalf. So, if you are using EC2 image builder, you, you can now, uh, toggle the DSAt, uh, configuration, disast documents for Max 1.3. As part of your image build. And so if you do so, it will ensure that every image that you build with the two image builder, uh, are going to come right out of the box, uh, preconfigured for the ML Linux 123 this thing, and that will ensure that the resulting sensors are also going to be properly configured. Uh, similarly, if you use, uh, uh, Amazon Linux, uh, AWS System Manager to configure your running instances, uh, the AWS System Manager have released a managed document for Amazonex 123 DSA Stig that you can also apply on your runningensors or on your new instances as they launch to make sure that you get, uh, conformance to the DSAtig format Liex 1.3 out of the box without manual work on your part. Hopefully this is useful to some of you. Another interesting development that we did in the, in the last year, is the, is work on OpenSSL performance improvements. So when we released Amazon Index 2023, uh, back in March of 2023, we released it with OpenSL 3.0. And what we, some of the feedback we got like fairly early on by customers is that some of you noticed like performance differences between Amazon Unix 2 and Amazon 2023. And some of you pointed to very specific performance degradation. As we, as you transition from using Amazon Linux 2 with OpenSL 102 to using Amazon Liex 2023 with OpenSL 3.0. Those, those, it turns out that those performance differences were, were pretty standard across the industry. Uh, they were seen on all of the Linux distribution that were early adopters of OpenSL 2.0. There were good reasons to adopt OpenSL 2.0 at the time. OpenSL 2.0 comes with a ton of new functional. Uh, functionalities that make it easier to operate services. Uh, it does much better at backward compatibility, and it provides much cleaner, uh, API and much better separation between the APIs and data structures to, so it makes life much easier for application developers. But it was a major rewrite of OpenSSL. And so it, it, it caused, uh, it came with a lot of growing pain that we only realized like after, after it started to be more widely adopted. So the upstream community has worked through those issues. There's been a lot of, a lot of work in, in recent versions of OpenSL to try to cover the gap there. And so, earlier this year, this year with Amazon Lindex 123.7, 1 of our quarterly release version, we have released OpenSL 3.2. And the data that we've gotten from our internal benchmark as well as customers, show that OpenSL 3.2 and Amazonx 1.3. Covers most of the performance gaps, if not all of the performance gaps that were uh that were present with OpenSL 2.0. And we, we are back to the performance level that you will have seen on the AL2A with OpenSL 102. So, in fact, like synthetic benchmarks that we run showed improvements up to 15 times faster with OpenSL 2.2 than we have seen with OpenSSL 3.0. And of course, like we all know that synthetic benchmarks only means so much. So, data from customers, as well as for, as well as for our from our internal teams, uh, running TLS workloads, I've shown like up to real world, 2 to 3 times, uh, performance improvement in the establishment of TLS sessions. That's, uh, that's fairly significant, right? And for some of you, it can result in, uh, like, not only performance improvement, but, but cost saving, as we've been told by customers that they had to like upgrade instance types that they were using in order to keep up with the, the, the volume of requests that they had to process on each of their instances or to scale up their fleet. And so, we think that this is going to, to, to solve this problem for you. And another separate thing that we did at the same time as we upgraded OpenSL versions is that we separated the 5th provider, the 5th modules of OpenSSL out in its own package, right? Meaning that if you have strict requirement to run the PIPS provider that were validated to the PIPS certification validation of VL 2023, you can do so by installing this specific this specific package independently from the OpenSL version that we ship on the base army. So even through our army ship the latest OpenSL version, you can keep installing the PIPS module that were originally validated by installing the separate PIPS provider. And we are going to keep doing so as we keep evolving uh OpenSSL. And as we revalidate, uh, Amazon Linux 2023 for PIPS, uh, we are going to uh to upgrade the version of the PIPS provider as well to catch up to the OpenSL version that we ship in the or base armies. Graphical desktop is another thing that we did this year. And so it turns out that some customers came to us and, and Customers don't all run their workloads on Eitu, or customers don't all run their workload in kind of server types of environments. And so we learned from you that like there's some of our requirements out there for like graphical desktop requirements for maybe you are testing graphical application at scale, or maybe you have specific application that your system operators uh have to run in a graphical environment. That's an interesting development because this is, I remember sitting in meetings as we, as we were designing what will become Amazon X 2023 several years ago and where we took the decision that like we're not going to do a graphical desktop, right? We, we didn't think this was required. We run, we build a distro for the cloud, we build a distro distro for E2. So we thought like, We're going to keep the operating system kind of simpler, and we are going to like kind of constrain the dependencies that have to be brought in. And so we didn't do a graphical desktop and we learned from customers that You know better, right? You know, you know your requirements better than we know them ourselves. And so, we went back to the drawing board, the drawing board, and adapted ML Linux to include a new graphical desktop. So, there's, there's nothing special about it, which is the good news, right? It's, uh, it's based on Gnome. It does everything you will expect from a graphical desktop. You can use a mouse, move the pointer around, and you can browse the internet and all of its colorful glory. Um, the like specific work that you that that we did is we work really hard to try to keep the dependency tree of this graphical desktop as small as possible. We work to try to keep some repeat offender applications that drag in like critical and important CVs on a regular basis out of the dependency tree, so that we, we don't bring those on your, on your instances. And we partnered with the Amazon DCV team, uh, to make sure that you are a secure, a secure mechanism to use for remote access to your systems running the graphical desktop. Looking at the download data that we have, like looking at our download logs from the graphical desktop package, it turns out that some of the packages that we had to bring in for the graphical desktop seem to be more popular than the graphical desktop itself. And so, if you, if you are, if you have been using the like video codecs that we released as part of the graphical desktop uh update. Uh, I would very much like to learn from you what you are doing with them and better understand your, your usage and your requirements so that we can better support those in the, in the future. But it turns out that more people seem to be downloading our video codecs than they are downloading the actual desktop itself, uh, which makes me very curious about, uh, what you are all doing. And I would like to learn more. So, customers have also told us over the past several years that running Running Amazon Linux and or easy to accelerated instance types is, is sometimes harder than it should. Um, it's, it's been, it's been difficult to select, to understand. So, as I launch this instance type, uh, which are the best, which are the best like NvidDR software stack that I should be running on my easy to accelerated instance. Um, There, there's been a kind of a disconnect between our documentation and the document, the documentation of like the vendor and VDR here on the hardware. And we've wanted to make the, make it easier for you to make sure that you run the right software on your stands to get the best performances. So, In the last year, we have released Amazon Linux 2023 Nvidia repositories. So this is not the original package that we built ourselves. We are taking the, the RPMs that NvidiaVD make available on the website, and you may be asking yourself like, so why, why will I be using those instead of getting them directly from Nvidia. So the the difference with our repositories is that we have partnered with the EC2 platform teams that build the accelerated platforms that you might be using. And we work with them to qualify every update that Nvidia puts out. And so, every new RPM of the drivers and the CUDA software stack that Nvidia releases, right, we put through our automation automated pipeline. And we validate them for regression, and we make sure that they, they meet the right level of performance that we expect out of those instances. And only then are those packages moved to the Amazon X 2023 and media repositories. And so we are doing, we did this to make sure that you add a mechanism to which you could ensure that you are running a version of the, the software that has been properly tested on the EC2 platforms, and that, uh, that produce the best performance that we can get out of those instances. Uh, we've also added security metadata to those repositories because as your AI workloads transition from like fast experimentation to like production systems, and as compliance, like an auditors catch up to what you, what we have all been doing there, we want to make sure that you have mechanisms in place to make, to, to report and verify that you are running the latest versions and that you have applied all of the security patches um on your systems. So, every time that Nvidia releases new versions that cover, that, that covers CVs and like fix pending CV issues that they have discovered in the software, we also produce 6 advisories for all Nvidia repositories, so that you can, your automation and your scanners can pick them up and make sure to report the correct states for your systems. And of course, those repositories are replicated across all the regions and all EZs so that you don't have to reach out to the public internet or do cross-region access in order, uh, in order to get your packages, and that you get, uh, a low latency access to our res repositories wherever your instances are running. So, if you want to look at a bit more into this, you can easily enable those repositories on your instances with a simple Uh, DNF command to install the Nvidia release package that will apply the configuration for the repositories, and from that point on, you can follow Nvidia documentation to install all the packages that your workloads may need. And so last but not least, right, a few weeks ago, we released the supplementary packages for Amazon Linux. That's a bit of a, of a mouthful, so we, we came up with the school EPA acronym to refer to them. Uh, we did this in response to customers telling us that as you migrated from AL2 to AL 2023, a lot of you were rely previously relying on packages coming out of the EPL repositories, the federal EPL repositories. And uh, as we released AL 2023, that the fact that you could not find those packages in Amazonex core repositories was making it harder for you to migrate VON sensors from AL2 to AL 2023. And so, if this is the case, right, so we released a few weeks ago, we released the EPA repositories. Uh, we did this in collaboration with Susa. So we partnered with SSA to rebuild packages from the EPL 9 repositories and rebuild them for Amazon Linux 2023. Uh, they came out with a few 1000 packages. We are going to keep increasing this. This is a kind of a living project. And we are going to keep building in new packages in those repositories over the next couple of weeks and months. We hope that this is going to make it easier for for customers who are still on the L2 and we have been kind of blocked on some package availability to transition to AL 20223. Of course, this repositivity comes with a couple of caveats that I need to, to warn you about, right? We We do not support those packages to the same level that we support packages and the core repositories. So we are going to our commitment to the SAR repositories that any update to those packages that is made in the, kind of the upstream federal project are going to be brought back into the Amazon as power repositories, but we're not planning at this time to make kind of original updates that are, uh, that independently from the federal project, uh, in those repositories. And we are currently not publishing secret advisories for the SPAL project, uh, either. So this is, this is a bit of like use at your own risk, uh, model, but we're committed to making this work with Amazon Index 2023, uh, moving forward. Uh, I can start er er enumerating a long list of packages, but I encourage you to kind of hit our documentation to see all of the packages that, uh, have currently been published. And as new packages are added, this is going to be updated. So we had a lot of things happening this year, right? I think the, the key things that I really want you to remember are changes to the current life cycle, right, this is, this is super important, and this is true for 2023, but this is going to be true moving forward. And so we're really trying to adapt with what's happening in the upstream community here and making sure that we, we deliver you kind of sustainable, uh, kernel updates, uh, changes to compliance, like if you care about this, you already know. So, like, like pay attention. OpenSN improvements have been a, a huge update this year. Uh, we are going to try, we are going to keep, uh, updating versions, uh, as time goes on to get you the best performances out of Amazontics 2023 on DC2. And of course, like we released a ton of new packages through SPAL, uh, I think that's happened like two weeks ago. So this is all very exciting and still, still like living project. So on that, I'm going to end the mic back to Ski, who's going to talk to you about what's happening with TL2. Thank you Fred. And before we move uh and talk about what's happening with Amazon Linux, this next version, let's talk about AI 2. Hey, um, are your workloads still on Amazon Linux 2? Because a quick reminder that AL2 or Amazon Linux 2 is upcoming its end of support on June 30, 2026. So approximately six months from now, AL2 will reach its end of support. We encourage all our customers to get off of AL2 before the end of support, upgrade to the latest version of Amazon Linux, which is AL 2023. Let us talk a little bit about what happens. Or after, uh, June 30th, 2026, so on July 1st, what will happen? While you'll still have access to the AL-2 repositories, and if you're still using, uh, AL2 instances or AL2 armies, you'll be able to use that, you can continue to use that. However, AWS uh will not provide security patches, bug fixes, or AWS support in a regular fashion. That's why we encourage all our customers, if you have not already planned your migrations, please plan your migrations, test them, and move off of AL2 before the end of support date. OK, let's switch gears and uh talk about the future. What's coming up next with the Amazon Linux? So in this session you heard about the AL2 end of support timelines, we just talked about it now, and Frederick talked about the AL 2023 new features. What I'm excited to share with you all is that we have started working on the next version of Amazon Linux, and as you can see on the screen, it is gonna be coming up in 2027. So before I give a little bit more details about what AL uh the next version of Amazon Linux looks like, um, let me give you a little bit of context. So as our customers were migrating from AL2 to AL 2023, we heard a lot of feedback from our customers and we've categorized them into four different buckets. First one is continuity and predictability. What you and our customers mentioned is that you appreciate AWS uh integrations with various other AWS services, uh, you appreciate that we are able to provide a secure and a stable OS which is obviously the fundamental components to any OS, so you would like us to continue doing that. And also provide predictability. Uh, give you a certain time, uh, time about, uh, when will an end of support come up or when will the new version of the OS come up. This will help you plan your migrations, your upgrades. So this is what we heard from our customers. Second is, as customers were migrating from one major version to another, in this case AL2 to AL 2023, many of you mentioned that. Can you make these OS upgrades easier? So this was uh something that a lot of our customers mentioned. Third one is, uh, customers in our regulatory industries, uh, like healthcare, finance, and government agencies, uh, wanted us to provide PIPs, uh, availability as soon as possible so that they can, uh, migrate over to the new version of the OS as soon as possible. Last but not the least, uh, we heard from our customers that you want to work with us, you want to provide feedback, you want to be able to see a preview of what's coming up with the next version. So what this feedback translated to is, uh, forming the pillars for the next version of Amazon Linux. So firstly, we, we, the next version of Amazon Linux will be evolving from AL 2023. Uh, it'll be built on the success of it and we will continue to maintain all the seamless integrations that we have with AWS services today. Second is security. You heard a lot about security in terms of CV fixes, um, uh, and, uh, the, the, uh, the kernel changes, etc. from, uh, Frederick earlier. So we'll continue to provide those, uh, secure, um, updates. But in addition to that, we are thinking of, um, providing the automated kernel version updates, uh, by default. So, uh, you heard about the rolling kernel versions. So that is what we will, uh, provide in the next version of Amazon Linux. The third one is easy upgrades. So, uh, one is by providing early access, uh, or the preview access, you are able to understand what is coming up in the next version of, uh, Amazon Linux. Uh, it'll also help you plan your upgrades better. Second, we will enhance our documentation, our best practices, uh, to help, uh, migrations much easier. And lastly, we're also thinking about overlapping kernel versions. So for example, um, say AL 2023 will have a kernel version at 6.18. Uh, we'll make sure that the same kernel version is also available in the next version of Amazon Linux so that when you migrate it, it becomes much easier. Last but not the least is we know our customers are investing heavily in AI workloads. Now the role of an OS in this is to be able to support uh these workloads, uh, AIML workloads, and we can do so by providing the right drivers, uh, for example, and so the next version of Amazon Linux will support, uh, the, uh, will support and provide foundations for these AI and ML workloads. So we understand uh from you and our customers about the predictability and all the other feedback that you've provided. So when we are ready to announce the next version of Amazon Linux, we will provide a 12 month advance notice, uh, so watch out for our announcement on the Amazon Linux product pages. Um, and in addition to that, we're looking for feedback from you. We wanna hear from you and understand what really matters. So the QR code on the bottom right here, uh, actually takes you to the GitHub. So, uh, when you go there, create an issue of feature request and provide your feedback there. We will definitely take that into consideration. So with that, I would like to wrap up the session with 3 key takeaways. First is that AL2 or Amazon Linux 2 end of support is upcoming on June 30, 2026. So we request our customers, if you have not already planned your migrations, please plan it and move off of AL2 before the end of support date. Uh, we are continuing to innovate on Amazon Linux. You heard a lot of new features on AL 2023. And as you're, um, migrating from AL2 to AL 2023, and if you have dependencies on Apple packages, make sure to check out SPA. It's, it's a new feature that we just launched, and it can help you migrate easily. You don't have to build these packages from source. Um, familiarize yourself with the kernel changes that's happening. And if you are um a regulatory customer and you need PIPs or diesel stig, please make sure to check that out too. Lastly, uh, Amazon Linux next is upcoming, so, uh, please watch out for the product pages for any future announcements, as well as provide feedback on GitHub and uh we'd love to hear from you. So with that I thank you all for attending this session and please remember to uh fill out the session survey in the mobile app and uh thank you again. If you have any questions just uh come talk to us. Thank you so much.
