Hey everyone, um, first of all, very happy to be here to talk about, uh, how we help our customers modernizing credit risk application and um. Make the best out of solving concrete problems using agentic AI in this case, um, so I will talk a lot about finance. Why is this happening? Why we need AI agents in order to solve some of the credit risk challenges that banks are facing, particularly for business banking. Uh, first, you know, who am I? I'm Adrian. I'm a global director of AI solution for uh Cloudera. So what do I do? I help our customers around Cloudera, Cloudera AI to make use of the platform and to solve the right use case with the, the right solution. organization. So you know, uh, first, banking, you know, banking is the most impacted by GI. That's quite clear. I think according to McKinsey, we are looking at the $340 billion potential value creation thanks to a generative AI, but it's not that we are looking at $340 billion that is going to happen overnight, right? There's still a lot of challenges that we see on this. The first one, you know, is integration in existing process. If you look at the bank. A lot of legacy, a lot of systems that have been here for years, um, and you need to make sure that the system can get connected to an AI system. When you look at, um, training the people. Entire processes were revolving around manual processes, human driven, um, and you have to rethink them on how do you move this process to become AI driven. We human control, which is a very different taxonomy, it's not just like sprinkling some AI on top of a process and hoping something would happen. And you look a common topic for banking, safety, guard rails. How do you ensure that the process is still safe and that you are not sending your credit data to the wrong person or the wrong actors, right? But first let's get back to Cloudera. So Cloudera, we are an AI and data platform. We try to, uh, we claim that we can do, you know, from your data ingestion all the way to your AI on one platform with a single control plane with a single security layer. We were completely hybrid. Obviously our preferred partner is on AWS. That's where most of our customers are using them when they are on cloud. Can also do it on premise, so we try to really be a bridge between the two for customers who might want, you know, to do a zero code refactoring, move to the cloud. They can obviously do it. We provide a unified data fabric. What does it mean? It means that for all your applications from the ingestion all the way to your AI, you are managed with a single security schema. You don't need to reproduce some like security rule somewhere else and then you realize that your. Uh, access policy do not match, then you get 25 audit findings and your bonus decline at the end. I was head of AI for a bank, and I know that when you get too many audit findings, the bonus goes down. There's a, there was a rule like this. I discovered it the hard way at some point. Um, we provide the open data lake house obviously as a foundation to AI application, but also to reporting and any kind of more traditional things you want to do with your AI with your lake house. But today. We'll focus a lot more on the application layer. Why? Because obviously we have a big shift towards AI that banks, financial institutions, the largest, particularly in the US, have been investing heavily on data like ours, and now it's money time, you know, make this data to use and be able to uh build application, refactor application, um, and get some business impact leveraging AI. We do this, we do this even more on the advantage of Cloudera, which is private AI, and private area obviously is very convenient for us in a financial service industry. Financial service industry meaning we are able to provide this within your own VPC. Whether it's on cloud, whether it's on prem, everything remains within a single environment, so you can deploy models whether it's an LLM or a credit risk model in the same cloud estate if you want, uh, which is really something that our clients appreciate on it. Uh, we do value a lot of open source, so most of our stock is open source. Why? No vendor lock in? I always say if you don't like us, you can take the code and go on open source if you want, which is, I think, a testimony on the value we generate. Clients are willing to pay for us not because they are locked in, but because we do provide them a lot of value. And the last part, you know, is hybrid, like I say, on cloud, on prem, you can use the estate as much as you want. And deploy the code wherever you would like to have. OK, let's get back to our applications. You know, AI, when I talk to customers, they tell us, you know, we do see a lot of potential value. The potential value is 50% improvement in the process and particularly for business banking, commercial banking. Why is that? Because if you look at the landscape of credit origination for mortgages. In most countries it's heavily automatized. Even in the US, you know, you have a credit bureau, you get a score, you have almost not perfect but close to perfect information. So automation is always there. The real pain point for banks, and when I asked some of them what is the You know how much time do you spend more? They tell us SMEs is where we spend a lot more time, and that's why the spreads for SMEs are very high because operational costs are high and it's also difficult for them to get good insight on what's happening. Why? Because when you are an SMEs sometimes you don't get audited. The audit report is very different from one company to another. They work in very small businesses, so you really have a tremendous opportunity there. But you know, in an ideal world we don't need this. In a in a nice world we have perfect information, perfect trust, and perfect decisions. What does it mean? It means that we have great data coming from great P&L statements that are uniform and everything. That's what you see on large corporations. That's not what you see on smaller enterprise. You have perfect trust when a company gives you a document, you know this document is trustworthy. Obviously that's not true, especially when you start looking at international lending and other, let's say, less well known. Enterprise And you have perfect decision, given the information that you have. You can make a decision that you know with certainty what is the risk you are taking on this loan. Meaning your credit risk model should be working fine, right? That's obviously not the case, right? We do have a lot more friction that are remaining when you look at a loan origination process. You go from an application, uh, verification, underwriting at some point, and then maybe some approval if it's good. Here, what do you, what do you see us? Key blockers where you see quite a lot, right? Documents, many of them are going to be physical. Especially when it's an audited statement, you still find them with a stamp, and even if it's a DocuSign, it does not help much more, right? Uh, you have policies inside the bank, so the policy against which you're supposed to match. The credit application this policy, what is it? It was written by human for human, it's not written by an AI it's not readily enforceable and then later on, you know, you'll see component monitoring and others. So you have obviously a heavy human intervention in this particular processes whether it's application, collecting the document, then saying hey you're missing this file. Um, making a decision. Yes, there are machine learning models that are making decisions, but if you look at the machine learning models for enterprise and small and medium enterprise. The human input and the expert inputs, how they call it, is still quite heavy, right? So that's why we do see that there's still quite a lot of opportunities, and the opportunities, you know, are numerous. First of all, an AI powered origination. Can you make the document review more seamless? Can you review a credit memo and states against this policy? This credit memo seems too much, or hey, there are some deviations. Here are the deviations. Please go reach an approval for a certain by a certain authority. It could be a chief risk officer. It could be just a director, compliance, anyone, right? And the last one is obviously AI powered loan management. We do see some banks now doing automated call collection. I was working at a bank before in Asia and instead of having people calling for loan connection, they put a chatbot to it and if the chatbot managed to reach out the person that is being passed to a loan processor. So maybe, and in the US I know some of you might be receiving some calls that are automated from the banks in order to try to get you to pay back the loans. And then later on, you know, we can also have AI power loan management, yeah, risk review, and risk review is something that is very simple yet very complicated for enterprise. It's any new information may lead to a risk review. Think about it like this. Tomorrow a board member of this enterprise is changing. What are the implications from a risk standpoint for this particular credit? Might be nothing, but if you have to do it manually, you have to research oh this person is on the board. What is the name screening for this person, what is the new uh risk scoring that we see, and so on and so forth, right? So it might not be straightforward. For today we're going to focus a lot more on, OK, I have a policy. I have a credit memo. How do we know that this policy and this credit memo are matching, and we do have some customers really actively investing a lot on this. Why? Because that's a very large bottleneck on it. So we have a credit risk policy written by human for human, might be a mortgage policy. It might be an enterprise policy. We have a risk memo and basically the create policy is going to state, OK, your loan to value must be. 80%. Does this credit proposal fulfill this, or do we need an escalation process? That's a process that can take. That can take really a lot of time and leads to loan being postponed and not being approved in time. So we're going to have a demo where we create an agent per rules in the policy, and then this agent can be matched against the credit memo that can be seen as a credit application from an enterprise. Um, before that, you know, the process that we have chosen for this, that we will have a creation for each agent by reading the policy and AI system can understand what are the right agents to extract and what are the right agents to create so that you get a list of in this example having a couple of 100 of agents, then we can select it. The selection in the example is still manual, can be automated. We do it manually because. You know, still some human intervention. You don't want to apply the wrong rule to the wrong memo, then you get obviously a wrong output then the execution and the monitoring, um, it's really going to look like this. We're trying to bring together a bank process, a bank policy, and also the people in the bank as like human in the loop, uh, layer and even in the future try to bring in the machine learning model. That's just the technical slide that I have to put. How did we build it? Um, so I built it leveraging a couple of other tech technology, some open source, some of our partners. Everything runs on cloudera. Neo 4G has a graph database in order to bring better, you know, relationship between various agents. I did find that it improves heavily the extraction of agents to have a graph database on it. Uh, also use Dockling as a document processor for this particular use case. There's other technologies that are possible, um, but overall, you know, we're gonna extract, find the agent, assess what are the requirements, and then put it in a, in a graph database. And when we want to evaluate the credit proposal, we retrieve these agents, assess whether the conditions are satisfied. And then get a final memo on it. This started when I need to tick. Alright, so this is the Cloudera, um, Clouderra AI workbench where we have deployed an application that is meant exactly, exactly for this. First step, you know, is we're going to, uh, select a credit policy, and the credit policy is one that I made up based on, based on another bank's policy, but I can't use, uh, exactly their own, uh, their own policy, obviously. So it's a fairly standard one, where you have some threshold that needs to be met. And a lot of rules in it that's very typical of what you can find can find in a bank. We'll upload it, trigger the first analysis pipeline which is going to retrieve a set of agents. The set of agents are converted into some some JSN file, but first we can obviously select them, so you will see. One example is, you know, the credit report age limit here. It just states that the application must be as recent as 30 days, just a very basic rule. We can also have automated selection. I implemented it so that I don't need to bother thinking, oh, I need to trigger this one, this one, this one, get this agent to run this agent to run, and AI will decide which agents are relevant for this particular credit application. Then I upload um a mortgage application in this case with everything you expect from a mortgage application, income and um other other topics. Um, the policy was extracted and some graph, uh, knowledge graph was built, and this does help a lot in, um, bringing, let's say a relationship between various rules so that you can get all the mortgage rules together. We also provide observability through another partner called Galileo and in this case you know it does provide insight on what's going on on the agent that we are we are running just a basic observability observatory tool. If we go back to our to our application. Um, so it should be finishing, I hope. OK. So it does give us an overall compliance compliance score. So in this case, you know, the credit report age limit was selected. They say it is fine. The credit report is 3 days old, so most likely this particular agenttic rule that we define is actually OK. The bank statement age limit is fine. does tell us that the minimum down payment for first time buyer is actually correct. I think in this case the down payment is at 9% and the credit policy was at 3%, so it's able to make some computation. This was not given in the application memo. The application memo we stated this is the down payment. This is the loan amount, and therefore that's how it works. We use our partner one more time, Galileo, in order to assess what's going on. And whether everything run properly, um, so we're able to log log every single steps straight from Cloudera AI in order to uh look what is the execution. In this case it's a workflow, so it goes from left to right, uh, in a, in a fairly smooth manner and we're able to, you know, debug and something happened. Was this the right agent to pick? Was it executed properly, or does it need to be rerun uh at some point? That's something quite useful in order to to avoid to show there's some cost management in case we are using some. Uh, in case we are using some other, other thing. That's all for me. So I think I've been showing, you know, on Clouder AI and leveraging some of our great partners on AWS how we can modernize credit application. It's not just theoretical on a demo. I actually implemented this for one of our customers. In order to double check what humans were doing, let's be realistic. urgency care is still at the infancy. And there's more like there's still a lot of duplicate checks that needs to be done, but there's actually a bank using this in order to um in order to check whether some potential audit issue are happening inside. Uh, Inside the credit risk origination process, so I think it's generating great value, and if you want to know more, please visit us at our booth 1175 right over there. Uh, we'll be very happy to discuss more about it. Thank you very much.
