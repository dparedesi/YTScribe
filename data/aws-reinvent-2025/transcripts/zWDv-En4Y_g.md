OK, everybody, we're gonna go ahead and get started. So if you're on the outskirts, come on into the inskirts. Uh, we're gonna be talking about using Amazon Nova Act to simplify login workflows. Please put your hands together, give a warm welcome to your speakers, Anand Srinivas and Flores van der Gritzen. Hey, what's up folks? Uh, first off, we're super excited. Thank you very much for coming in and we're super excited to be talking about being a Nova Act launch partner and using Amazon Nova Act to simplify login workflows. And uh my name is Anand Srinivas. I'm the VP of product and AI here at OnePassword, and I'm here with Flores Vandergrant who's a senior developer at and the developer at AI at OnePassword as well. Perfect. So the thing I want to get started with is one password. Um, we're pretty well known for our security model. There's actually a 70 page white paper out there if anyone wants some bedtime reading about exactly how that works, and we recently updated that security model for Agentic AI. And what what we think is important and so I just wanna go through a couple of these uh that are that are key here. The first is this idea that secrets stay secret. We have a very strict zero knowledge model where any system hosted by one password cannot decrypt your credentials, and that's the model that we intend to keep with Agenic AI as well. Um, the 2nd and 3rd here, uh, authorization should be deterministic, not probabilistic, and that raw credentials should never enter into a model's context. Uh, those have to do with things like MCP. So for instance, sending raw credentials down the MCP channel is probably not best practice, right? Is, is how we, how we look at that. And so we look for deterministic workflows to transfer credentials in that way. And then the rest of the principles are all around transparency, auditability, and other aspects of it. So overall at one password, the way we look at AI in general is there's a component of this which is using AI within our products and so we we might call that AI for security and actually Florists will be covering that later on today, and that's exactly how we use the Nova Act models to make the one password product better, right, so he'll cover that. The other side of this is security for AI, which is using one password's products to help secure agentic AI as they are deployed. And so that's the part I'm gonna talk about a little bit before I hand off to Florists. But before I do, what I wanna sort of talk about a little bit is, is a sort of taxonomy that will make this discussion a little bit more clear and useful, hopefully. Um, so the way we look at AI or Agentic AI in particular is on the vertical axis of this. We classify it into two broad categories. The first is agentic AIs that interact with other applications and services by clicking around in a web browser or more generally computer use, right? They're mimicking a person in terms of like that interaction. The other type of agentic AI uses programmatic means, so think MCP APIs, other kinds of standard approaches that way. Um, and then on the horizontal axis at the top is where these agentic AI's are deployed. Are they deployed on your device, like on your laptop, or are they in the cloud, right? And so if you look at what this looks like in practice, just some examples, so when a browser use style agentic AI is running on your laptop. Examples of this are things like perplexity or OpenAI's Atlas browser, right? Um, and the use cases here you're just automating something on behalf of yourself, right? Uh, whereas in the remote in in the cloud now we're talking about Nova Act plus something like Agent Core browser tool where the use cases are hey I. Don't wanna have to sit in front of my laptop and run this. I can run this, uh, asynchronously in the clo in the cloud. It can be automation for myself. It can be an internal application for employees, uh, or it can be a production application that that's deployed in the cloud that's deployed on behalf of customers, right? So any of those use cases. The other side of this is programmatic. And so again on your laptop what this looks like is something like cursor right? uh or lovable or cloud desktop, right? And the use cases here are a lot about vibe coding but it's just about automating and making yourself more efficient as well and then the cloud version of this are deployed applications or you know uh applications that are built through agent builders or AI that's embedded in, you know, other applications like Notion for example Notion AI, um, and the use cases here again are very. Similar to the use cases for the cloud applications um for browser use agentic AI as well and so what we're gonna focus on for this talk because it's relevant to Nova Act in particular and our launch partnership with AWS is the first side of this or the top half of this which is around browser use agentic AI but hopefully we'll be back in another day to talk about the programmatic AI stuff as well and how one password can help secure um that side of it as well. So getting into that, um. The first one I wanna talk about is remotely deployed browser use style agentic AI. So think about this as there's a headless browser running in the cloud, right, and there's an LLM that's driving that headless browser, and basically you can prompt that LLM and just let it run asynchronously and obviously for it to be of any value it has to log into things, right? It has to log into different websites, access different services, and so on and so on. So how do we solve that? Problem right of getting those credentials securely filled on behalf of the agentic AI without actually giving those credentials to the agentic AI into the context window and also without you know a person having to pause the thing and manually type it in and remember their password hopefully we've gotten over those kind of problems and so we recently made an announcement we're gonna be making many more announcements with partners on this where our solution is we actually have a one password browser extension running in. Inside the headless browser in the cloud and what we're able to do is when that genic or that LLM wants to access some website it asks that browser extension, hey, I would like to fill in this uh um this website and previously you would have actually connected the service and one password, right? So in this example we made an announcement with a company called Browser Base and so you would beforehand connect Browser Base with one password and sort of that sets it up and. What happens is in the flow the LLM asks the browser extension, can I fill this website? The browser extension asks you, the person, right, it gives you an auth prompt and says, hey, browser-based headless browser is trying to access this particular website and wants your credentials for it. Do you authorize it? And so you would approve that flow and basically the credentials are sent end to end encrypted, right, where they're only. Decrypted inside the browser extension that is actually in that headless browser and so that's the solution that we've come up with here that solves this problem of again filling the credentials on behalf of the agent in a secure encrypted way without exposing the credentials to the agent um and some of the things going forward that we're working on are things like asynchronous workflows, right? So how do you. Set policy right on the fact that OK well maybe I don't want to approve every single credential. There's some low risk ones that can just go through, no problem, right? but maybe some higher risk ones I do want like an explicit human in the loop off prompt and so some of the things like that we're we're working on, but that's an example of um browser use agentic AI in the cloud, how we're securing that. The next part of this is, what about browser use agentic AI that is running on your laptop? How do we secure that? And so here recently we've announced partnerships with Perplexity as well as OpenAI's Atlas browser as well, and we are the, we're launch partners with them and the only security launch partners with them and basically the idea is the one password browser extension can work on these browsers and so it solves at least the problem of again you're not manually typing passwords into these things, right? You're able to fill it from your vault, right? and then going forward what we'll be looking to do is add more automations to this particular workflow as well and so you know hopefully that kind of gives you an idea that at least on the browser use side that's the breadth of how we're looking at sort of how to secure agentic AI and as I said earlier, you know, hopefully we'll be back in the future to talk about the programmatic AI stuff as well. So with that what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna hand off uh to my colleague uh Flores and he's gonna get into how we're actually using the Nova Act models within the One Password product to solve important production use cases. Flores, oh, hi, I'm Flores from the engineering team at OnePassword, and I'm gonna be showing you how um we we're using agentic AI at One password to improve our own product. In a way that just wouldn't be possible in a pre-AI era, and the star of the show here is really Amazon's Nova Act, which launched here at Reinvent, and it's their browser use Agentic AI solution. So let's talk about autofill. Um, one password comes with a browser extension, as you may know, and this adds a small icon in login uh uh form fields, and if you click that icon, you can choose a credential, the credential that you want to use to log in to the website, and then one password does the tedious work of logging in and filling out the form. So that's how it works today, but we're working on the next generation now of Autofill and we're calling it universal sign on and with universal sign on we really wanna take the experience of um logging in from hey one password, fill in this login form for me to a more holistic like hey one password, just log me in, do whatever it takes to log me in. And so regardless of the log in the login method, so whether that's a username password, a TOTP for MFA, Enterprise SSO, a passkey, or a sign in with GitUp or Google, which you probably forgot which one you used for which website again, and so here's how that looks. So I click on the website and it automatically goes to the login page, signs me in, enters the password, enters the TOTP. And I'm logged in with just a single click, hands off the keyboard. Now, so how does this work? Um, unfortunately there's not a standard protocol for logging into websites. It's, it's HTM free for all HTML with lots of ambiguity, and um for classic autofill we have solved, more or less solved the ambiguity with a one size fits all or a one size fits most algorithm that's based on heuristics. Um, and it's, it's, it's been working great and it's being used millions of times per day, uh, by many users, and, but now for universal sign on we're running into the limits of the, the heuristics that we can articulate in our code, um, because now the browser extension, it wouldn't just need to know how to fill in the form, it also needs to know how to navigate to and through the form, which is much more complex to do. So Um, ideally we would have website specific logic here, um, so because every website is different, mm, and to, to make this a success and to realize the universal sign on vision, this is, this is what we're gonna need. The problem is though, as you probably guess, you can probably guess, this doesn't scale if you have to do this by hand, um, because yeah, there are millions of websites out there, uh, that offer a, a, a login. Um, that offer logins and also even if we were to do this, it's gonna be brittle because at the scale would operate on um. We would see braking changes every single day, so that's not really an option, so. No, I wouldn't overact um. We can, we can finally solve this, we can scale this up. So what we've done, we've we've built an AI agent using Nova Act that goes out on the web, browses these websites for us, and it gathers the intelligence that we need, um, around how, how different websites offer logins, um, and the intelligence is then validated by a second agent which also uses Nova Act to validate whether the the information that we get about the login experience is correct. And then it gets fed into what we call the site intelligence engine, and that exposes it to our browser extension, and the browser extension then uses the intelligence to enhance the existing algorithm for for a smooth login experience. And this runs, what's nice about this is that it can run out of band, so it can run in our infrastructure and gather the intelligence and pass that to the browser extension so that the browser extension, the login experience there will just stay blazingly fast and also deterministic. Um, and what's also nice is that we can run the validation agent periodically in the background to see if the intelligence is still correct or not, and if not invalidated. So let's see, let's have a look at how the Nova Act agent does this, so. We're gonna have it browse to the reinvent website and the instructions that we give is find how this website offers login and this is a pretty simple example because there's a big login button on the top right um so it should be able to to find it here. Let's see if yes, clicked it and it's able to find the login form and it knows um this is, this is the login form, so I'm gonna return. If we look at a slightly more complex example, here is the website for Duolingo, and this is a bit more difficult because it doesn't have a traditional login button, it just says it has a button that says I already have an account and to make it a bit more complicated, it's not a standard button with an with an H ref that links to the login button, but it's a JavaScript click handler, um, and this would be. Much more complicated to build it in a heuristic-based algorithm, but for humans it's easy. Humans just click, I already have an account, and because Nova Act uses the same human kind of reasoning, it's still easily able to get to the login page, which is really great. It And along the way, Nova Act also posts uh uh logs every step in the evaluation loop that it takes, and as you can see it it really thinks like a human here, it reasons like a human, so it says uh that it finds a button that says I already have an account which is like which likely links to the login form, um, then it knows, OK, I need to click that and then it actually is able to perform the click. And lastly, it's it it it will evaluate it again and then it it reasons about, hey, this is, this is the logging form, so I'm done with my task. So to recap, website specific intelligence can meaningfully improve the one password products in a way that just wouldn't be possible in a pre-AI era. Um, and we really just only scratch the surface of what Agentic AI can do for our product, but if you want to try it out and get a glimpse of this new universal login experience, you can install the, the beta of the one password extension which already has this, this new UX and um the first data intelligence powered by Amazon Nova Act. So thank you for listening. Sure. We can take some, take some questions, yeah.
