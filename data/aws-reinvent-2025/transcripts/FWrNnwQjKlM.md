  Nissan executives outline their software-defined vehicle (SDV) strategy, emphasize AI as a core enabler, and detail how AWS accelerates the company’s new scalable, open software platform. Nissan views SDV as a shift from hardware-centric cars to vehicles that evolve via software and data, mirroring a brain that adapts. AI underpins the roadmap: partnering with Wayve to deliver AI-powered vehicles by 2027, building AI agents to personalize journeys, and accelerating software development to respond quickly to changing customer expectations. The SDV business goals focus on upgradable personalization, new recurring revenue streams across the vehicle lifecycle, faster feature velocity, and orchestrating an ecosystem that connects vehicles, customers, and the cloud while protecting safety and performance. Nissan publicly names its platform for the first time: the Nissan Scalable Open Software Platform, built on three pillars—Open SDK for application and service development, Open Data for secure access to vehicle data to drive value, and Open OS, a flexible in-vehicle operating system supporting updates and upgrades. The platform covers vehicle systems, OTA programming, user interface, engineering cloud, and more. Data flows from vehicles into cloud analytics and SDK-driven development, with new apps delivered back over-the-air in a rapid loop.
  AWS Principal SA Kazuo Kajimoto explains the collaboration begun in 2023. AWS supports three pillars: “tools on AWS” (Nissan’s Engineering Cloud) delivering fast CI/CD, global scale, and forming the base for AI agents for developers; “target on AWS” (virtual ECUs and digital twin architectures) leveraging Graviton to run real-time, binary-compatible virtual ECUs across AUTOSAR, RTOS, and Linux, with lightweight container management on Linux; and “data-driven on AWS” providing a vehicle data platform with scalable ingestion, management frameworks, and regional privacy compliance. The engineering cloud features three capabilities: CI process automation that cuts testing time by roughly 75% using HPC, autoscaling, and parallelization; a “workbench portal” that offers global accessibility and one-minute deployments for common and regional environments with Docker-in-Docker-style container packaging via CodeBuild; and lightweight content management using Podman to improve security and resource efficiency, consistent across physical ECUs, virtual ECUs, and development workbenches. Nissan plans to onboard over 5,000 developers and to deploy Podman-based content to vehicles through OTA, forming part of the digital twin strategy.
  Looking forward, Nissan’s SDV roadmap integrates generative AI. The company targets next-generation ProPILOT in 2027, enabling door-to-door driving with AI assistance. AI ecosystems and AI-based software development aim to shorten cycles and continuously deliver features. A vision video shows drivers voicing requests (e.g., automate windows and AC) that cloud-based AI instantly analyzes, then custom software is generated and deployed over-the-air to tailor the vehicle, highlighting a future of customer co-creation. Nissan stresses safety and quality while pursuing rapid innovation, positioning the SDV platform and AWS partnership to meet evolving customer needs with confidence.

It's show time, so we're gonna go ahead and bring out, uh, we're gonna bring out Kazuo and Kazuma for how Nissan accelerates software defined vehicle development with AWS. This is gonna be a great one. Thanks so much for your patience. Come on out, let's go. All righty. Take it away. Hi, good evening everyone. So welcome to Reinvent 2025. Now, I'm super excited to be here to present today's topic. That is how Nissan accelerated software defined vehicle development with AWS. So before jumping uh today's contents, I would like to set the stage and run run you through the agenda. The first one of all, uh, Simonson mentioned about the Nissan SUV strategy and the concept. After that, I will take over. And I mentioned about Nissan SDB uh acceleration with our AWS and finally, Nissan future SDB video, uh, vision with generative AI that is will be revealed. OK. Then it's short time. So now let's see the who is the Nissan and what Nissan is doing now. So. Others don't, is what defines us. Because Hello, I'm Cosmo Sukimoto Romanisa today. I will share Nissan's vision of software defined vehicle. SDB It's not just a new technology. It is a new way of thinking about the vehicle. We aim to create a vehicle. That can Evolve, adapt, and improve over time. Just like a human brain evolves. Let's begin by exploring how Nissan STV strategy. To Will transform our customer experience. Artificial intelligence AI. AI is positioned strategic enabler for our SDB transformation. And also key area of competitiveness in the automotive industry. For example, Our partnership with Wave will bring. AI powered vehicle to customer in 2027. We are building AI agent to communicate with customer. Making Every journey unique. AI helps us develop software faster. We can respond quickly to our customer needs. As technology and customer expectation are always evolving. We at Nissan welcome this change. Lead to way. With Innovation To create The crew Faster, smarter, safer and more personal. Let's look at the construct of Nissan STV focusing on. Key business drivers and core technology enablers to create realized value. To enhance our customers' digital lifestyle. We are focused on. Personalization through upgradability. This will also establish new recurring. Revenue stream for Nissan and value chain player. Across the entire vehicle life cycle. We are orchestrating the ecosystem by connecting vehicle and customer. Where is the crowd. Our goal is to quickly and continuously deliver. Unique driving experience to all of our customers. Tailored to their preference. While ensuring safety. And vehicle performance. From next, I will explain. Our enablers, these will be used by our regional engineer and also open for third parties. special I'm really happy to announce the name of our SDB platform. Nissan scalable open software platform. Globally, first time to announce full structure of the name. What is your first impression of this name? Too long. I think so too. But This name Represent the goal we aim to fulfill. We are building scalable and open software platform. It includes Nissan scalable open data tool for developer. To create new application and services, these are scalable open data. Easy access to our vehicle data for data-driven value generation with ensuring security. Nissan scalable OpenS, a flexible operating system for vehicle supporting. To update and upgrade for new features. This platform help us innovate faster and work with partners around the world. I'll touch upon the deep dive on our platform. This is overall structure of our SDB platform. Our platform covers not only 3 major enablers, but also vehicle systems, OG reprogramming, OTA. User interface. Engineering crowd, and more. Data comes from OS is analyzed and transformed for software development. New application developed by SDK and back to OS for customer. This shire cycle and cyclic speed is the most important. So, Look again. Data comes from all vehicles. Analyzing a transform for new values of their development in SDK. That application Back to your vehicle through ODA. This open software platform. I foundation for future SDB development. And our collaboration with AWS helps us to move forward towards our SDB vision. I will hand over to Kasimoan to explain. Nissan and AWS collaboration detail. Rajmusan, please. OK. Thank you Susan. Yeah, as Susan mentioned, uh, this is the Nissan's, uh, software, uh, scalable open software platform. This is a very first globally first time to announcement. Yeah, so now, uh, I'm the casual Kajimoto principal solutions architect in AWS. I would like to, uh, deep dive, uh, dive, dive deeper, uh, how AWS collaborated to accelerate the to realize the Nissan's scalable open software platform. And AWS has collaborated with Nissan from 2023. And the and the SUV supports AWS or AWS supports three main pillars. One is the true on AWS. In the Nissan, it is named Engineering Cloud. So tools on AWS uh provide the quick deployment, fast CICT automation and global scalability, and this is the base of AI agent for developers. And the second pillar is the target on AWS. This is a virtual ECU. Thanks to AWS Graviton, AWS Graviton can, uh, provide the real-time virtual ECU that is binary compatible with the physical ECU according to the environmental quality. And in Nissan, then this is their digital twin architecture. And Nissan commits to provide the 3OS layer virtualization. 3 OS operating system consists of the Autoza and real-time voice for functional safety, and the third one is the Linux. And rightweight content management on Linux, it is so important. After that, I will touch upon this. And she hears seamless uh linkage and those kind of the uh items are based on the AI agent for customers, that is the drivers and passengers. And the third pillar is the data-driven on AWS that is data platform. Data platform for a scale and uh reliable vehicle data acquisition. And data management framework and finally, regional privacy policy compliance. So then, today, I mainly focus on the uh engineering crowd on Nissan's scalable open software platform. Please look at the, the figure. This is the uh rock diagram of the engineering cloud in the Nissan scale of open software platform as Simonson mentioned. And the engineering cloud on AWS provides three big features. First one is a CI process automation which uh achieved the testing time reduction to the 75% of. And second one is a work, a work event port that provides a global accessibility and quickly deployment around 1 minute. And the 3rd 1 is a lightweight content management. With Forman, which provides a better security, fewer resources, and serious integration. So then thisfield describes the architecture of first uh features C process automation. And this CI process automation consists of 23 5 lines. One is a model code software components 35 line. Then second one is the uh integration C 5 line. And thanks to HPC adoption and the uh Ferrari processing by auto scaling and rounder, then this architecture achieves 75, 75% exe execucution time reduction relative to original on frames environment very fast as CICD environment we achieved. The second feature is the workbench photo. This is the architecture diagram. And this, uh, workbench photo provides globally accessibility so then each region can deploy common and regional specific environment and Nissan plans to onboard more than 5000, 5000 developers in the future. And this, uh, workbenchport consists of the two layers. One is the container image builder. The second one is a runner. So using this kind of the two layers layer structure, then it provides very uh high speed deploy around 1 minute. And the doctor in doctor capability also supported. Do indo means each tools is represented by the container and multiple container images are packing packing into the one container so then that we named uh this technology as doca in doctor and we simply uh implement realize this doca in Docker capability with our code builder. OK And the third feature is the lightweight content management with Forman. So some of you guys hear about the technology of Forman. So Phoman is one of the content manager and which provides uh. Security is very good and the uh fewer resources than the current conventional doctor. And uh Nissan commits to provide this photo, not only the virtual environment, but also physical issues. So then the each region can deploy content applications to Nissan scalable of uh software platform. says in vehicle and photoman runs across physical issue, virtual issue, and workbench. So this is a digital 3 architecture. And finally, this architecture is integrated to next to AI driven vehicle. So AI agents work in the, in the vehicle. This is our concept and our collaboration with Nissan. Then I'd like to hand over single sign again. Thank you, Cardinal Sam. Now, let's look at the future roadmap of SDB with generative AI. As I said earlier, AI is a strategic enabler to realize our SDB vision. Our SDB roadmap is clear. And along with our in-house software development partner. We are adopting new technology as they. E. I will now introduce our SDV roadmap with AI in more detail now. We are adopting AI in our SDB roadmap, which increases next generation pro pilot. To customers in 2027. This enable door to door driving for customer with AI driver. Going forward, AI ecosystem and AI based software development. It will support With ensuring Quick software development and development cycle. Our roadmap prepares fast development. Uh sorry. Our roadmap prepares us for the future innovation. So we can meet customer needs with confidence. Let's look at the video clip to see how AI bring Idea to arrive. Your vehicle is your personal escape, now becoming smarter with AI and always tailored to you. Hm, it's getting hot. I want the windows to close and the AC to start automatically when it gets hot. Simply speak your wishes. The onboard AI connects to the cloud instantly for real-time analysis. Your personal cloud-based AI will custom build software to upgrade your vehicle and match your style. Wow. Bring your ideas to life without limits. Thank you for your attention. Nissan will continuously provide your air experience with high quality and safety. For today, this is all from my side. Thank you for joining this session. Thank you. Thank you so much.
