Thank you everyone for joining. Um, very excited to talk about, uh, the topic we have today which is about cracking the SMB code and how United Airlines has very successfully been able to do that. Um, so as we have introduction, my name is Kunal. I'm a principal at ZS and I help lead our travel and hospitality practice, um, and who better to talk about this topic than with the person who leads, um, B2B. Marketing and international marketing, a lot of good stuff at United, but before I take away our introduction, Jane, maybe, uh, any, uh, quick introduction that you'd like to share? Sure, thanks, Kal. Great to be here. Uh, my fun fact is this is my second time in Venice this week. I actually was fortunate enough to be in the real Venice, um, earlier this week, just got back on Friday, so I'm just kind of hopping all over time zones, um. My name is Jane. I've been with United for about 6 years. Um, I lead the B2B marketing team, as Kal said, and I have the pleasure of launching this brand new capability, uh, to address the SMB potential. So really excited to chat with you all today. Amazing. Well, thank you again for joining. Thank you everybody for, uh, for joining us for the session. So Jane, let's start all the way at the beginning, um, right? Small and medium business is a, of course, a very attractive. Segment, uh, what did you guys see at United that you thought, uh, you know, highlighted the opportunity or the challenges that you were facing? How did you embark on this? How did you, how, where did this journey start? Yeah, and it's funny, it actually really started to almost my very first day at United Airlines six years ago in 2019, and it was work that you guys were kicking off. Uh, one of the things we asked to do is give us the entire landscape of the. Business travel and the travel market in the US and help us understand where we have opportunities and the number one opportunity of course not surprisingly was the SMB space uh and what we saw is that we had really deep and long standing relationships with some of the world's largest organizations but we had essentially single digit penetration with the small businesses, right? Um, and as we really dug into that, we realized it's because we didn't have a capability to serve them profitably, um, so that's really where it started, very simply looking at the landscape and identifying a white space where we had really, really low penetration. Yeah, and, uh, you know, as you were speaking, I was just looking out at, at folks and, uh, you know, you see a few nods here too. Uh, I don't think it's uncommon. Uh, among any industries, uh, to, to, to target and acquire small and medium sized businesses, very hard to go after with traditional sales forces because the ROI is just not there. But of course now with the, um, uh, you know, with, with, uh, innovation and B2B marketing and just more tech more broadly, uh, we can actually do this efficiently, effectively, um, so as you embark on as you guys embarked on that journey, can you talk a little. Bit about how you used some of what's available now to to win some of these customers. Yeah, absolutely as we went to build the story of how we wanna go after this opportunity, one of the questions we knew we had to answer is what are we gonna do differently this time because it wasn't the first time that United tried to go after this opportunity as you can imagine in fact, we joked around at the time that we still have United Business go as a registered trademark for the last time that we had tried it. So it wasn't even that long ago that we had failed and our competitors had also failed so the question that we really asked ourselves what are we gonna do differently this time. And as I was building the story I realized it had to be this idea that it's not a technology, it's an ecosystem that we had to build that's really around 4 parts. Uh, the first part of the ecosystem is of course the, the, the site itself, a place for SMB customers to go to sign up for their program. The second piece was the digital market. capability to drive them to the site and actually get them to sign up and engage. The third piece of it was the data that was gonna allow us to build our target list, build our segmentations off of those target lists, and, you know, actually again kind of attract them through the digital marketing capability. And finally it was the team like we needed to. Actually have a team to orchestrate all this. It wasn't just building a portal or building some sort of system and push and go. It really had to be a full, uh, ecosystem of those four components, um, and that's what I've been preaching since that day is it has to be all of those four elements together in order to build the right foundation to scale this in the long term. Yeah, it's a, it's a great point and for those of you who may not be as familiar with the travel industry, especially on the B2B side, on the corporate travel side more broadly, there's sort of two buyers, right? There's the, the buyer that we call, uh, uh, you know, a corporate travel manager, the ones who decide to sign up for a program with United, right, for instance, or any other company, um, and those could be for a small business, could be a CEO, it could be a CFO, it could be a head of procurement, it could even be a sort of designated travel. Manager, right, but then there's also the second piece which is the people who actually travel, the end travelers, all of us, uh, right, and those people, so the way we like to, you know, characterize it is you gotta, you gotta get on the shelf and then you gotta get picked off the shelf, right? And, and I think, um, you know, to win both those pieces like Jane said, you have to win in B2B marketing, you have to win in B2C marketing because you get the, you know, you have to have the end travelers, uh, uh, pick you. You have to have a dashboard that allows you to manage the. Program and even a dot com capability where you go to united.com, say, and you want all your fares to sort of seamlessly appear uh for you, your corporate rates to pull through and so on, uh, and of course technology is a big element. Jane talked a little bit about people and process and we'll talk about that in a second, but Jane, can you talk a little bit about more of a little bit more about the technology because United has done such good stuff, uh, in enabling this and even allowing for the sort of seamless experience and connecting all of these four pieces. Yeah thank you um let me unpack that a bit because I think you've said some a lot of important things there, um, so yeah, it's helpful to understand our, our ecosystem and both the travel manager and the travel that we're working with, um, but as advice to all of you, I'm sure not all of you are in the travel industry, uh, I think the piece of advice there is to think through that those layers of influence and understand when you need to unlock that influencer and with what particular message and that's exactly. What we did in our case, right when we're talking to the travel manager we're talking about savings that they can deliver for their company that maybe is not necessarily the most relevant message to the traveler, but to the traveler manager that's what's important. Some of the reporting tools we offer on our portal, that's important to them, right? So we sort of attract them with the right messaging, uh, to influence them to click that button to get into the program. But the journey doesn't end there as Kunal said, and there's that second layer of influencer the traveler actually has to still book the trip and put that into their cart. And that's where the technology piece was really important. We wanted that to be super simple, so essentially you just link your work email address to, uh, your business account and your discount show up automatically in your app, right? So we wanted to leverage the existing B2C and traveler ecosystem that already exists at United, um, so they book the exact same way they've always booked. They just kind of click a business travel button versus the personal travel button, right? Um, and we do have amazing technology if you guys are not United flyers, uh, we do have the number one app out there, so I highly recommend first of all, flying United and downloading the app if you haven't. It's, it's truly, it's truly amazing and world class, um, and again, as a traveler we're not trying to reinvent the wheel for you, but you get those discounts, you get access to all of that program through the tools and channels you already are using. Amazing. And so you know I'm sure a lot of folks here are thinking, you know, as you talked about technology. You know, take us behind the scenes in terms of maybe some of those, I don't know, kinks or, uh, you know, some of the challenges you might have run into or some of the key success factors that you were thinking of executing on this technology, right? What were some of those learnings that you had? I know in my opinion, you went through this process it's probably the most patient and best in class way of going through this, but may maybe you can share a little bit more, uh, with the audience in terms of, you know, some of those things that, that don't make the newsreel. Yeah, no, absolutely, and there's a lot, a lot of lessons there. I'm sure there's some things I'll share with you that are not gonna be super surprising, but it's, it's amazing how, how you can lose sight of it. Um, number one is again it kind of goes back to telling that story, so we built the story, we build an airtight story and we told it over and. Over and over and over again I cannot tell you the number of times I've presented the same slides at different layers of the organization. I know it's not ideal, but obviously you know it is a giant company a lot. I was probably working in giant companies, but it's just being consistent in the storytelling and at all levels and at different parts of the organization. So by the time that we got that funding approved, everyone was bought in from the DT team that was building the technology to the finance team that was funding the technology to of course the sales team that was gonna implement this technology, everyone knew what it was and a slight nuance to this too that I was actually reflecting on recently. We, we kind of internally branded this thing and I wasn't necessarily thinking that's what we were doing, but I realized that was a key, uh, you know, a key factor in our success. We called it a small business demand center, right? We gave it a name that was very clear, very definitive of what it was, and it was meant to be an internal name. Uh, to help define this new capability, and every time I talked about it, I talked about it's not a technology, it's not a platform, it's this new capability, so I think that was another key factor in the success and of course once we got the funding we kept telling that story and we continue to tell the story of that success. I would say the second, um, factor is don't wait for all the pieces to be perfectly in place to start, right? Uh, we had to start somewhere. We, you know, had really grand visions of building 4, ML algorithms that were gonna help us target and segment the customers and decide the next best action, but the reality is we weren't gonna build all of them and then start, right? We had to start somewhere, so we also the portal was gonna have all this functionality, but to be perfectly honest, we're 2 years into the launch and we're still. Building out that functionality but we had to start somewhere um and we're slowly scaling, slowly optimizing slowly tweaking and the beauty of that approach is we now have an installed user base of real customers that are providing real-time feedback so we're not training our algorithms on sort of hypothetical data that we bought from a third party we're training it based on what's actually happening and what our customers are actually doing. And sure we've had some learnings and I'll kinda talk about it in our closing and some of our improvements we've learned that what we went out with we went out with 3 options. Well, guess what? People are 90% of our customers are choosing one of those options so clearly we, you know, weren't as, uh, differentiated or distinctive in those options as we thought we were, but. Still so happy to be learning live and have the ability to adapt because it is also giving us the credibility to ask for more funding and to ask for additional investment because we can say that we're we're bringing high quality incremental revenue and just not just in our hubs from our spokes as well. You know, I, personally and just being a small part of this journey with you guys, I think one of the things that that stood out to me was the patience, uh, you know, the patience that this is not a weeklong exercise or a month long exercise or even a, a few months. It took a lot of fine tuning of these algorithms of that for the targeting to actually work, uh, you know, I know that there were some like you didn't see success. Success immediately uh there was some success pockets of success, but then you kept, you, you stayed the course it felt like leadership and just cross functional alignment and commitment to the cause sort of was a key aspect. I know it might sound theoretical, but in reality that was important as everyone believed in the outcome and said, hey, let's let's stay the course and let's stick with it. Is that, is that a fair representation of of what happened? Fair representation and and my other piece of advice here is be really clear on ultimately what is that metric that you're measuring, right? So we did go out and say hey finance, give us X amount of dollars and we're gonna give you 100 million bajillion dollars, right? And at the end of the day we did not deliver on our year one number and we had to go in front of finance and we had to explain the conversation and. It was actually one of the best meetings I've ever had because we went into that meeting saying we did not hit our objectives, but what does, what really matters, it's not the revenue that's flowing through it's not the number of accounts that we've signed up, but it's the fact that these are incremental customers that are what we call in our business high yield, which you know, just means they paid a lot of money for the plane ticket, uh, so. And, and so we focused on that metric that we're bringing in high yield incremental revenue into the system, um, that definitely still more than paid back the investment that we made out the money so we didn't hit our goal in terms of the number of accounts we didn't hit our goal in terms of the overall revenue, but ultimately what finance cares about is high quality incremental revenue and we got that. So of course I mean we're here at at at Reinvent Technology is obviously the cornerstone of what happened here but um I I I don't think it would be uh I think it would be unfair to say that this was an only a technology effort because I. At least just from having seen this again from our lens, uh, the team that you had in place, the operating model of how you worked with technology, revenue management, other functions, um, just overall there was much more than just the technology, you know, can you talk a little bit about some of those other enabling factors. For success, yeah, absolutely. In fact, one of the elements of our the funding that we asked for was a project we did with you guys to help us build the team, to write the job descriptions, to write an operating model of how this team was gonna work within the broader organization. And we still obviously uh have fruit from that so that was a really important part of it, right? It wasn't just we got this head count and then we're done we wash our hands clean. We really had to think about how does this new team work within the existing structure and what are those SOPs, um, that we're all aligned to and the other thing I would say is it's really, really important to hire the right person to lead that team, right? Uh, there is, you know, a very specific skill set when you're launching something brand new. That person has to be collaborative. They also have to be really comfortable working in gray areas and just, just in general, I think, uh, that's the number one thing I evaluate these days, like, are you able to work in gray area because there's no more black and white in this world, uh, so, um, that was really important and someone who has an insane amount of ownership, right, someone who's gonna break down. barriers and make it happen because it's really challenging. It is really challenging, especially when you start so that would be my other tip if you're building out a new capability like this to address SMU uh potential be really, really thoughtful of who you put at the helm of that kind of organization. That's right, um, and she is great. She knows who she is, but she's, uh, great, and, and I, and I do think overall ownership of this program and you know you talked a little bit about SBDC and the branding. Uh, but you know, one of the things I've, I've heard you say is, hey, it's not just a technology, it's a capability. Uh, it feels like this is one of those things that all these three pieces have to sort of work together for it to really all 4 pieces, 4 pieces, uh, but all the pieces have to work together for this to really work well. Absolutely fantastic. All right, so, uh, you know, we have a few more minutes. I was just looking at the time. We have a few more minutes. So Jane, maybe if we can close with what's next, right? Uh. SPDC of course is yielding tremendous value to United and targeting the right customers. It's taken time, but you know you're of course hitting your stride now, but I don't think we can walk past a booth here without talking about agentic AI or or some of the innovations that are that are on the on the horizon. So maybe can you share a little bit about where where SBDC goes from here? Yeah, absolutely. I can mention, you know, 3 things that we're continuing to tweak on. I already touched on a couple of them, but I'll just expand on it. Number one, like I said, we did learn that the products that we put out in front of our customers did meet one segment of the opportunity but missed a pretty big one and so we spent a lot of time trying to address that. So we've essentially, uh, satisfied the people that are just wanting straight discounts on their tickets, right? They don't care about anything else. I'm just trying to hit the save the bottom line for my company. So we have a plan for that that's been really successful. That's the one that 90% of our customers. Are signing up for, but there's a segment of customers we're learning that are really into the experience and into the freebies, right? So they wanna be earning the freebies and the points that they can redeem for free things and that was not something that we have the technology to build into the portal initially. We had a feeling that was going to be the case, to be honest, because we clearly understand our customers well, but we also knew that technology wise we weren't gonna be able to launch in a time, so we chose to launch with a discount only program. We're having a pretty good sense that we were gonna have to do this follow up work and that's exactly what we're doing and we just launched, we just announced that we're going to launch that phase of the plan, uh, mid of next year where customers will be able to sign up and they don't receive discounts but they slowly earn, uh, benefits and rewards as they travel with United. The other piece we talked about is that the algorithms, right, we continue to build them out, um, and now we're getting to a phase of it where there's being, it's learning from actual customer behavior, uh, which is really exciting versus kind of hypothetical data that we're buying from a third party. And the next algorithm we're working on is that next best action algorithm which is essentially going to recommend a marketing action to the digital marketing team for a lead that's coming into the platform based on where they're coming from and what they've engaged with from a content. Standpoint to date and what we know from past customers in terms of what drove what was most likely to drive the conversion right so that algorithm is incredibly important and is the final algorithm of what ZS had proposed to us at that time, uh, that we are in the process of building. And finally, of course, you know, Gen AI, we have to talk about a chatbot. Uh, we did introduce a chatbot to the platform. Uh, to be honest, we only have two individuals that are servicing these 10,000 customers that are coming into our portal and so chatbot just makes that more efficient, but the chatbot is just as good as the information we've put in it. It's not generative. It's not very smart, um, and so we are noticing that things are escalating to human. Um, quite often, and so if we want to continue to scale, we're gonna have to improve the generative abilities of that, uh, chatbot to address more of the questions that are coming in. So again we can continue to scale with the size of the team that we currently have. So I would say those are three key initiatives, uh, we're working on for 26. Very exciting and I, you know, honestly I think. For me the biggest takeaway was just the fact that you invested in laying the right foundation, uh, but realized that this wouldn't yield value right off the bat but then continuing to stay the course leadership investments and all of that and then of course now sort of hitting stride, uh, so really inspiring story thank you for sharing, um, Jane, uh, any final. Words or any tips or advice for the for the audience before we we close here before they drag us off stage and there's a 0 on the uh no, I, I think uh my my advice would just be tell your story, be really clear and tight on what your story is, tell your story over and over again and be really focused, uh, in your story on the metrics that matter to your broader organization. Fantastic, thank you very much. Thank you everyone. I think we're right on time. Appreciate everyone's time. Thank you, thank you, Jane so much.
