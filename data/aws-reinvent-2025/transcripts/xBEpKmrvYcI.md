I'm really excited to be here with you all today. My name is Connie Watkins. I lead our sales and customer success team for Amazon Connect here at AWS across the Americas business, so all of the US, Canada, and LATA. I've been leading this team for the last 3 years. It's been an amazing experience. But before coming to AWS in this role, I was sitting in your seat in the audience as a customer. I worked for Geico Insurance for 12 years, um, and had a number of different roles in the organization, but I actually started as an agent in the contact center and moved my way up 6 years in technology. I was an IT director of engineering and then an officer running the operations in Arizona, so a very different lens to look. Through and really thinking about how technology can transform, so just so excited to be here with you all today and I'm so excited because Travis Gelbrick is here from our Petco team and he's gonna be diving deep into how Petco is utilizing Amazon Connect to transform their customer experience. So what I love to do to get us warmed up again, you all just came off of lunch is I'd like to share some data with you to start the conversation and the dialogue. And because we're gonna be talking with Petco today, I brought some data to bear about generative AI changing retail experiences. So the first stat is 71%. So around 71% of consumers say they actually want generative AI embedded in their shopping experiences and roughly three quarters are open to AI generated product recommendations. I would say today I'm a walking testament to this. If you see my kicks down here, my new OnClouds match my t-shirt, matched the orange blazer, all of this was recommendations that I got by shopping on Amazon.com, by going to OnCloud's website. And if any of you raise your hand in the room, if you shop some Black Friday or Cyber Monday sales, yeah, guilty as charged, lots of brown boxes showing up at my house this week, um, a lot of that is being driven by this, right? All of the data behind the scenes is driving these decisions, but it makes it easy, makes it really easy to click by in the cart. The second number I wanted to share is 1200 to 1,300%. You're probably wondering what the heck is this? Um, traffic to US retail sites from generative AI sources, so this is essentially people clicking through AI assistance into stores. It jumped over 1200 to 1,300% within the last few months. That's crazy. I think that really shows how fast the space is changing with generative AI and agentic AI in the mix to drive different behaviors in the retail space. And the last stat I wanted to share is 1 trillion. So this comes from a McKinsey report that was published in October and this is by 2030. US B2C retail market alone could see up to $1 trillion in orchestrated revenue from agentic commerce with global projections reaching as high as 3 to 5 trillion. So this is. A journey that we're gonna all be on together throughout the course of the conversation today I hope you can have some good takeaways about how we see this market changing and some of the key trends, which is where I'll go next. So you're probably sitting in the room and if any day you wake up and you turn your laptop on you're hit with. A lot of new information, right? There's a lot of trends that are coming onto the market all the time and it's kind of overwhelming. It's a lot of oversaturation, so a lot of noise out there, and some trends aren't worth chasing, but others are certainly worth leaning into and truly understanding. And there's 6 that I have on the slide today that I wanted to take you all through together and the first is consumer awareness and adoption. Coming off of the height of the pandemic, there was a heightened perception for customers, right? It all got us changing our behaviors, doing a lot more digitally, and we're increasingly tech savvy, we know what we want when we want it. And we're very demanding, so a lot of higher expectations from consumers and the experience that they want to get and receive for digital self-service and a growing understanding from our consumers as well around data privacy and, and their rights. So very important to really unlock that and understand that. The next is the new front door. Um, digital first interactions are becoming more prevalent. I think we're still in a basically an 80/20, 80% of traffic coming through CX is still over the phone. Um, but we're starting to see that really shift in a different direction, and that's being driven by generative AI and agentic AI and changing that dynamic. I, I often call it flipping the funnel. How can you flip the funnel and have a different conversation with your customer where you're bringing data forward, you're being hyper personalized in the conversation that you're having. Uh, and it's creating this new front door. You have to be able to stitch across all of your multi-channel experiences to meet your customers where they are, whether they're going on to your mobile app, whether they're on your website, they're calling in, all of that has to be orchestrated together to create this better experience through that new front door. The third pillar that I wanna talk about is competitive forces. I think about my world at GEICO and my previous role. We're all in what I would consider to be a takeaway business at this point. Consumers have options. They have choices out there. There, how do you stand out? Technology is often the differentiator for customers in where they kind of take their brand and where they go next. So thinking about how to handle that and, and unpacking that is really important relevance and hype. I think this might be my favorite one, and it kind of attaches back to not all trends are worth chasing. Um, but it's focusing on the practical solution over the buzzwords. So where can you start in your journey for AI adoption that's truly going to add value for your customers? What are those friction points that you really feel like you need to address that's causing pain that you could see return on investment from quickly and not just falling into the relevance in the hype cycle? We're definitely in the, the hype cycle for agentic AI. Raise your hand again. How many if you've sat through a lot of agentic conversations, right, uh, as you've gone through the sessions here at Reinvent, it's the theme we're probably in the trough of disillusionment right now coming up, but you gotta be able to hone in on a use case or a POC that's really going to help your organization drive value and meet your customers and what they truly value. So understanding that first is very important. The next is buried value. So I love to talk about data with my customers, data as the foundation for everything that you do. Uh, and I talked to a customer yesterday, and she said our data is like gold, and wow, that's a powerful, powerful image, right? I completely agree your data is like gold. So how do you take that buried value and make your data impactful, understand it, and really tune it to the optimizations and the goals that you have, and we're definitely in an agentic shift, right? We're gonna talk about some of the pillars that you should be considering as you think about agentic journey in your organizations next. But it's all about scaling meaningful and measurable experiences, and the future really belongs to those customers who can turn every interaction for their customer into impact. The measurable aspect is crucial here here because every touch point must be quantifiable, allowing us to track impact through concrete metrics and this is kind of going beyond, you know, the, the traditional metrics of customer satisfaction, engagement rates. I'm trying to help my customers really start to think about well what comes next? How are you measuring containment across your entire ecosystem? If a customer's making a phone call but they chat to you 30 minutes later, was that really successful? Or do you have something else that you need to explore? So creating moments that matter for your customers, creating hyper personalized experiences where you're giving them the outreach in the moment that matters most to them is really going to be the, the winning combination in the future. So again, how do you think about getting started on your journey to Agentic and there's 4 things that came out of a Harvard Business Review article that was published in October. And the first is designing around outcomes. And again, what I first mentioned was making sure you really understand where you're trying to take your customer, what, what is the goal you're trying to reach, what value are you trying to create, and working to design around those outcomes. But first you have to bring people along with you. And I did a lot of this in my prior life of identifying people within the organization that could be change champions in the article it referenced them as accountable mission owners and I really loved that as well, right? Are we all on a mission together to really understand how agentic is going to unlock? You have to have folks that are willing to understand. Explore the technology, test the technology because things are changing so very rapidly. The conversation that we're having today on December 2, 2025 in six months is gonna be very different. In 12 months will look very different. So really making sure you bring folks into your organization that can help propel and drive that change is so important. And again I love data. I love talking about data, unlocking data silos and clarifying business logic. So the great thing about agentic and generative AI, it can often go across your data silos, right? It can pull the pieces that matter out. But where I see my customers struggling most today as they stand up agentic experiences and generative experiences is when they themselves really haven't looked at their knowledge content. They don't know where their knowledge base is, and it may be outdated. They might pull up something and oh wow, we haven't updated this since 2021. And I say bad data in equals bad data out. That's not going to empower the right experience for your customer that you're, you're trying to drive. So really making sure you understand that business logic, clean it up so that you get those powerful outcomes to drive that ROI. And then the last and probably most important piece of this, and it's kind of attached to the accountable mission owners is developing the leaders and the guardrails so I know I'm on an educational journey. I'm trying to learn and be curious every day as this landscape changes. You have to make sure you're investing in that yourself as leaders but also bringing that to your team. How can you make sure that everyone is learning together because this is moving very fast and developing things together that's going to drive things forward. So as I hand things over to Travis, uh, to dive deeper into the journey of Petco, I just wanted to leave you all with these things to think about the and the work that you do every day, and I say it often, think big, start small, and iterate. Where I see often everyone go wrong is we wanna try to boil the ocean and do everything at one time, but if you corner in on where you wanna drive that value, what is the most friction-filled experience, and target that first, you're gonna likely have a better outcome. So without further ado, and this is the most exciting part, I'm so excited to welcome Travis Gilbert to the stage to share more about the Petco journey and where they're going next. Connie might have oversold the exciting part. Uh, good afternoon. Thank you for choosing to come to our session and learn a little bit more about Petco's journey with Amazon Connect. Two years ago I was sitting in your seat. It was my first reinvent. I was new to my job and I was new to Amazon Connect and um we had, we were using Amazon Connect for phone and IVR. We just made the decision to move conversational analytics to contact lens, and we were facing a big decision about chat on our chat platform while everyone's talking about AI, including leadership of the company, um, and so sitting in your shoes I had two big burning questions. How do we make sure that we get the most business and customer impact from our technology investments, um, and then also what horse are we gonna ride into the AI future like what platform are we gonna choose and how important that decision was gonna be for us in terms of what was coming. So my hope for you today is that you learn a little bit or something maybe a takeaway from our journey that you can take back to your business. Before I get too far, I wanna acknowledge that I represent customer care at Petco, which is one of many teams, a cross-functional, dedicated team of people that have come together to do what I'm gonna share with you today and continue to work together. That includes customer care, Petco IT, and product management, and our trusted partners with Pronatics and Julia. I'm gonna ask the Pronatics folks to raise their hand real quick. Thank you guys. uh, I feel really blessed to have a great group of partners and stakeholders that are kind of in service of the customer outcomes that we want. So with that, who's Peco? Um, we're where the pets go. So we are one of the biggest US pet retailers in the US with over 1500 stores in the US and Mexico. Um, we are celebrating 60 years this, uh, being in business this year, and we're one stop shop, meaning that you can. Come in and buy dog food and cat litter and accessories and collars. You can get your dog trained, your dog groomed. You can get a vaccination shot for your pet, and we have veterinary hospitals all under one roof. On top of that, our nonprofit foundation, Petco Love has helped more than 7 million pets find homes, uh, and so we're very proud of that. So a little bit about our landscape and customer service. So we have roughly 400 care team members, um, are, and we service everything. We take calls about complaints from the stores. We take, we help people book veterinary appointments or grooming appointments, um, but roughly half, a little less than half now of our volume is around e-commerce. So I ordered on the phone, I ordered on the website. So all the things you would imagine, where's my order, payment issues, all those things, um, let me have a show of hands and who has a pet at home. All right, keep your hands up if you consider that pet to be part of your family and sometimes in competition for favorite family member, right? So you can imagine that some of the contacts we get are very emotional, particularly when it comes to prescriptions, um, or maybe you're on repeat delivery and we didn't deliver your dog food when we committed to delivering it and you are out of dog food. So we have to be really good at handling some of those, uh, contacts. A little bit about our journey. I'm gonna go through each of these in more detail. So for us, the business strategy is what are the business and customer outcomes that we really want to achieve, and we'll talk later. But, and as, as Connie mentioned, sometimes you get that out of order because we all get excited about the shiny object and the technology. But what is it that. We're here to do what is it we wanna have happen for the customer. Technology strategy is, OK, how are we gonna leverage technology in that investment to go deliver those outcomes? And then finally I've been doing this for a while. I truly believe one of our biggest charters at the company is about voice of the customer and how we amplify that. So our business strategy, um, like many of you, we are constantly balancing cost and customer satisfaction. So how do we get the best service, best quality of service, best customer satisfaction for the lowest cost? And the way that we think about this or have come to think about this is really trying to understand the impact we can have on the customer in a, in a particular inquiry. So where's my order? Most of the time, probably not a lot of impact we can have on that customer in terms of upping their loyalty. However, if a pet passed or maybe you're gonna, maybe you're part of our Vital Care Premier paid membership and you wanna cancel, maybe you're a, a high lifetime value customer, those are high impact conversations that we wanna have. We wanna invest in a great human interaction, right, whereas maybe some of the other ones we would, we're happy to use AI or some other self-help experience that still needs to be great, but differentiating these is the way that we think about balancing that trade-off. Technology strategy. So I've been in lots of organizations where we had 5 or more different applications stitched together to try to make the customer service function work for agents or whatever else, and I have a strong perspective, and I think the team has a strong perspective that we want fewer integrations. We don't have an unlimited technology budget. We have very finite resources. We don't. Wanna spend that time managing a bunch of integrations and trying to extract data or transcripts from this system to try to get the insights out of a different system. So it's one of the reasons Amazon Connect works really well for us because we have contact lens with the transcripts. We've got calls we have IVR, we have chat all running through the same platform and so we get to benefit from that native integration. And we want someone who has an aggressive road map. Like we know what AI can do for our business, and we want someone who's keeping up with those trends and is frequently delivering new features. And then finally, it has to be enterprise grade. We have, it has to scale. It has to protect data, uh, and our IT infosec teams have to be happy and comfortable that what we're choosing is, is gonna protect those things. And then finally, voice of the customer, we talked to more than 10,000 customers a day. That's equivalent to more than 30 of our retail stores. So, and of course, like many of you, the customers only reach out when they have a problem. So we really truly are the best source, I believe, in the company of customer insight. The challenge is unlocking that insight and doing it in a way where we can go have a conversation. With the business stakeholders say, did you know that you had a promotion problem yesterday and we got 1500 calls about that and oh by the way that cost this much and here is the CSAT scores on those calls and by the way that probably reflects a bunch of people who stopped and didn't check out because of the promotion. So those are the types of things that we wanna surface from our conversations with customers. So wins so far this is probably what y'all came to hear about, um. Speed of implementation has been very helpful for us with Amazon Connect and I'll give you two examples. Um, we did a pilot with the grooming salon, so grooming is usually in our store, and there's a set of groomers, and they're actually. We want them grooming pets, but they also are supposed to be answering the phone. And so imagine you're on a, you're grooming a dog on a table, it's a little bit squirrelly. The phone rings, you have to take the dog off the table, put it in a crate, run over to the office, answer the phone, hopefully book an appointment, and then go back. It doesn't work very well. So, but our grooming swans have. Individual numbers and so the IT team had to work with us to say OK we're gonna do this pilot we wanna route all of those numbers to the call center and we started with like 6 grooming salons. A similar example was with our veterinary hospitals where we support about 100 vet hospitals where the calls come direct to the contact center. We didn't have an IVR at first, but. Our biggest call driver was vet and tech callbacks, meaning your dog's at the vet, they called you and you're calling back. Well, it was getting to an agent who was just gonna transfer it to the hospital, no value add a bunch of costs. So in both of those cases, they, the IT team was able to build those IVRs, reroute the calls within a couple of weeks versus a couple of months and having it be a big production. So that was very valuable for us. All right, from an AI perspective, I'm gonna show you a screen in a minute, but we're doing call summaries. We have that turned on on Amazon Connect. The benefit of that initially the big focus was we take those and we put it right in the case notes. So hopefully we're bringing down handle time. Um, we are bringing down handle time as a result of that. What's also become very valuable for our team is that when we're trying to find out what's going on with a customer, it's so much faster to just read the paragraph and go, oh yeah, I know what's going on, and we can move faster with that. Automated QA. I'm gonna show you again the screen you can see it, um, but we're starting down the path of automating a lot of the QA that many all of us know you're usually using coaches that sample on a very infrequent basis. We're getting some insight from being able to do it. The example I'll give you is we found out. From customer satisfaction results, that one of the biggest drivers is when the agent puts the customer on hold for 2 minutes or more that we would start to see a degradation in results. So we created a rule in Amazon Connect that happens on every single call to flag, OK, this, this agent is putting customers on hold way too much. What do we need to learn about that? What action do we go take? Um, AI supported agent assistance, we're just getting into this now with our chat launch, um, but we're really excited about getting away from an agent having to open an article, kind of figure out what they need and where to find it to have an Amazon Connect and Cuban Connect, just pop a paragraph and answer based on the transcript that's running, and we think we're just scratching the surface. We think there's a lot more to be had there. And then finally, uh, in November, early November we launched chat on Amazon Connect and it included a chatbot. So we're using Amazon flows for about 4 high frequency things like order status, those types of things, and we've started out small we've loaded 20 KB articles into what is before reinvent Q and Connect, um, loaded it and are getting Gen AI answers to those and so we're learning a lot, um, but we're really excited to start adding more and more articles so we can expand that. Um, I will tell you, big lesson learned. We thought we had all of the utterances covered and we didn't, and so we're learning a lot and we're adding those in real time. And then finally, uh, before that again working with our partner Pronetics, we, uh, started to put order status in our IVR, pretty straightforward. If we see that you have an order and we can match the Annie, then we're saying, hey, I see that you have an order. Is that what you're calling about? If yes, then we read the information back to them and then at the end of that, if they still need help, then we let them go to an agent. So for those of you, most of you probably have seen this, but for those of you who haven't seen this, here is the screen when I go look at a particular contact, and you can see AI happening here in 3 places. So up in the upper right, this is the contact summary. Much easier than reading the transcript. In the middle is those rules from a QA perspective and again we this was taken when we only had a couple of rules launched you can see though I like how this shows hey this is what happened on this contact the agent average and then um all contacts average and then on the bottom is is sentiment both at the beginning and. The end of the call we're still learning how to use this um my early thoughts is that we wanna produce a dashboard for a supervisor or a team manager that shows them their whole team and shows a bunch of metrics including kind of ending sentiment so that the supervisor knows where to go spend their time and which agents to spend more time with. What's next? Um, we are in business requirements right now to drive towards conversational IVR. We're super excited about this both from a customer experience perspective but also what it's gonna do for our routing, um, and we hope to both make it easier for the customer to tell us what they're calling about but also bring in a lot of information from our customer CRM system so that we're doing a lot smarter routing. Um, I mentioned we had 20 articles and we've got some flows. We think there's, we're just scratching the surface. So for example, next year we're hoping to be able to have a customer book an appointment, like a grooming appointment or vaccination appointment in the chatbot and eventually over voice using Amazon Connect. Today we're just sending them to a link, but we can't see if we lose the customer in that motion or not and so we're excited about that. And then just more voice the customer insights we're really trying to squeeze as much insight out of contact lens as we can, um, but we think we can do a lot better even than what we have today. Lessons learned. Click, um, uh, Connie mentioned this, but it's so true, and I'm, I'm guilty of what my team would tell me I'm guilty of this. You gotta focus on business outcomes and customer outcomes first before you get into the really cool technology. Um, the technology really is, is the how and getting really clear on the what. And, and I think for me and the team is like hey what's, what's the outcome we want, how do we measure that outcome, and let's, let's have a metric and so then we can everything else flows from that and they, and the how becomes a lot cleaner and simpler, at least make those decisions if we're really clear on what we're trying to achieve. Prioritize reporting, I, I'll tell you that is so true right now. We have thousands of chatbot experiences a day and we're trying to make sure we understand, OK, what are the utterances that are getting missed, where customers dropping out or abandoning in that experience. So having good reporting on that so that you can then tune and, and, um, as Connie mentioned, iterate becomes super important. Uh, data readiness for AI, so we spent a lot of time with the Amazon team on those first articles and making sure that we had them formatted in the right way, which was different than how we had them formatted with agents. And so we spent a lot of time in that. We're still learning how, how the format and even the contents of the article impacts the outcome both for AI direct to the customer but also for agent assist. And so we're on a, we're definitely on a journey, um, in that regard. And then change management matters. So, um, we're all super excited about this, but we had a bunch of other stakeholders in the organization. That we had to go basically sell on our approach we're using AI for something that was really scary, um, for those of you who are maybe in this space already, you know that there's a bunch of state specific laws in the US that make this a little bit more complicated. We went through our AI governance council, um, and then we got, we had a bunch of stakeholders on board and say this is what we're trying to accomplish. This is how we're using AI. This is how we're safeguarding that, um, so lots of lessons learned there and we continue to report back. And finally, um. Designing for the future, my big worry when I spend time with the technology teams is, hey, we're on a journey. This thing is just like Connie mentioned, this thing's gonna look totally different in 2 years. We can't corner ourselves. Let's make sure the way we're architecting this is gonna set us up to just keep building and building and building. We can't put ourselves in a corner and not be able to or have it be a big effort for us to design out of that. So I think this is my last slide. Again, my hope is that you learned something from our journey that you can take away. Thanks again for spending time with us today and I do apologize. I'm bolting to catch a flight to make a family commitment, um, but thank you again for spending time with us. Thank you so much. Awesome. Thank you. Good to see you. All right, can we give a round of applause to Travis since he said it out? Thank you so much, Travis. It's always so powerful hearing from a customer that you may be thinking, OK, how am I gonna apply this in my organization? What might it look like? So really wanna thank Travis for sharing his story, um, and now I'm super excited, uh, because I get to share with you some of the awesome announcements that we just made for Amazon Connect, all of which were announced yesterday in Pasquale DeMayo's keynote, uh, but we have several things that are out in the space we had over almost 30. Announcements for reinvent this year and I'm just sharing the tip of the iceberg, only 4, so what I encourage everyone to do after this as we get through talking about all of these announcements is please go check out our booth A 13 on the floor. You can dive a lot deeper into what, what you'll be able to see. So I'm super pumped. This is probably my favorite announcement because I think this has been long awaited. We were working through beta, a lot of testing with our customers around agentic self-service with humanlike voices. This is the integration that we have with Nova Sonic and Amazon Connects, and it's. Really meant to deliver more conversational expressive voices it's truly gonna understand uh the customer's tone and intonation and be able to optimize to that. So a very powerful thing here from a conversational AI perspective to deliver those great outcomes that our customers are expecting. So AI voice agents can autonomously now handle complete customer interactions. It has adaptive voice responses matching customers' conversational style, and of course that escalation to human agents if and when it's needed. The next announcement I wanted to share with you all this afternoon is transforming data into relationships through our AI powered predictive insights, and this is in preview right now. So Amazon Connect is now providing AI powered predictions that transform customer understanding through 5 recommended algorithms, and the system is analyzing customer behavior and interaction history and providing suggestions tailored to both self-service and agent, uh, self-service interactions. So I love this one because this kind of goes back to that example I shared at the beginning where I was talking about my blazer and my kicks. So this is where we're able to recommend similar item suggestions, frequently paired items for cross selling. So if my blazer matches my shoes, like maybe I'll, I'll buy that, right? So all of those great recommendations and popular and trending item recommendations. So again this is in preview and there'll be more announced on it soon. The next is evaluating the performance of self-service interactions. I think this is equally important, um, really understanding and making sure that not only can you understand what your human agents are doing, but what are your AI agents doing. So this is a unified view that's gonna bring all of that together so you can understand how your agents are performing, how your AI agents are performing to drive those good outcomes. And then last but not least is accelerating outcomes with AI agent observability. So this is all about the fact that we've released and introduced new metrics that help organizations measure and improve AI agent performance in customer interactions. Contact center administrators can now access detailed performance data to optimize their AI implementations, ensure that quality control. So how we're doing that is through measuring percentage of AI involved contacts and those handoff rates where contact might have to hand off to a human agent tracking conversational. Firms for self-service and monitoring average handling time for agent assistance cases. So super excited to share just these 4 again, the tip of the iceberg, but there's so much more to unlock this week as it relates to customer experience with Amazon Connect. So I just wanna say thank you for coming to our session. There's a lot more happening this afternoon, tomorrow, and Thursday. So please, please take some time. I see a lot of photos happening right now. That's awesome to check out these other sessions and again come and visit us at our. Expo booth. The other thing that I wanna anchor you all on is we talked a lot about learn and be curious today. We talked about going out there and understanding what's coming next. We've actually produced a skill builder course all around all of the releases for Amazon Connect at Reinvent that's available to all of you, so you can go on Skill Builder, check it out, go through all the features. We also have a host of Amazon Connect badges. Um, how many of you have completed an Amazon Connect badge? Raise your hand. Alright, I see a few, few hands. I'd love to see more, so I would challenge all of you if you haven't explored our connect badges, they're great not only for technical folks but also business analysts really for everyone. There's a technical track and a business track and make it a competition, make it fun, right? We all have to be on the same page as we're thinking about these technology transformations, so love to talk with you more about that. That's also something our team at the booth can chat with you on. So thank you, you took time out of your afternoon to join us for the session. I hope all of you learned something new that you can take back and I will close this out here if you all have any questions I'll be available downstage, uh, for any questions. Thanks everyone.
