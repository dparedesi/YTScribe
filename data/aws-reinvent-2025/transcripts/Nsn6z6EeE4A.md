Hello, everyone. Uh, thanks for joining, uh, Supercharged Lambda with Hono. Uh, in the next 20 minutes, uh, I'll show how Hono brings familiar type scriptor web pattern to AWS Lambda. Uh, things like end to end type RPC, uh, product structure we can use in production and And so on. Uh, let's get started. So this is first time for me to be reinvent. So are there any first-time reinvent attendees? Oh. Thank you so much. Uh. Let me begin with introducing myself. Uh, I'm Johnda, prototyping solution architect for Public Sector Japan, and the framework I'm about to introduce, uh, Hono is also made in Japan. Day to day I work with customers. Build and validate prototypes on AWS. So I spent a lot of time uh with uh React, and TypeScript and Hono. So what I'll share today directly comes from Our protime team does. M Here is a brown Yhono for lambda, uh, first, why hono for lambda. Second, a quick overview of Hono, what it looks like and how it runs on lambda. And finally, uh, I'll explain Hono's strengths. Please note that uh we don't cover the detailed architecture of Hono itself. Two grounds why, uh, let me begin with the sentence I hear again and again. I want to deploy a web app or API on Lambda. Does this resonate with you or have you heard the same from your teammates or customers? There are a couple of passes people drive first. Uh, I'll walk through them, uh, so we can see where the friction come from and how Hono helps. First, Red Sea traditional approach rooting in API gateway and Multiple singer Papa Ramadda behind it. It's great for isolation and clear ownership. However, uh, for teams coming from part of a traditional web framework, uh, this model can feel a bit foreign. Uh, routing lives at the edge of the edge, and logic is split across multiple functions. On the other hand, we increasingly see the lambda is pattern. Do you know lambda is pattern? Uh, one lambda that owns. routing and multiple functionalities. Uh, this is often paired, paired with, uh, lambda function URL. With lambda function URL you can go even simpler with direct HTTP endpoint. The right choice depends on your team boundary or team size or scaling needs. Regardless of the route you take, uh, there, there's, uh, some fri, some, still some friction. Uh Lambdahandra and event shape is uh not familiar with uh very standard request response pattern you expect. And the looting and glucode are like uh error handling and so on, uh, often end with built from scratch. And finally, ecosystem feed. Uh, with, even with a great service like Lambda Power tools or API gateway, uh, it is not so common, uh, to build and run web application on lambda compared to content-based stack. Uh, if that sounds familiar, uh, you are in the right room. Then, uh, To address the friction we just saw, the two I want to put on the table is Ho. Hono gives us a Expressed like request response syntax you expect. TypeScript files, uh, express like uh developer experience. From here, I'll start with uh minimal possible follow up. And show how it runs on lambda and how we structure the project and Which, which plug-in cover production needs. This is a minimal possible honor up. You can see upload get and upload post. This API follows. Conventional web framework like Express. If you haven't used Express before, if you have web web application, you can immediately guess what's happening. And next are CJson returns the response Jason, and C. REQ Jason leads the liquid body. Does it seem easy now? Why does honor pair well with lambda? Uh, let me highlight 3 representative reasons, uh, not an exhaustive list. First, uh, runtime abstraction. Once you write one hono app, uh, it runs across multiple runtimes. Second, the ecosystem. Hono has a lot of uh plug-ins and middlewares, uh, which covers the production needs. Third, a lightweight by default. This means you can keep your code bundle small and especially for lambda, uh, you can reduce uh cold start impact, impact. So let's check uh Hono's runtime abstraction. Hono's runtime abstraction looks like this. Uh, one hono up at the top and underneath is uh environment. No JS Dino, lambda, and plenty more runtimes are supported. With Hono. Uh, with Node JS adapter, uh, you can locally spin up the dev server and you can deploy it to container-based, uh, stack like ECS. And of course, you can use our AWS Lambda adapter with uh AWS lambda. Because the Hono app is the same everywhere, you don't need to fork or rewrite code. Par environment. So let's check the Call changes to run hono on lambda. The code change is tiny, just the lines. You should import handle from Arno AWS round the package and wrap it up with it. Uh, just adding two lines, uh, turn Hono up into, uh, Ramadahandra. At this moment, uh, your Hono app is, your, your Hono app works as a first-class runtime uh Ramdahandra. We've just seen the uh turning Hono up into Rhandra just takes two lines, building on that runtime abstraction, uh. The project structure I recommend for debugging lambda locally is like this. Uh, we keep, uh, this is actually, uh, I use for daily prototyping work. I keep 3 small files. Uh, first up in U.DS I write, uh, domain logic and expose the phone app itself. And the second file, hundra.Ts imports the Hono app from A.Ts and export it as a Ramda Handler with Hono and Lambda package we just saw. And finally, index.ts. Also import the Hono app from ATS and line it as a no node J server with Hono node server plug-in. In day to day work, uh, I just run TSX index dada watch, uh, give, uh, then I see how to load, uh, local dev server. When it's time, it's time to ship, uh, I I point in 100s. And park it to Deployment for RAMDA. Uh, the next, uh, Hono ecosystem. Hono's ecosystem uh covers the production needs most teams ask for. For documentation, Hono OpenAPI Hono OpenAPI generates an OpenAPI schema from Zo. Uho is a very famous library for input validation in TypeScript ecosystem. And if you want end to end types, you can use hono crayon, also called Hono RPC. Uh, this generates typed HTTP client from a server side code. And if you, if you just want to input the data, not open API schema. You can use Hono.validdata, uh, discover the simple type-safe validation. And if you want, if you need authentication, there are plenty of plug-ins like. Oh no, or provider. And lately, uh, some people said uh they want to build their own MCP server. With Hono, you can use Hono MCP plug-in, and you can easily build uh MCP server with Hono, with this plug-in. From that is uh We'll dive deep into these two plug-ins, Honos. OpenAPI and HonoClient. First, let's check uh Ho open API. Uh, sorry, uh. On this day, you can have. OpenAPI.json. Uh, let's check the code diff, uh, import, uh, open API hono instead of normal hono and Use it as a hono app instead of normal hono. And you should replace the up get into uh. open API and harrow root. Harrow root is a return value flow of the create root, and it includes the path and the schema. So then, uh, publishing is simple. At, at A.doc in one place and you can have uh open API.json like this. This works out of the box, so you can Use it with uh client SDK generators or uh documentation site. Uh lately, you can Or even fit it LLM to spin up a simple front end. The key is uh schema is always in sync with what the server serves. So, uh, and in the next slide, uh, I'll introduce one more plug-in, uh, Scala Hono API reference. With this plug-in, uh, you can see the open API as an interactive UI, uh, provided by Scalar. Uh, just adding up. getscara. So in this UI you can call uh API directory, of course, and you can copy hardcode and Ruby Node JS PHP Python, and so on. So you can try uh testing uh API easily from here. And the next one is uh Hono RPC Hono client, also called Hono RPC. This is a video clip. I'll play once and rewind to the key moment. I type a constantless we call await client do hello. Don't get And the key moment is Uh It's oh. Bye. In the key moment is uh Here, uh, I, when I type client and hello, uh, the ID offers the completion, uh, like hello or delegate. Uh, this is uh not a guess, uh, uh, but contract. Uh, so let's check, uh, how hono RPG works. Uh, if you want to use Hono RPC, uh, your projector structure looks like this, uh, The lambda directory has a server side code and the front-end directory has a front-end code. And export are app-type from up.TS which is a server side code, and the type of roots means uh like uh Type of uh WhatsApp subs and the client.DS imports the app type and pass it to HC. This is the abbreviation of uh Hooli. So this is designed. Uh, to be used in a monolaer structure, uh, in mind. So the We, uh, the autocomplete we just saw is uh not a, not a guest and but contract, and it is, uh, it works as a type script, type check. So if I long pass or request parameter, uh, the, uh the ID or compiler, uh, catch it before any network calls. So this is a great update for our daily development work. Uh, finally, uh, we just, we saw the three things, uh. Expressed like a friendly syntax and Uh, runtime abstraction and, uh, rich ecosystem, uh, with all, with all that, uh, Hono is the right way. Oh Of course, our final size depends on your code or your dependencies. The best, uh, hono package is around 10 kilobytes. And before wrap, before we wrap up, uh, let's address potential, uh, question, a comparison with lambdawa. The main differences are shown here, uh, we, I won't read them through, but uh if we want to Prioritize the developer experience or start building a new app. New app development with TypeScript, uh, I recommend you, uh, Hono with Lambda. On the other hand, if you want, if you have already built Web application running on other languages or other frameworks, and you want to migrate it, uh, I, I recommend you uh run the web adapter. So quick wrap up with Hono, uh, with HoNO on lambda, you get a familiar DX uh express-like routing, uh, wave framework ergonomics, and uh Hono app is portable. If we want to move away from lambda, uh, You can easily go to the contra-based stack or EC2 or something like that. And, um, and Hono has a Abundant ecosystem, uh. I just introduced two plug-ins, but there are plenty more plug-ins, so I'm sure there's something you want. And And still and it says that lightweight, uh, a baseline bundle is uh Around 12 kilobytes, so go stamp the impact stays small. So, You can try hono lambda after this session.
