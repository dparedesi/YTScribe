Good evening, everyone. My name is Vivek Vilso. I'm an AWS AI hero. You might be wondering what is an AI hero. It's, it's something new category. So AWS just renamed the Machine Learning Heroes category to AI Heroes, uh, category. So, I, I have been a former AWS community builder and AWS ambassador. I have 27 years of experience in the industry. And I'm excited to talk about the transforming Fins of AIDLC with uh Quiro. By show of hands, how many of you, uh, have used Quiro? Excellent. So, even if you have not used Quiro, there are 99 sessions on Quiro, this reinvent, so do, um, sign up for those, uh, breakout sessions, uh, on Quiro. So without further ado, we are going to talk about the challenges in, uh, fins of development cycle and how The spec-driven workflow with uh Kiro is with AIDLC and I'll share the practical examples with best practices, and it's all available in my GitHub repo that I will share at the end, so you can feel free to clone and, uh, experiment with it. So, have everyone seen the explosion today for technical death that happened? Excellent. So that was using AWS Transform, but as you know, technical depth is the invisible drag on enterprise innovation, and More than 20% of the IT budget is spent on technical debt issues. So the developers I worked with, they spend more than an hour every day to fix all these lambda runtime issues, end of life support and container-based image validation. So it's kind of an ongoing issue. The second issue when working with the regulated industries is the compliance burden. So there are heavy penalties and fines if, uh, the application is not compliant with the regulatory requirements. And even if I have to make a single line of code change, I have to run the code through the whole pipeline, which takes 5 minutes sometimes through the pipeline. And that's not a good developer experience. So how do we shift left and instead of the reactive approach? Then the third is all the piling up of the incidents and, uh, unpatched open-source dependency vulnerabilities that leads to a huge security debt in the organization. Now presenting the hero spec-driven workflow. So to summarize, the spec-driven workflow consists of Kiro specs, which is a collection of the kiro requirements, design architecture, and the task. It's kind of a declarative way of producing code. So Kiro compiles the specs into code. Even though these LLMs are not deterministic, you can enforce that, through the agent steering, and that can be used for achieving the compliance. Then we'll talk about the agent hooks. So, agent hooks take care of all the manual mundane tasks, like, uh, updating documentation. Nobody likes to update the documentation every time you change. endpoints. So with Agent Hooks, you can automate all that. And also, I'll show you how to implement the policy as code using Agent Hooks. Then there is an MCP server capability. I'll show you how I can use the diagrams MCP server to speed up the developer experience. Also, MCP servers let you connect to your organization data like uh Confluent SharePoint, Jira, and, uh. Get that output to the LLM so it can produce more accurate data, more accurate application code with the MCP servers. And finally, the Quiro CLI, which you might have used the QCLI, it's the rebranded as Kiro CLI, and I'll show you how the sub agents can be used to improve the productivity and context engineering. So let's start with the agent steering. I built a simple loan approval microservice, so it's an API gateway with a lambda backend, and lambda has got the business logic, and, uh, it saves the results to Dynamo DP and there is a cloud watch for logging. So I implemented this using uh CDK, which is an IAC tool written in TypeScript. The Python was run and the lambda. Running the Python programming language, and Kiiro build all this in less than an hour. So what happens when you use the state of the art models like Cloud Office 4.5? Because of its training data, the CDK libraries, they are still 2.100 instead of 2.170, which is a huge technical debt. Even the typescript libraries are way old. Then what about the 500 times? Claude doesn't know that Python 3.9 was end of life in October 2025. So if I push this code to higher environments, I'm going to get a huge chain of emails. So, how should I, uh, fix this autonomously using Quiro? The answer is global agent steering. So now Quiro supports global agent steering. You define one steering file on your workstation. It will apply that steering to all the projects in your, uh, workstation locally. And what is a steering file? It's just a set of rules in plain English, so you can instruct hero to use all these. Instructions from the steering, like use the stable versions, use, uh, do not hardcode any secrets, and all your organization, uh, guidelines and standards can be used in this, uh, steering file. And, uh, one important tip is that you use words like must, critical. So cloud models are especially tuned to, um, to those keywords like critical masks. So use those keywords, then, uh, cloud respects those, uh, from the steering files. And then if I have those steering files, I can just ask with a prompt to apply that steering file to my code. And then within one minute, the kiro will update all the packages and make it tech date-free. As you know, Kiiro is a VS code 4, just like, uh, uh, uh, Windsurf and, uh, cursor. So, uh, with, uh, Kiro, you can install all the lining extensions like Py Litt, if you're using Python, ESL for TypeScript. So with these extensions, you can get the quick, uh, analysis of your code for any errors. And, uh, if you're not following any best practices, Kiiro will show you right in the ID. Uh, with these lining extensions. But remember, you have to enable these uh extensions. They are not enabled by default. Next up is the agent hooks, which I use for automation. And I'm going to show you how I use the policyS code using Hiro for shift lift. So AWS has a wonderful open-source tool called CFN Guard. That is kind of a DSL, domain-specific language, and it can read a set of rules from, um, every framework. Like for PCI there is a custom set of rules. For New York DFS there is a set of rules. HIPAA has a set of rules, so everything is available in the GitHub repository, which is, uh, shared here. And you can customize these rules for your organization. And it runs those DSL rules on the cloud formation templates. It can also run it on Kuberneti's configuration files and terraform plants. So it's not just cloud formation, but I'll show you how to run in cloud formation. So you have the CFN. To run it with the CLI on those rules and apply it on the configuration locally, the cloud formation configuration, without pushing it on the cloud. And then once all the rules pass, then you deploy. So that's the two-step process. But I don't want to do manual execution. So how do I do that using agent hooks? I just tell Kiro to create an agent hook for me, and how do I trigger it? Just when the infrastructure file is changed, on the file save action, it will trigger these hooks. So, I just, uh, showed the hook how it runs it just to point to fractional credits and just shows me what rules are passed with, uh, within the ID in Kiro. Now, there is another way to run the cloud formation guard using AWS toolkit. So if you have been following the reinvent releases, AWS released the cloud formation language server that has now the capability to Uh, show you the cloud formation, um, stack errors, everything within the Akiro ID. So you don't have to go to AWS console and do contact switching anymore. Everything is available within Kiro. And the same guard rules can be applied within the AWS toolkit in the settings. And this is very helpful if you're using cloud formation, Yamal or Jason. The other thing I want to share is that, uh, if you're using JSON files, Then it's always good to use JSON when you're running the CDK guard, because in the Yamal, the intrinsic extensions like exclamation, those are sometimes don't work very good. So the JSON format is very good for, uh, using the cloud formation guard. And with the toolkit. This is how it shows. Whatever errors you have with the, uh, YAML configuration in the stack, it will just highlight with the squiggly blue lines and within the stack, so you don't have to run anything. So this is very helpful if you are using the YAML files. Then, uh, my favorite is the MCP tools. And now AWS, uh, Quiro has made it very easy to install MCP servers from Quiro.Dev website. So all the weighted MCP servers are listed on the Quiro.dev, and earlier there used to be documentation server, AWS API server. So now there is one unified AWS MCP server that can be installed in one single click and enabled from Kiiro. And earlier, it used to be very difficult to share MCP files across your team because of the tokens, so you had to redact those, uh, token variables and share it across the teams. But now with the support for environment variables in hero, you don't have to do that. You can share your MCP JSON files within your team. It simplifies the team development. And when another team member uses it, it asks for the confirmation that you have to approve that environment variable locally on your site and then, uh, run it. So my favorite is the diagrams one. And earlier, I used to take an hour to create the draw IO diagram, architecture diagram, but now with diagrams MCP it's less than a minute to generate the architecture diagrams. So there are also other, uh, useful MCP servers like the Headless Chrome Dev Tools browser. So it runs the, it's very useful for debugging the UI. It runs, uh, the, uh, Chrome Dev tools and finds the errors for you, and the agent then can do the debugging. It's very useful for the front-end applications. Then the last one is the Kro CLI, which is the rebranding of the QCLI. And as you know, context is the king in Coding assistance. So whenever if I have a large code base, after 4 to 5 prompts, I see my context fills up 100%, and then I have to start from scratch again. So how do I solve this problem? So one solution is the custom agents. With the custom agents, you can create dedicated agents for a reviewer agent, like, uh, architecture agent, a compliance agent, and with the specialized agents, your context is heavily, it's optimized, and you don't run out of the context window. So there's a two-step process using uh Kro CLI for creating custom agents, using slash agent create command, and then it will prompt you for the JSO for the configuration for that, uh, agent. So what is the agent configuration? It's just a JSON file where you have to give the name of the MCP server that you are going to use for the agent and the prompt. And the steering files, that's it. So if you're working on the front end, use the front end, uh, MCP server like the Chrome Dev Tools MCP server. You don't have to pass all the MCP servers that will take up your context. So that's a very efficient way of, uh, using, uh, custom agents. And launching the custom agents is just a single command. So with delegate launch, it will launch that agent in the background. And then do its task and then report back the status, so. Then, uh, you can continue with your next task. The second version to run these agents is, uh, using slash agent swap command, which I haven't shown here. And with that, the agent comes in the foreground and then it will be the default agent and you can, uh, work on that, uh, code review agent or the compliance agent. So I end up with a famous quote from Henry Ford, who transformed the automobile industry just like Qiro is transforming the financial services and industry and any other industry for AI agentic AI coding. Finally, here's, uh, my QR code. For the GitHub repot on the top right. Feel free to scan it. It has all these examples shared in the demo, and connect with me on LinkedIn, and, uh, I'm available, uh, at the back after this, uh, talk. So, I would love to hear about your experiences with, uh, Quiro and, uh, how you, how you use Quiro for your projects. And, uh, remember to, uh, complete the session survey in the app, that really helps the team. Thank you.
