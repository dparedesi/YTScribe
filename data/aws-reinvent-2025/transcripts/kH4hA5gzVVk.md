All right, so good morning everyone. I hope everyone is enjoying Las Vegas, uh, the keynote, and welcome to our session here this morning, which is exactly this digital transformation excellence using AWS Agentic AI taking you from vision, uh, to victory. I'm Brad Semenko. I'm in professional, uh, services with AWS and a team called Expert Services where I run the migration and modernization team. And we do some of the largest migrations in the world with some of the largest household names that uh many of you may be heard of and perhaps some of you are in the room today. I'm joined by uh Oscar Rodriguez who leads a team. We have domain practices across migration and modernization, data, enterprise transformation and supply chain. And together we're changing the world with some of these customers that I speak about. Speaking of which, we've invited Ahi Shekhar back this year from Danske Bank, and he's going to speak about some of the progress that they've achieved last year and that they are experiencing this year from a migration and modernization perspective. So let's get started. Here's what's happening today with this new technology. I've been doing this for quite some time at AWS and with all things being agentic AI, what we are experiencing is migrations occurring on average about 10x faster than traditional approaches, and today we're going to speak about that and what that means 10x faster is an 80 to 90% cost reduction in terms of how we staff and we deliver projects for our customers from a migration and modernization experience. Nope. So the challenge and the opportunity, no question, it's significant. As a matter of fact, 70% of the workloads that we are migrating were built and developed and tested and deployed anywhere from 20 to 30 years ago. Think about the complexities that is involved with that legacy software, legacy hardware, legacy systems and processes, people in some cases who may not even be available or who have documented those previous platforms that is a challenge that we experience and that you experience every single day. Think about it, 70% of the IT landscape that we operate, that we manage, that we deploy still on premises with a lot of contingencies and a lot of associated legacy to that. So these days we actually need AI, we need automation tools to help our customers accelerate, uh, their journey to the cloud. So there's no question. We are at an inflection point with some of the things that Matt announced this morning at the keynote and that's some of the things that we are going to speak about today. Things are clearly different and this is not a future trend. These are things that are happening now. As a matter of fact, we're seeing that 15%. Of day to day technical and business decisions by the year 2028 will be made autonomously with AI 15% of those, and what that means is machine learning, machine reasoning through complex situations, building a plan for that complex situation, often a migration and modernization, and then executing against that plan and delivering the goods, doing the actual migration and learning from that experience. 15% of those decisions will be made we believe by 2028 and that is clearly changing and accelerating everything I spoke about. As a matter of fact, 82% of organizations today are just beginning to leverage AI for the things that you do. Those early adopters, you will be the ones who make a difference, to take share, to have competitive advantage and achieve some of the visions to victory, uh, to rename the title that you would like to achieve within your career and within your organization. So we're going to speak about a lot of these things today about gaining a a significant advantage for how we do this. One of the things I've learned working with in a large cloud provider is customers want both. They do want to move their systems to the cloud, whether it's dev, test, staging, or even production systems to the cloud, but they also want to take advantage of AI, not only to help. Them achieve that migration, but once the estate is on AWS to actually realize and expand their portfolio with AI capabilities on AWS, and we're gonna speak about how we do both of that introduce purpose built work workloads, AWS Transform. Oscar is going to speak about that and also some no code solutions, quick suite and how customers are actually realizing this experience again with some of the things that Ashish is doing within his organization. Now a lot of people say that this AI thing is, oh, the beginning of the end, you know, I actually believe, to quote Winston Churchill, I think we're at the end of the beginning. There is no question things are going to change with some of the technologies that were introduced over the last 6 months from an AI perspective, but this industry is changing very quickly and so is the way I approach my customers from a migration and modernization perspective. So let's talk about that. Look, digital transformation is more than just just a technology, excuse me. It involves people, process, technology, and governance. I'm not trying to make this more complex, but how many of you have actually done coding with AI? Just a show of hands, just so I can get an understanding and accelerating your coding. OK, it looks like about 40 to 50% of the room is doing that. Do you notice that when you use something like Quiro or QTrans or or what have you, an AI tool that it does optimizations for the code? You start with prototyping and then you might get these one line procedure calls that are calling the same procedures that you wrote years ago and it's called optimization and that happens when you start to prototype, that happens when you start to build and then turn that into a production process. I know this because I have 16,000 lines of my own code in an application that I'm working on, but imagine if you had hundreds of millions of lines of code. What I'm discovering and what I'm seeing with my customers as developers, you are becoming two types of skill set people necessary one, writing perfect prompts to build the applications and source code that you want. And two, when you have to go back and realize and debug some of those situations, yeah, you've got to look at the source code and do that. So your skills are actually. Expanding, so that's what I mean about the end of the beginning because things are changing the way AI is introducing uh some of this. But if you do this properly again, this is how doing it properly we believe you can experience 10x rapid migration to AWS, 10x more rapid migration to ABS with significant cost savings. So let me be very clear on the expectations that we're going to share with you today. This isn't theoretical. We're gonna show you real world practical examples using the tools, customer experiences, and most importantly, the end results that you and our customers are experiencing with these tools. There's no question, it is definitely changing. So we want you to understand how agentic AI can reduce your timelines, how it can be introduced as a technology into your daily processes, and how you can use this to leverage a migration and modernization all the way to adopting new systems and new capabilities within your organization. Look, in my role and my team's role in our organizations, I speak to at least 1 customer per day, at least. Sometimes it's 2, sometimes it's 3. This week it'll probably be 15. The trends you notice they're they're kind of similar. What about my staffing? How do I introduce this? What about my legacy? What about the complexity? Where do I start? What do I do? Yeah, these are common questions, common situations, and common experiences that customers are on the threshold of, of trying to understand. How do I train my people? How do I drive scale? Ashish will talk about a hackathon that he's introduced where thousands of agents are being created within the organization, and a fluency of how to introduce agentic AI is, is being approached with an example. I know personally within our team we do a, we did quite a few manual processes for running. A program to help customers off of legacy systems. I had some of my best migration subject matter experts in the world, my SMEs, working on these projects, doing things like level of effort, the LOE, writing the customer proposal, doing the. As built a state analysis, I don't staff for that anymore. Now what we do is we automate the assessment, we automate the inventory, we come up with a wave plan. We even build out the VPC, the virtual private cloud, on AWS, and we automate that experience. And what we're finding is our staffing models, the way we change our delivery, our proposals, and our implementation timelines to customers, yeah, it is coming in at a 10x experience, faster experience. And Ashish will talk about this, uh, a little bit later on in terms of their environment representative perhaps of many of you. A mainframe migration takes anywhere from 10 to 15 years, 10 to 15 years, hundreds of millions of lines of code, up to 500 in some cases, or doing an enterprise migration of your infrastructure, Windows, SQL Server. Oscar's gonna demonstrate some of that, Linux servers, how do you move that? Well, often we're seeing. 24 to 36 months to do these migrations and again if we can reduce that timeline and eliminate some of those costs and manual experiences, that's what customers are asking for and that's what we're doing our best to deliver. So we talked about some of this last year in terms of the human process, the human experience to build consistency in how we deliver these migration and modernization projects. And basically what we would do in the old days is come up with a level of effort, we'd build one pod who was demonstrable and representative of the task ahead to go migrate a specific wave, come up with a wave plan for those servers and deliver the goods, do the migration. And then we would staff up more pods to drive scale. OK, that worked and we got some of the largest migrations in the world completed in a couple of years. Now what's changing is we introduced hyper-automation last year, we spoke about that last year, and now on top of that, we're doing the generative AI automation with many of the tools. That Matt spoke about this morning ranging from purpose built tools AWS Transform that is meant for migration and modernization. It's a tool to do that transformation for you and do those things assess your infrastructure, build out the network, build out the wave plan, and you just literally click and move servers. Then there's no code experiences. Think QuickS Suite where you can take all of that data and ask it difficult questions. How am I doing? How's my budget? How am I tracking? How many more people do I need? And it synthesizes that from a no code perspective. Or you can write Far or write Hello World and AI by using something like Quiro to completely, uh, re-platform your legacy applications that maybe cannot be migrated, and it's that entire suite of tools that we employ as professional services to move our customers to AWS. So I'm not trying to make this more complex than it is. I know we showed some pretty fantastic demonstrations this morning of showing how easy it is. This is the approach pattern that we take and it's not for everyone. Many customers, they already have the business analysis of why are we doing this? We're gonna save money, we're gonna lower costs, we're gonna eliminate data centers, got it. We don't need the business plan for that. What about the overall framework and the governance of roles and responsibilities and maybe extending some of that work to partner teams or staff teams? What about training people? And remember some of those issues that I talked about when I'm debugging my 16,000 lines of code or 150 million lines of code uh for, for a customer. Measure twice and cut once is what I say. Think carefully about how you're going to introduce AI into and unleash it onto your code base because your developers, your business analysts, your business users often will have to look through two lenses one, writing the perfect prompts to do the work of the migration and modernization, and two, perhaps you got a step. Back into the code and do some debugging and write the code and that's a very common experience. So the point is if you have a framework to address these challenges and approach it not too aggressively and not too slowly, this is the experience we're seeing is a 3X faster delivery speed cutting our implementation costs by 5%. And at the same time introducing AI into the organization to enable you so we can get out of the way from a delivery perspective and enable you to leverage your platform for what it's meant to do drive new market share, serve customers better, and lower your costs and do this in uh on an AWS cloud platform leveraging the capabilities of AI. So let's look at some of the practical approaches and mechanisms and processes that we use. You'll find those in the middle. Everyone's asking us, help us accelerate our migration by at least 50%. That's a conversation I do have every day. Improve my workplace productivity. What I'm doing right now is mapping products and services to this. I think AWS transformed to do the work on the left hand side, purpose-built AI capabilities, quick suite to do some of these automated business workflows literally with no code. You can drag and drop all the documents you wish and ask difficult questions and come up with business and technical decisions all the way to doing rapid prototyping with something like Quiro on the right hand side. And and rebuild or reimagine and recreate applications in new and more productive ways that are easier uh to debug because there's a lot less code going on. So this is the process assess, execute, and scale and what we like to do with uh our customers spend some time on on the assessment how difficult is this going to be, what's the challenge, what's the forecast cost model, both from an implementation and an operational perspective. And then we staff up a few people to do the work. If you do not have the skills, we're here to help you and here to help you achieve and and realize some of those goals. So for the remainder of our time together, 55 minutes, we're going 45 minutes, pardon me, we're gonna demonstrate some of these and talk about some real world uh customer examples. So I'll invite my colleague Oscar Rodriguez on stage to go through many of these examples with you. Uh, thank you, thank you Oscar. Thank you, Brad. Uh, everyone, great to see you. Welcome to Rembend and also thank you for joining us today. I know there are multiple options available, so we're super happy to have you here. So let me start with introducing myself. My name is Oscar Rodriguez. I'm a director at AWS and I lead the global practice for export services. Brad is part of my team. So the role of my team is to help some of the largest customers across the globe. So if you have a. Big problem, we have the people that to support those problems. You are going through, like, a digital transformation, we have people that can support you, so feel free to reach out to us anytime and we are here to support you. So the first part I wanna focus on is on the So how is AWS helping customers to do the real transformations? There are many tools available, but let me start with the AWS transform. AWS Transform is the first set of agents that we have developed over the last years to help customers to do large migrations modernizations. AWS, we have been doing migrations for almost 20 years. This is nothing new. What we have done is we have bring all the different practices, lessons learned as far as how can we do code analysis, how can we do large implementations, and we learned from customers there are 4 main areas where customers, they need help. That's the main capabilities of AWS firm. Number 1, VMware migration. Many of the customers that are reaching out to us, they want to exit from VMware. They want to move to other place. So we have you covered. The second one is fully stack, Windows modernization. We have many customers. They are trapped into the fact that they may have a license of Microsoft .NET, SQL Server, and Windows. So we have now available we have those capabilities available today for Windows organization. And the third one is mainframe, which is also as she is going to cover this, uh, later on. We have massive number of customers that are looking for how can they modernize the mainframe. So how can they move fast. They don't want to go through a traditional approach, so AS transform does provide those capabilities. And the last one, probably you saw from the keynote, now we have the ability to do the custom transformations, which is something that uh think about in mind that you have a cobalt and there was a program that was written 25 years ago, and now you wanna move to uh Java or .NET. But maybe you will have an application in Java, and now you might want to move to DubNET. So we're giving the options to customers to have that flexibility. So but what is really the most important part of AWS transform? It can help you to compress those timelines. So the migration project that maybe some companies, they are thinking about like uh 5 years, 7 years, with AWS transform, you can bring it down. But let's walk through one scenario as far as Windows. This is the actual typical customer that may have uh Microsoft stack. You have probably Microsoft .NET, SQL Server and also Windows running on a virtual machine. With the AWS transform, we can help you, number one, to migrate from Microsoft .NET to .NET Core open source, which is something that uh is a new capability available, uh. This week. The second part, which is also that's one of the most exciting parts, is migrating from SQL Server to what we call Amazon Aurora postre SQL. So how many of you trying to, like, a large data migration and you're really worried about how can you take care of this? So we have you covered today transform. But let's go let's go deeper on the data. If you can can raise your hand, how many of you have done, like, a data migration in the room? So probably like 50% of the room. And probably, as you know, data migration is the hardest part of any transformation. You call it in the cloud, outside of the cloud. So what we have done with SQL Server to AuroraPostres is really simplify and makes life easier for for any company. There are 4 steps. Number one, we can help you with the analysis. So you have think about you have maybe a massive number of databases you want to analyze. You want to understand what are the dependencies. Who is using those applications is part of the discovery analysis that we have available. Second one, we can help you also to analyze this er schemas, as well also we can help you to move the data itself, which is the hardest part, moving the data from a massive number of systems that you have all the way up to Aurora. And the third part, which is also super important, is the procedures. Many of the customers that we're working on, they have massive logic running some procedures. So how do you ensure that those logic is now available in the new system? And the last but not least, is the validation and the deployment. In my experience, sometimes the only thing that we we wanna focus on the deployment and we forget about, you know, how do we making sure that the data is er has the right integrity, security, so we can help you with all of this end to end. But also it's it's not just the Windows part of the SQL Server mainframe. This is probably over the last 6 months, we have seen a major high demand in terms of mainframe mobilizations customers, and the reason why is because customers are looking for a systematic approach. They don't want just a piece of meal. So what we offer is we can help you with the code analysis. The second part, which is one of my favorite capabilities, we can do reverse engineer. Look at the code and also based on that, create create automated documentation for you. Think about some of the rules that maybe were written 10 years ago or 20 years ago. We have you covered. And number 3 is the code is composition, which is uh we're gonna see an example in a second, is Think about if you have a large monolithic application. How can you break it down in business domains or even microservices? And the migration planning, which is many customers reaching out to us, Oscar, Brad, what is the best way to migrate? How many waves do we want to have as part of the planning? And then the last part, which is also important, is make a decision. Should I re-factor? Meaning I'm gonna take the legacy logic and redesign my application or reimagine. Remagine is a new concept that is happening right now. It's a major factor is where really companies they they have the option to really redesign the model, redesign the logic moving forward, and the last part is test and deploy. So one of the We have multiple case studies. This is a real case study from er Toyota Motors. So when they reached out to us, what was the challenge? They asked the challenges. They were running like a large mainframe system. They didn't have enough mainframe skills. Some of the people that wrote the application, they're no longer with the company. But also, the massive number of lines of code were very impressive. More than 40 million lines of code. All of this so they look at different options and they came up with the conclusion that AWS transform was the only option that can do the code analysis, help them really to understand the complexity. Also helped them to really do the decomposition. So what was the main result? They were able to really compress the timelines. Looking at the numbers, the data we're looking more than like 50% of times faster from a traditional approach. The second part, which is a major benefit, is they were able to identify what was the logic, what is the technical depth, what are the things that we need to modernize, and what are the things that we need to throw away. You look at the quote from the Brian Corsa, who is the CTO who so he literally said every transform has done what many said was impossible. They look at different options. Something that I I highly recommend for you. Give it a shot. If you're going through a transformation, you will be very surprised with the results. But digital transformation is not just migrations, modernizations. Something that also we see from customers. Customers are looking for, how can I improve productivity? So to that end, we recently released Amazon Quick Suite, or also you can call it Amazon Quick, as you heard this morning from Matt Garman. Something that is coming as a major features that we have available. Number one is the ability to bring data in one single place. And make decisions in real time. Probably some of you heard about the customer 360 concept, CRMs, bringing all data in one place. So what is the difference? The difference is you can bring data that maybe is running on Excel, it's on salesforce.com, data maybe is available in other agents. Once you bring this data through QuickSuite, now you can start asking questions and getting responses in a matter of seconds versus hours. The second part is something that I use personally. With Quickweed, you also think about, like, your coach and mentor. So how many times you're trying to make a decision and you wanna see what are the options, what are the pros and cons. So Quick Seed can be also your mentor. That's something that I use um on a day to day basis to help me to make decisions. And the last part is it's not just to get insights, but also to trigger some actions. How many times you've been in a situation where you're making a decision and you have to trigger a workflow? Maybe the workflow needs to fix a problem. Maybe it needs to send an email to someone. So right now, there's no way unless You can start doing some custom automations. So to that end, our 2nd 3rd scenario I want to cover is the automation of the business workflows. But I wanna I want to show you this is a real example we are building for a customer. Think about this customer. They have a it's a large bank and they're looking for so how can they automate the document validation? And er as part of this, er, long process. So we're gonna see here first what is the data we need? We need the driver's license, so we're gonna drop the drag and drop the data. Uh, we're gonna also the same for a formal application. So this is a process right now. It's for purposes. This demo is we just Drag and drop. As soon as we click start, the system is gonna kick off a massive igantic workflow that is gonna be number one, as you see, it's gonna start parsing the data. It's gonna identify what data is missing. It's gonna identify and apply some of the rules. So there are multiple agents that are happening and those agents are happening in parallel. Once the data is ready, so one of the last steps that will happen is the actual validation per se. So the validation is not just a simple validation as comparing data. The system behind this thing is gonna apply some business rules, but also it's gonna identify, is there any potential fraud? Is this driver's license is really real or this is a fake license? So that's all of this will happen and we're gonna see just in a few seconds. The validation is done and the system is telling us, here is the discrepancies, here are the matches, but also something that um I was surprised when I saw this one working. Right now we're talking about only one person. The same process can be applicable for hundreds, thousands of millions of records of personnel running in parallel. The second part, the system has the intelligence to keep learning. So it's not just a typical workflow. As the data continues, you will continue learning as we go. Um, and the last part, which is also super important, is Where is the human? There's a human in the loop at this point. The person probably, what are the options? The options will say, I need to request further information. Or I may decide to go and uh approve the application, regardless of the human also continue in the loop, and that's where you guys can uh your people can bring the the highest value. We cover different use cases, but one of the areas that is really moving super fast is How companies are transforming their environments using the uh agentic AI for software development life cycle. And Quiro is, you know, how many of you before we start, how many of you have used Quiro so far? 30%. So my suggestion is, I would love, by the end of this week for everyone in this room to use Quiro and uh give us your feedback. Uh, as of today, and probably the numbers have changed after the keynote, we have almost 300,000 subscribers in lonely few months. 300,000 subscribers. So but what is Quiro? Quo probably you may say, Oscar, there are many tools in the market. Um, absolutely. Probably like hundreds of thousands of tools available. So Quito is the first Agenti KI ID that is fully connected with AWS. So that's #1. Number 2, when you look at the software development life cycle, so you have to go through probably, like requirements, you go through a design, you have to go through implementation. So Quiro is fully embedded as part of this. Let me just give you an example. In one of the customers, they were They were trying to build an application, but they didn't have the requirements. They didn't have the design. So what we did is just get in a room, gather the requirements, and after the session in less than a few hours, we were able to create the requirements document and a technical design for the customer using Kilo. And the story didn't end there. So the customer, the one that said, well, anyone can create a document. Can you show me the app? One day after we showed the prototype to a customer. So again, Quiro is the second capability that provides fully embedded, and you guys will see more coming up. But what are the main three areas where Quiro can help you? Number 1, build a new application. It could be a prototype, but you can take that prototype all the way to production. But most important is you may say, well, I'm not a technical person. So Quito has the ability also to connect with you using the NLP, natural language. I have seen many people that are not technical, also ramping up with Quiro and building applications. The second one is if you have an application, you may say, well, I already spent 6 months, 1 year building an app. But I don't know if the app is ready. What is the technical depth? So you can bring also Quiro to really refine, reassign your applications. One of the other customers that I'm working on is the they shared the code with us. It was really hard for us to understand the logic. So what we use Quote is to create the auto documentation and also simplify the weight the number of functions during the er er the code, right? But the last part, which is something that uh you know, pretty soon I'm gonna hand it over to Aishi. Combining AS transform and Quiro. As I described, AWS transform is you have a massive VMware mainframe application as an example. So it can help you really to automate a lot of things, but there are things that also you may need to have uh the human in the loop, but also you need someone that can help you to finalize. So combining Amas, AWSR and Front and Quiro, it will be the best way to go. But let's walk through them. We have hundreds of demos. This is a demo that we built for another A bank in this case, what I'm asking you is, I want to create a banking app. And uh I want the application to be in Spanish, and I want the look and feel. I'm just gonna give a link. This is the title sheet. So let's let's walk through this together. So at this point, I'm just saying, Quiro, can you create a A banking app with some validation, right? That's all that I'm telling you, right? So Quiro is kicking off multiple agents. Uh, those agent is gonna be looking at what are the rules, what do I need to have. It's gonna look at the application that I refer, and then in a few seconds, you're gonna see the app, the prototype up and running in Quiro, right? Obviously, this is just a prototype. We have also implemented something very similar for a For a customer in just 3 weeks. And the customer, the original plan was to get the application in 3 months. So we went from 3 months to 3 weeks using Quiro. Again, there's a highly potential and this is just the beginning. Uh, probably also, as you saw on the keynote today, there are other capabilities that are available right now. They're coming up with Kino, as far as the valve, security, and so on. So you can bring those as well. But before I hand it over to Ashish, I wanna just close with something very important. It's uh AWS we have an end to end portfolio for genic EI. So today we talk about quito, quick sweet or quit. AWS transform. So there are some of the options for you. But also we have different customers. They're coming to me and say, Oscar, we want to build our own we don't want to use Quiro. We want to use, uh, Agent Core. We want to use some of the open-source using EKs. Absolutely. That's the second tier that we have available. But also we have customers that want to build their own models. So in that level, Also, from an infrastructure point of view, you can we have you covered through SessionMaker and some of the major announcements that came up coming on this week. So my guidance to you as you start planning the session this week, look at this map and see where you wanna focus, but also, once you're back to your company, also try to map, take this map and see. Where you are, what is the rightness, what are the tools that you want to use moving forward? So with that, I'm gonna hand it over now to Ashishish Shekhar, senior vice president for Danske Bank. He is head of the he's managing all the technology platforms across the bank, and uh he's gonna show us how Danske Bank has been disrupting the industry and how Danske Bank is innovating using GAI and Agent AI. With that, Ashish, thank you for joining us. Thank you, Oscar. It's an absolute pleasure to be here today with, uh, with all of you. So Oscar and Brad talked quite a bit about the technologies that are available and, uh, and here and now. But we're in the privileged position that we've been co-innovating on some of these technologies for some time together with AWS. So we can share a little bit about what does this actually look like in action, when you put all of this together, what does that look like? A little bit about us. So I'm here representing Danske Bank. We're a, we're a 150 year old institution, lots of amazing legacy behind us, uh, but that comes with its own challenges. We've also been building things for close to that, that time. We have a large presence, so we have over 3 million customers, 21,000 staff, so you can imagine that the challenges that we work with are going to be very similar to many of, many of your organizations. We're not, uh, we're not terribly big, but we're also not terribly small. We're highly regulated. So our starting point in this journey was not dramatically different to what many of you will experience in your um organizations. What, what does that look like? Roughly about 18,000 VMs in terms of infrastructure, about 80,000 containers, 25 petabytes of data. And that is kind of where we started, um, about a year and a half-ish ago. So why should you listen to it and why is our story worth telling? Well, A little bit of what we've been able to achieve. Now we're not perfect, but whatever we're doing seems to be working, so there's there's a few things we could potentially take away from here. We've been orchestrating a cloud migration for some time trying to get our estate over into AWS so that we can leverage all of the capability that becomes available on AWS. We've been able to do it 6 times faster than the next fastest in this in this scale. We're one of the leaders in uh agentic AI usage across the bank. We've been climbing the ranks quite steadily, and we've climbed a number of places in the use of agentic AI across some global indexes, so that seems to be working as well. We're now moving from experimentation. So we started our journey with Agentic AI a few years ago, like many people would have when the, with the advent of the, the original GPTs. But now we're going from what used to be experiments of 2 to 300 different experiments going on across the organization to concentrating our effort and making some very large investments into very strategic places. What, why is that? Because we now believe that there is no more proof required for this technology to be adopted. We believe that the technology is there, it's driving lots of values, so we have to take bigger steps, more meaningful steps, put some meaningful operation behind some critical elements. We're doing that now. Finally, recently we sort of maybe about we've run a few hackathons, but With the technological pace that we've been able to achieve and where we are now in our journey, we were able to run a hackathon which was participated by about 50 to 60 teams across the organization and we built over 600 agents in uh in the space of 2 days. A bunch of those we actually promised that we will take to production and some of them are now running in production over the last few hackathons. So how do you get to this and how do you get there? As I mentioned, we started with uh a very complex technology estate that we were running. But we've been able to do some really, really cool things. Over the last 15 months, we have moved 850 of our applications out of just over 1000 into the cloud. Now that is a staggering pace and when we say. We move something we move we we mean it really is moved all non-production environments, all production environments, all firewall rules, all CMD record updates, all the DNS repointing, all of the on-prem assets cleaned up is what our definition of done is. So when we move, there's nothing more to do. At pace, that was about April May time frame, in one single month, we ended up moving 150 applications from 0 all the way through to full production in cloud. And typically this is done with, you know, hundreds of people formed in like 1020, 30 squads, um, is, is the way these migrations work. We were able to do it with two squads in operation. And we've talked a lot about this. We, we were able to do this only because we have automated. Nearly 100% of the of the migration. We've automated everything from notifications going out to cust uh to our um application owners to change records being created to DNS rules getting updated to DNS TDLs being lowered to replication starting automated, uh, working out when things should start taking a full snapshot of VMs before we move them, all of it. It's reduced our manual effort by a dramatic amount and helped us move at pace. It's very doable, and the time is now to be able to do it. Now without going into too much detail. We're not stopping there. We're progressing even further. We're now applying lots of agentic AI to accelerate this even further. I can only wish that the capabilities that are available to us now. We were available to us about 12 months ago. One small example of this. We recently, and when I say recent, probably about 2-3 months ago, put a new agent into production assisting our migrations. So what happens is, as I mentioned, at scale we're moving hundreds of applications in a, in a month and, and only 2 squads. You can imagine that those 2 squads are not moving the applications. They're only responsible for handling the ones that fail. There'll always be some failures. So it's only by exception that humans um and the squads actually get involved. Now the reason they get involved when something fails, it's obviously out of the norm, and these things can obviously then be very complex when we've ended up automating 2 to 4000 steps in the migration process when something fails, it's a complex problem. It's not usually a straightforward thing that we could have picked up, uh, because otherwise we would have automated it anyway. We built an agent So what what happens now is when something does fail rather than the case getting handed over to a human team, it actually gets handed over to an agent. And the agent first does all the deciphering, all of the working out of what the problem may have been, does a whole bunch of troubleshooting itself, and then comes up with the most plausible solution for, uh, uh, for how to, how to remediate the problem. What we're seeing is what was already low error rates is cut down by 5%. Our triage times are getting to a problem cut down by about 70-80%. It's absolutely incredible what this can do, and this is the base of where we are. This can only get better from here. There was a, there was a very, very interesting, uh, um, specific incident that happened that I can talk a little bit about. So, uh, there were two applications that failed. We had two migration teams that were looking at one application independently, and they were trying to rack their brains or go, what is going on here? When they started looking at the output of the agent, sort of realized that the agents kind of talking about something that they didn't know, which is, hey, you know what, between these two applications that have failed. I can see that there is looking through the entire stack that there is actually a common disc component. Which for some reason was uh was not something that was picked up before in the in the process. The agent recommended squad one stop your work, squad two continue and fix the problem. The other one will just be fixed automatically. And lo and behold, that's exactly what happened. Now this could have happened definitely what would have otherwise happened, it was, we, we would have rolled back both the applications, done the analysis over a couple of days, figured out that this is the problem, then sorted it out, come back. This prevented that whole process from happening. And this is now operating very much in production and being used every day with our teams. We're expanding this to all incidents being covered in the bank. Any time there's an incident that happens, we'll get transferred over to an agent with all of the information that we've captured, being able to do meaningful analysis, come back with results, and being able to cut all of these, these, this time, the time that we're spending analyzing things and recovering things by a large amount. We also need to do obviously a tremendous amount of modernization. So it's great that we've been able to do the, the, uh the, the move, but what about the modernization? We'll talk about that in a second and also underpin everything we do with GEI. Just the sheer magnitude of what we can do with these things is incredible. All of the things that I just talked about are available in a technical blog. There's multiple things we've done. I'm gonna stop here for a second if you wanna pull, pull your time, uh, phone out, get the QR code. You will be able to reference these things. They're published in, uh, in blogs on, uh, on, on AWS already. And The amazing part about all of this is this is systems that that we built and existed about 12 months ago, but now this is, this has been made even more powerful with the AWS transform pieces that Oscar was talking about. So I can only wish if that was available to us uh then it would be amazing, but to you it is now, so you should be able to do this even faster than we've been able to do and, and I, and I can't wait to see where this goes. But here's the thing now we've talked a lot about the distributed estate. But most organizations like ours, there is this big behemoth mainframe, right? And it's quite a lot more prevalent in large organizations that we care to admit. So what about that? It's amazing that we can move all of these applications, but core data of the bank, some of the core applications of the bank sit in this thing that has been serving us really well for a good 30-40 years, but now. Is it really where we should be running everything that we have running now? We've increased latency on uh things that are running on AWS different technology sets, so we're having to maintain not only a core set of uh of skill sets on the mainframe but also on on the cloud. So there is that thing and there is of course, yes, being able to move things faster is really good, but what about modernization or even from the mainframe if we start to move things, I mean there's the problem has been solved before, but what does that actually look like now and what does that mean? So, It's important to see why is it that we wanna, we wanna optimize our mainframe estate. Why don't we just keep running everything the way it is? Well, It will not be a surprise to anyone. There's a massive shrinking pool of skill sets and capability in this space now. We have amazing amounts of Java developers, .NET developers in the bank, Go developers, you name it. But mainframe development is a shrinking pool set and shrinking skill set, very hard to work with. Growing knowledge gaps we're having to maintain multiple um skill sets across the bank, legacy system constraints, everything that comes around we have business logic buried in uh in PL1 and cobalt code. With people who are sort of leaving the bank now, things have been running amazingly. One of the best things about the mainframe is backwards compatibility, but that is also the thing that holds us back. We have a number of components, pieces of software running on our mainframe that are good 30, 40 years old, right? Runs amazingly, but nobody understands it. That's a hard problem to solve and getting worse by the day. Lots of data in the uh in the mainframe setup further away from uh from all of our distributed application state, not a place we wanna be. Innovation like we're building all of these generative AI applications everywhere. We're leveraging AWS technology to do all of that. But not on the mainframe different legacy tool set legacy, um, I can say code. There's things that we could do, but all of that requires modernization requires also to be to be able to move, so the imperative to do something about it is very much there. So we started with a few core principles in mind some time ago, right? Number one, the problem has been solved. The people have been moving applications out of the mainframe to elsewhere. So what's new about this, right? The core issue with the way this was done previously for a very long period of time is a rules-based set up, so very, very hardly defined targets, but the amount of quote unquote human in the loop required at the end of a rules-based conversion is actually very high. This is a high effort problem, and that translates to the 10 to 15 years that um that Brad was talking about and Oscar was talking about. It's simply not time we have. 15 years later, the world would be a completely different place. We would have gone through 3 corporate cycles. Being able to stick through that is an incredibly hard problem and also one that is very hard to invest into if you only see results like 1015 years later, big problem, right? So we wanted to do it differently, we wanted to do it not the way it has been done before. Now, innovation with agentic AI is obvious. It is so much, I think a lot of what Oscar talked about is capability available to Australia, so it made sense for us to use that. How do we use that to do that different? Third, this is obviously we're trying to do something that has not been done in the way we're trying to do it before, so proving value early was extremely important. We can't be in a situation where in our organizations we're trying to build something for 12 months and only then you can see a piece of value come out too hard. Finally, it had to be a solution that scales well across the entire organization. It's not enough to be able to hand crank a pilot out or a POC out and then hope that it'll it'll scale. So we took two of relatively complex applications. Now, obviously these are not core banks, but these are also not POCs. These are not small. These are applications, a fee application and direct debit application underpinning some core parts of our business, right? It was not enough for us to take something relatively small and convert it because that would not mean anything. One of these applications, so some of these, one of these applications is supporting our mortgage lending operations in, uh, in the Nordics, and the other one is, uh, is supporting a direct debit system, right? Some things are pretty common about these things. Both of these applications have been written 20 to 30 years ago. They've been evolved a little bit, but very little. One written in cobalt, one written in PL1. Um, the other common thing about this is very, very limited skill set and SME knowledge available in the bank to be able to work with it, right? But some things were quite different. Now traditional approaches on converting these applications and moving them over rely on a fixed target. Most converters go into Java, or rather sort of Jobal. It's not even really Java, right? And that is not a space that we want to be. We don't want to move from cobalt to Job. We also don't want to move into. The area that owns the fee application. Operates mostly in a .NET skill set. Now we don't wanna introduce an application that is full blown Java, which means we've got to operate with a with with another skill set in the same team, right? So we wanted a target from cobalt to .NET. The other one, on the other hand, they already operate in Java. So it's a it's a PO1 to Java, right? So it's a very targeted, it's not enough to be able to convert to a static target because it has to match the organizational setup that we have, otherwise we just simply increase cost and capture us ourselves into another legacy. So that is what we set out to do. Now how do you do it? There's a few different approaches that can be taken. There's obviously reforge setups. There's re-platform setups, but the hardest of them all is when you go from a complete legacy into a full modern space. Now we said if we're gonna try and do this, the proof, it has to be for the hardest ecosystem, and that is what we went for. We went for going from Cobalt PL on these two applications using, well, building together and then using the Amazon transform ecosystem to extract business rules with high accuracy and very, very low human overhead. Now we wanted to use a little bit of a human in the loop just to confirm things, but this process had to be low overhead because otherwise we can't block our entire organization from doing what they're doing now. But once we've done that, and that actually works extremely well, to our surprise with the technology available to us now, the accuracy rates are really, really high. Second, we take that and we pump it through all of the work that uh that is going on in, in the Kiro space. We do spectrum and development and build a brand new application that is going straight into a fully modernized space. One into a Java target, one into a .NET target. Now this is a great concept, but the great thing is we now have been able to prove and we put both of these applications into production 2 weeks ago. So it is now a very proven method that can be used and can be used to move forward. What are the advantages of doing it this way? We lower the effort on uh on our SMEs. We improve their productivity. Now remember that this is a very, very low available skill set, SMEs. We don't wanna be spending tons of their time just trying to revalidate everything that happens because they've got to run a business as well. Increase developer efficiency by a very, very large proportion. Preserving logic but with high accuracy, that is what takes time, like not getting the logic right and having to redo it is what elongates the time and increases effort, which translates into hundreds of millions of dollars being spent on this problem. Finally, highly regulated, so we need to make sure that we meet the regulation. You can pump all of these things as steers into the build of the application via cure and just works extremely well, and it will only get better from here. So what does all of that get us? 65% lower. Error rates compared to traditional approaches, not even compared to human directly compared to traditional machine approaches, 65% lower. Imagine the amount of money that uh that translates into. Mainframe applications are notorious for being monoliths and heavily interconnected. We lower the interdependency through this approach when we rebuild them by 75%. Hopefully increasing this even further. Reverse engineering, that is what takes all the time, the energy, the money, the effort lowered by 80% translating into further, um, SME, uh, input being lowered, right? Human effort being significantly lowered. For engineering building out the application from the business rules 4 times faster, 4 times faster. That translates literally from 10 to 15 years cutting down to potentially 4 to 55 to 7, depending on your state. We obviously run a very large state, but the mass effects of these things are transformative overall 60% migration, um, speed being faster. And we're just getting started. This can even, this, this will probably get significantly better from where it is now. A key few points, lessons learned, very, very important in this transformation journey for us. Educate, educate, educate number one. Without education of the entire skill set, um, without education of people, the adoption would be really low. Demystify, make this real for people. Put this in the hands of people, get them to try it, do the hackathons, get them to build things. Put, put the tools in front of people and let them see for it for themselves. The evidence gathered directly is the most beneficial for all humans. And I can't stress that enough. Give them paths to production. When you run a hackathon, being able to give people paths to production changes the game completely. People get a lot more excited being able to actually want to do that. Super important prove value early when you try and do things that have not been done before, it can also seem like something that is really far away. Avoid that prove it early. Go for some of the, the approaches, uh, um, in being able to pilot, being able to put things into production, but don't stop too early. Not POC is not enough. pilots are not enough actually going through a production, proving value super important finally. If you're going to try and do things that have not been done before, take some risks. Some risks are OK to take, and they change the game. They really, really, really help change the shape of how technological evolution is helping power our own future. And helping us maintain our lead in digital. Thank you so much. Thank you Ashish. Thank you Oscar. So just to summarize what we talked about today, I opened with some of the statistics of what some of the ambitions are, what some of the expectations are, and what some of the trends are. Oscar spoke about some real world services and products and solutions and capabilities and the framework that we use to help our customers accelerate their mission to the cloud, and then you saw Ashish with some real world practical examples of how this is done. I remember I flew to meet Ashish a couple of years ago when this thing was just getting started, and it is truly impressive to see how far we've come in such a short amount of time and this isn't. It's hard, but it's not impossible and getting started is probably the first step to take, and that means training your people, getting fluent with AI and what I really like about this entire story is it's a journey to the cloud and it's leveraging AI and it's introducing AI into your organization in a safe and sensible way, not about staffing up people and finding the right experts. It's using capabilities that are available to you today. So these stats are real. I think we demonstrated some of that today. Ashish is proving some of that today, and we certainly are just getting started with with many of you. So look, we have a lot of migration topics occurring throughout the week. We encourage you to build a really good map for things that are important to you and if you have any questions, we encourage you to connect with all of us. Take a quick snapshot of this one and the next slide is, is thanking you for our time and how to get a hold of us. These are our QR codes that will take you to our LinkedIn profiles and then we can just get started with the conversation, any questions or any follow-ups you have. We'll be taking questions outside of the room, uh, today. It's a pretty quick turn here because there's another session coming in. So we sincerely thank you for your time, thanking the speakers, and have a great week here at Las Vegas and Reinvent. Thank you so much.
