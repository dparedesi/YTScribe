summary: "This fireside chat features Nitesh Ambasta from LPL Financial (30,000 advisors, 8 million clients) and a host from Incedo discussing how AI and Cloud can modernize wealth management. Key themes include: 1) **AI for Advisor Personalization**: AI can handle 60-70% of advisor time spent on non-client-facing tasks (meeting prep, document collection), enabling personalization at scale via Agentic AI. 2) **Leapfrogging Legacy**: LPL can skip traditional product-building and go straight to agentic/AI-based models for banking, lending, and securities lending, closing the gap with wirehouses faster. 3) **Cost-to-Serve Transformation**: End-to-end workflow automation for account opening, KYC/AML, and commission processing can boost margins significantly. 4) **Data Foundation via M&A as Beachhead**: LPL used acquisitions (Prudential, Atria, Commonwealth) to migrate new data flows onto a modernized AWS-based 'Data Foundation' without disrupting legacy systems. 5) **Sequencing & Talent**: The 'hard yards' are data ecosystem readiness, security/trust, and talent transformation. Leaders must embrace AI themselves, and future hiring will shift towards ML engineering skills."

Good afternoon. Come on guys, good afternoon. Yeah, uh, very happy to be here with my good friend Nitesh Ambasta, uh, and we're going to be talking about, uh, modernizing wealth management, uh, using cloud and AI. Now wealth management is a very interesting, uh, space within financial services, highly profitable, uh, but from a technology perspective, I think it's fair to say has been a bit of a laggard. And that's, I think, an opportunity because with all the changes happening with cloud and now AI, there is a real opportunity to leapfrog, and what better, who better to talk about it than Nitesh. Natesh is an industry leader, senior leader at LPL Financial, and I know that this is something he's very passionate about. So Nitesh, we'll do it in 3 parts. OK, so it's about strategy to execution. It's about impact. So we'll cover the spectrum. We'll start with maybe laying out what is the opportunity here. Yeah, we'll start with that. We'll then get to the but part of it, you know, so you know that what are some of the challenges, and then we'll get to get to solutions all in the next 15 minutes, OK. Without further ado, let's start with the opportunity. The hero of the story for wealth managers are advisers. Yes, and everybody is trying to make the experience better for advisers. There has been this promise about adviser personalization, not fully delivered, but with AI, how do you see this playing out? How could you know AI transform the experience and the proposition for advisers? Yeah thank you thanks for that question. I think all of us are trying to figure that one out you know personalization is very easy if you have only one client and and if they don't change their mind ever then it's super easy but uh the hard part with personalization has been that uh. It's, it's an ecosystem. It's a system. It's not a feature or a product, right? It's a system and systems are messy, and the reason systems are messy is because clients are messy and not in a humorous way, but is a client of mine, yes, so you know that from experience, uh, I made everybody wait while I was running through the expo. So yeah, clients are messy, they change their mind, they have their preferences changing, and so on. And so personalization has been a challenge. And it continues to be a challenge. The, the part about personalization has always been that let's say you're an adviser and all these are your clients. If you try to personalize it for everyone, let's say you do it, everyone will have unique demands of you, and that is hard for an adviser to keep up with. And so where AI comes in is it takes the heavy lifting from advisor's plate. Today I think advisers spend 60 to 70%. Of their time preparing for meetings, collecting documents, and a lot of stuff that they are not spending time with clients, uh, and so that 60-70% is your attack space with AI. If you can get to that and then advisers can focus their time with customers and they can use their relationships better, that's the holy grail and so we'll see how far we can get to that but uh I think AI has all those promises with agentic AI we can automate a lot of that work that advisers are doing manually today or they have to spend their time doing. So that's very exciting that AI can take, you know, do a lot of the. Heavy lifting behind personalization. Let's get to the bigger picture that what does that imply from a business model perspective and maybe even putting the LPL hat on that where you play in the value chain and you know everybody's trying to in wealth management, you trying to be this financial kind of supermarket. So how could AI be a bit of a disruptor and maybe help you leapfrog? Is that a possibility? Yeah, definitely for LPL uh it's a possibility like we uh we were not advanced in a lot of products and feature capabilities like warehouses and LPL having 30,000 advisors affecting the financial well-being of about 8 million clients can definitely be that marketplace ecosystem. And you mentioned the word leapfrog. We do have that opportunity. We don't have to go through traditional models of building a banking lending product or traditional ways of creating sec lending desk. You can go straight to agentic and AI-based models. You can skip a generation. As LPL go straight to those opportunities that uh let's say existing players will take a long time to change their model. We we don't have anything so we can go straight to the target uh segment there. So that's an opportunity segment for opportunity space for us. How does that translate is. You know we have our own margin expansion targets and you and me were talking about like boards are excited about it all the management teams are excited about it. So the trick is to really figure out those use cases. You can't stop the hype, right? If you try to fight the hype curve, you will lose. So you have to pick and choose those areas where you can actually make a difference. AI clearly is very good at natural language, text, all of that use cases, and so you would want to deploy it there first and get some value, and then it becomes a flywheel. And so that's kind of the direction of travel we are after with AI at LPL um we definitely believe that we can uh leapfrog a generation and come close the gap with warehouses in terms of capabilities and features much faster. That's very exciting and you know you talked about customer experience. You talked about business model, and that eventually implies revenue and growth. Let's talk about the third big business KPI, which is cost, cost to serve, and you did mention margin earlier that cost to serve has also been a bit sticky in this industry. So how do you see AI really making a difference to the cost to serve? that's actually. An opportunity area where we can attack first and cost to serve has been on our radar for a while. And we have tried to make incremental progress in that space, but what is now possible is you can look at those end to end workflow steps in the cost to serve, like whether it is account opening workflows or commission processing workflows or simple money movement, how fast you can do those things. Today there are a lot of exception cases or even supervision use cases. There are so, so many human beings involved in an account opening account transfer kind of use cases. And those are ripe areas where you can say, OK, we can look at this as a completely inside out approach instead of incrementally making those workflows better, right? You don't have to do the typical workflow systems like our favorite workflow products from the past and say, hey, let's look at this completely differently. And until I saw a demo of this live, I couldn't believe where an adviser or end user is trying to chat to create an account opening or KYCAML kind of use case, and on the side you can see what the agents are doing, and that experience is fully personalized to that advisor. So each advisor office can do this differently. And they have a very personalized experience on how they open accounts, how they deal with clients, and how they lift that margin up for them. And that results in us having a significant boost in our margin targets. And so that's the first area in 2026 we are going to go after, which is starting with the operational transformation area and then learn from that and go after other business lines. And it's fascinating that as you're talking about operations that this is not just about cost, but this is also about personalization and improving the customer experience. So fascinating. Of possibilities almost feels like being a child in a toy shop. There is so much you can do, but there's also a reality check that I think it's fair to say, Nas, and I know that you're very aware of it, that there is a chasm between the promise and the reality. So what are some of the challenges that you and your teams are seeing in terms of implementing AI and cloud and realizing this vision? Yes, like there are a couple of stats I'll give you. One is The number of AI use cases truly in production according to McKinsey survey was about 6 to 7%, so we should be aware of that. The second stat is getting to a 60 to 70% accurate model and result is very fast, but from there trying to get to 80%, 90% is extremely hard. And so knowing that those things are hard, you solve for, to answer your question, the difficult problems first, which is something you know my team keeps reminding me. I always say solve for the difficult problems first, and that is creating a data ecosystem. Which is conducive to this, right? So at LPL we have been on this journey of transforming with your team's help and instead of team's self. We have been on this journey, you know, on transforming from a monolith to a data product environment where you can have a modern fabric and it's event driven where you can now, uh, connect data that we have on platform versus off platform data and now you can do those use cases faster. Um, so that is a hard yard fixing the data ecosystem, getting it ready, but that's in itself is not enough, in a financial services firm you have to think about security. You need to think about trust in the ecosystem because our business is all about trust. Our clients trust our advisers and that's how they are in business. So we have to be extremely prepared for trust and security. Now we all know that this whole. Technology landscape is very new, 2.5 years old, 3 years old, and so the maturity of that is not there yet. So you want to start in an area where you feel strong, comfortable with, and not like a most important segment of your business you put AI through. So I would say those two, and the third one which is obvious to all the people here is about talent, right? You have to do a talent transformation. It's not just uh. You know, like I would take an example of my own team. I see leaders who are actually embracing AI and they're doing it themselves, like, uh, and then there are leaders who are telling their teams to do it, but they are not themselves doing it. And you know, when I self-reflect, I was one of those 2 type of leaders, so I've just enrolled in a course myself so I can do it myself, but talent transformation is is and let's let's double click on a couple of these, you know, there are 3 or 4 important. Issues that you have raised, Natesh. Let's talk about data, because you also talked about, you know, choosing the right sequence, and data is very tricky because you know data can be like everything and very hard to kind of work through. And in your case you've had the added complexity or challenge that you have been kind of doing a spate of M&As, you know, at least one every year, and what I found very interesting is that you have used that that has been a challenge from a data perspective, but you have used that as an opportunity to actually upgrade your kind of data. Foundation. So talk us through that a bit, that how have you approached this whole data journey and especially with this, you know, the whole focus on inorganic growth. Yes, no, I think that has helped us a lot because many places when firms try to upgrade their data ecosystem, the challenge is your main business runs on legacy. And now you want to build something or transform to something new, but how do you, uh, you know, motivate or change that much of, uh, current ecosystem, that applications, advisor workstation, all of that to go to the new platform. So we use MNA as an opportunity. Think of it as a beachhead approach. So when we were integrating with our largest client to date, Prudential Financial, we introduced a new broker dealer concept, introducing broker dealer. And that didn't exist at LPL, so we got that as an opportunity to put that data flow, all the ecosystem around Prudential integration onto Data Foundation, which is the new AWS-based cloud-based modernized platform that we are building. And then as we did the next, next MNA, which is, um, you know, we acquired Atria Wealth, we put all the tamp flows which are new to LPL. What we used to do was very small tiny footprint. Whereas Atria uh got us an opportunity where it was all camps and so we took all that flow and put that on Data Foundation but we didn't so we continued that journey in 2026 where we have announced the acquisition of Commonwealth Financial and Commonwealth, we are going to do the big piece now where all of our custody data will be moving on to Data Foundation. So this is the real big milestone. So we've used those opportunities to transform our journey. Uh, it does come with the complexity of keeping the two systems, two sets of ecosystems in sync. Um, that's where your teams come in and help us from Insero. So thanks for your partnership there. Um, but it's complex. Uh, that's the hard yard you need to do before we could be ready for the AI journey. But we are very glad that we did all that work over the last 2 or 3 years, so we are ready for the next phase. You know, I want to go back to the point you made about sequence. I think that's a very important thing, that how do you skin the cat. So share some tips with us that how do you choose the right things to do, you know, what may seem like the biggest, may not be what you focus on. I know that that's something you think a lot about. So give us some tips around that. I think you know that's the if I have to give one tip, it is really the sequencing. It's not so much about can you come up with the best architecture, right, or what's the best architecture for agentic AI and you know what technology tool products we should buy that's not going to get you there. It's really doing things in the right sequence and the fundamental part or the most important thing for us from a sequencing perspective that we've learned is the journey to Data Foundation. And journey to cloud without those ingredients you you cannot even start and so since we have done or we are on our journey to get those two things done now comes the how do you democratize access to data and AI tools to a broader ecosystem. So right now while we are experiment experimenting with use cases, the thing that we are trying to solve for is how our business lines get engaged, how the product teams get engaged, how is it democratized for everyone. To start working with AI at at a pace, otherwise they, if all of them wait for technology and product to give them tools that then we will be behind the game. So that's the next one that which is learning journey for for the organization and building that momentum which is what we are up and the third thing which I said is the security and um and the trust. In the solution we build those three things in the sequence and then you can go after you know what is the best technology out there and whom should we partner with on the clock here. I'll come to my last question, which is about talent in the AI age, paradoxically, the human aspect becomes more important. So finally people. Talent, you know, what are your top three kind of, you know, mantras or you know what, what, what is the different that you're expecting from your teams? I know a lot of your teammates are sitting here, so very important for them. Yeah, I think, you know, anecdotally what I heard is we are the last generation who are managing only human beings. After this, our next generations will be managing human beings and AI agents. I don't know if it will be true, but that's the promised land. Um, I think it's a. It's not something magical is what I would say, but it's something you embrace, right? It's no longer like, OK, can I stay on the sidelines approach, so it's happening. And as I said, I'm taking it on myself to learn some of my team members are already experimenting and doing the coding themselves, and it's become so easy that you don't have to be a programmer anymore. So I think it's about everyone trying to do it themselves is the mantra, and you know the hiring will change in the future more towards ML engineering will become the main thing as opposed to software engineering or Python or what used to be you know, full stack engineer. So the twist will be more towards. Like all our hirings will shift towards ML engineering skill set. Amazing. I have a, you know, we are at time. Gotham is looking at me. So Nitesh Ambassador, thank you so much. Thank you for, you know, in 18 minutes we managed to cover the entire value chain of modernizing wealth management with cloud and AI. Uh, you know, I appreciate your insights and uh thank you to all the audience. Thank you also to AWS to bring us together here. Thank you. Thank you.
