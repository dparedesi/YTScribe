summary: "In this compelling lightning talk titled \"Accelerate Legacy Modernization with Slalom & AWS\" (MAM216), Alex Hatcher from Slalom Consulting introduces the \"Zero Legacy\" campaign, a strategic initiative designed to eliminate the technical debt that serves as a persistent barrier to innovation. Hatcher fundamentally redefines \"legacy\" not merely as aging technology, but as any system—typically monolithic, stateful, and centralized like ZOS or AS/400 mainframes—that significantly impedes an organization's ability to say \"yes\" to new creative ideas. He paints a vivid picture of the current existential crisis facing enterprises: spiraling maintenance costs and a critical skills gap, humorously yet poignantly illustrated by an anecdote of retired developers who are now training their own children to decipher comments in decades-old COBOL code so they can answer support calls from the beach. The session convincingly argues that Generative AI is the game-changer needed to break this cycle, transforming modernization from a labor-intensive archaeological dig into a streamlined, automated process. Hatcher details a sophisticated, AI-driven workflow starting with \"Reverse Engineering,\" where tools like Amazon Kendra and Amazon Bedrock knowledge bases are used to index zipped codebases in S3. This allows solution architects to leverage agents—accessed via Model Context Protocol (MCP) or Amazon Q Developer—to query, interpret, and document opaque system logic within hours rather than months. This deep understanding powers a \"Forward Engineering\" phase, where AI helps decompose monolithic functional paths into modern, stateless microservices specifications efficiently, utilizing spec-driven development tools. Crucially, Hatcher warns that technical prowess is useless without organizational alignment. Because mainframes often underpin core business processes developed over decades, successful modernization requires a \"human-centered\" strategy that unites often-siloed IT and product teams to manage the inevitable process disruptions. The talk culminates in a detailed case study of La-Z-Boy, the furniture giant, which had previously struggled to modernize its \"sticky\" Z Series mainframe workloads. Partnering with Slalom and utilizing an AWS-funded assessment, they mapped their complex ecosystem dependencies and executed a precise transformation plan. The technical execution was robust: using Amazon Q to accelerate infrastructure-as-code deployment, replacing Job Control Language (JCL) with AWS Step Functions for orchestration, transforming legacy COBOL programs into Python scripts running as Amazon ECS tasks, and migrating heavy DB2 datasets to Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL. Hatcher highlights a critical \"Mobilize\" and \"Migrate\" phase where they ran systems in parallel, verifying functional equivalence by comparing live data between DB2 and PostgreSQL. This rigorous testing not only ensured a safe transition but also exposed long-standing, invisible bugs in the legacy logic, empowering La-Z-Boy to finally rethink and optimize their business processes with a \"Zero Legacy\" mindset. This shift from simply keeping the lights on to actively improving business logic represents the ultimate value of modernization, freeing the organization to innovate without the \"drag\" of historical technical debt."

Hey everybody, I'm Alex Hatcher. Um, I'm with slalom, and, uh, I'm a part of our AWS cloud capability. Um, and today, let's see, it looks like we're a slide ahead. Today, we're gonna be talking about um our approach to accelerating legacy modernization. Um, so, Um, throughout the talk, what we're gonna, we're gonna cover, um, our Zero Legacy campaign, um, for our clients, uh, we're seeing that modernization is, uh, a, a strategic importance and it's important to us as well. Um, we, uh, so we'll, we'll cover that. We'll also discuss our, um, like what we're seeing in the, in the landscape and with our clients today. Um, we'll see some of the challenges that our clients are facing and some of the opportunities that come out of that. Um, you know, I, we're also really excited about a customer, like our, our most recent public customer story with Lazy Boy, where we were able to move them, uh, to Zero legacy by retiring their Z Series mainframe. So looking forward to telling you more about that. Zero legacy. So first off, what is legacy exactly? To us, um, we see legacy like a legacy system is anything that you have to change to, that you have to look at. Um, or that is a, a barrier to modernization. So like, or innovating in the way that you want to. So like I think we've probably all been in that situation or a lot of us have where um we're like, hey, like, you know, the, the product team wants to innovate, we wanna see something new, we wanna. Um, we see an opportunity for our business, um, but then when it comes to a technical discussion, we, we start to see, oh, but we've got to touch this, you know, system X, and if we do that, everybody kind of starts to pull back and we kind of see that idea or that creativity die on the vine right there. In that moment, to us, like that's really what our Zero Legacy campaign is about is solving that problem. We want to move you into a position where you're able to think creatively, uh, be imaginative, and not have the drag of legacy on your, uh, like in your space, so. So let's see. So, Of the, so a key qualifier that we see for, um, a lot of legacy systems, typically they're monolithic, um, typically they're stateful, uh, typically what we see in modern architectures is that they are microservice and non-monolithic and that they are, um, and that they're, they're stateless. So there's a need for us to kind of make, uh, like a paradigm shift between the two, overall and. Mainframe specifically is, you know, main like ZOS AS 400 workloads are very stateful, um, very monolithic and centralized. So, you know, that's, that's kind of like a key candidate for us like it is in a part of our, our strategic initiative in terms of what we wanna modernize, um, you know what we're hearing from our clients, uh, in this space is that the, um. Uh, what we're hearing from our clients in this space is that their costs are rising, um, and that it's difficult to hire. Um, I'll give you an example of one of our clients, uh, in the gov in the gov space is, um, so the original developers of their mainframe hired, they trained their children. To actually be able to maintain the system after they're retired, so it's a very real scenario for them where You know, Dad is like on the beach getting a phone call from his daughter who's saying, hey, I'm in the cobalt code. I see you in the comments. What were you thinking here? You know, like when we, when we modified this or when we created that. So that like to me that says our clients are being extremely creative about how they are trying to solve that skills problem of these legacy technologies. So we see that the problem is there, um, but, so why now, you know, and we see the pressure from, you know, like the cost and, and the, and the timing overall. But what's like, you know, what's kind of moving us forward and, and AI is a big component of that, probably no surprises for anybody. Um, what we're seeing in the AI space like these like these mainframes, uh, you know, or AS 400 legacy systems kind of have their, the, um. That being able to access the, the, the code, the data, um, monitoring real-time information is, uh, more of a black box than anything that we're gonna deal with like in a cloud environment where we're like heavily monitoring a microservice level. So generative AI has been extremely good at allowing us to reverse engineer those systems in a way that we never have before. Um, so what we used to do in those systems is we would have, uh, uh, numerous solution architects that would descend on a large code base, uh, describe that, then synthesize higher understandings of that code base, build diagrams, and then, um, you know, get feedback on that. Validate what they're finding and that's extremely labor intensive, um, it's extremely costly, but what we're, you know, and it, and what Gen AI has opened up for us is what we can do now is we could provision a Kendra index, we could provision bedrock, a bedrock knowledge base, and um we can essentially. Zip up our code, load it into that, into an S3 bucket, index it with uh, with Kindra, and then access our knowledge base through an MCP and like Q Developer or QCLI and we're able pretty much within an hour to start asking questions about our code to understand it, um, that can support a process where we can start documenting it and open that up with a very, very little overhead. So. I, I think just that in itself, the ability to use generative AI to assist in the re-engineering process is, is really driving us forward. So we're using generative AI in our modernization in a few different ways. We've already touched on, uh, the, the reverse engineering process and how we're able to really open up, um, uh, like, uh, these legacy systems and describe them and understand them in a way that we really never have been before. Um, we're also, we're still we're still seeing productivity gains from using generative AI just to augment like our traditional SDLC process. So now imagine I'm using. My preferred coding agent, which is definitely going to be Q or QCOI, and now what I'm able to do, not only am I able to just use the default model, which we've all seen is like a great productivity increase, but now we're again able to bring that context of that legacy code into that process where we can still use that to augment our traditional SDLC with tremendous productivity gains, like usually about 30% and sometimes more depending on the problem space. So Now let's look at our forward engineering process. So, if we're able to, like we, we see that we're able to describe these systems, we're able to extract that knowledge um from them. We're also now like we, we've seen really, really great advancements um with With uh spectrum and development toolkits like Kiro, um, Quiro CLI, that announcement that just came out, where there's opportunity now for us to lean into the future which could be spec driven development supported by like by the by the. What we're able to extract in a reverse engineering process. So like just to try to paint a bit of a picture of that, um, not only are we able like through like to use generative AI to kind of get those uh like a high level domain explanation of what the system does, but we're also able to decompose. Those domains and we're also able to look at and define and see the execution paths of the of the functions that we need to do or the subroutines that need to be executed to achieve a task from end to end and um you know if if you know if we're thinking about it, it's kind of like that's very similar to what we think of as a microservice, a single execution path of a single function. And so with context and with that fully documented as a part of our process, like we start to move into territory where it makes sense and it's completely possible to do more of a spec-driven development process that bring that's bringing all of that information into context with again full traceability of that specification back to the original code so we can validate as we go. So so far we've talked a lot about technology and technology is extremely important, um, but I think the one thing that we really do at slalom, uh, that we do really well is, um, that we look at, we connect with our clients and we meet them where they're at. So we've. I it's not just about like we could go, you know, like we, we've, I've seen what we've seen from our clients in some cases is they may say, hey, our mainframe or our AS 400 is a, that's an IT that's owned by IT and so we kind of own the trajectory of that service or maybe a product organization says, hey. I want to do something totally different than what we're doing, and they peel off and go in a completely different direction. We have not really seen that be successful. Um, what's necessary is that we get everybody aligned because we, at the end of the day, like that legacy system is at the core and it's been there more than likely for a few decades. Business processes have built up around that. Business processes have built up around those business processes. And we can't simply just rip that out without causing massive business disruption, and that's usually where we see a lot of that failure. So in our approach, we, we want to pull together all of our stakeholders, build alignment across our client organization, and then based on that, um, we're able to define a strategy that works for everybody, that's focused on the key outcomes that collectively we all want to meet. So So this is our Lazy Boy, uh, our story that we're, we're extremely excited about this, like, so, um, We, when we started with Lazy Boy and we talked to them originally in a half day workshop, um, they mentioned that they had a mainframe and we said, oh, let's talk more about that, and they were, they were resistant. It was kind of like, hey, we've tried to modernize this, we've tried to work with this a few different times, we've gone through a few different passes. We've got a team that's working on it and they're kind of slowly chipping away at it, but we said, you know, let's at least have the conversation and let's talk about what's possible. And as we went through, we kind of realized that um you know there's some real opportunity here for transformation and like um our bringing our AWS expertise along with the changes of generative AI which they had not incorporated into their process at that time. Um, opened up some doors and opened up the ability for us to do an AWS funded assessment to look at what they currently had. Um, we mapped the dependency. Like first we got the code, um, we, we used Amazon Que just to, to look at it and fully understand it. Um, we were able to map the dependency. to third party, like any sort of external systems that surrounded that core batch, the core batch workloads that they were working on and so we were able to kind of map out the full ecosystem and then from that we were able to identify key stakeholders for each one of those parts of the organization, engage them, get them involved, so we got everyone together and said, hey. Is this something that we want to do like we can show you a path. Like, do we want to make this real? And um you know, we, we did it like we moved forward and so we moved forward into a mobilized phase we used uh Q to accelerate our infrastructure deployment. We used uh uh Q as well to um. You know, to start building out step functions to replace the JCL for the jobs, um, we, we transformed the cobalt into Python and we deployed those as ECS tasks and we modernized their DB2 environment to a modern Aurora Postcrest environment. Um, so we scaled out, like, so during Mobilize, um, we, we used a subset of the workloads just to prove out that process and then we went to full migrate. Um, we modernized the full set of workloads. So at that point, we, we were production ready, um, but we still, we, we had built a testing process to ensure that we had functional equivalent before we went into a full go-live state with decommissioning. So at that point, Um, we basically set up this process that could compare DB2 and Postgress and uh and, and the data like as those jobs ran in synchronization and we saw some bugs that we fixed, but I think one of the things that that is the most interesting to me about this process is that. There were, we, we found bugs that they never knew existed that required us to rethink some business processes, and that was new for the organization. To, to, like that's the first time that we're like, hey, we're in this new world, we're in this cloud world where instead of stepping away from the table and saying this is just something we can't work with, it's like, hey, not only can we change this code. We can change this process here right now, um, you know, but what else can we change? What other process, uh, what other processes can we modernize? And, um, to us, that's the power of Zero Legacy. Um, I really appreciate you. Thank you so much for my talk. We're, um, I'm with Slalom again. We're at, uh, booth 625. Love to have you join me over there to continue the conversation. Thank you so much.
