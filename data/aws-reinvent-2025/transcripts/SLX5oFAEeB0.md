Group Corporation, John Kodera.
>> Good morning. Today, I'd like to talk to you about the
world that holds a very special place for Sony Kando the direct
translation of the word into English is emotion, but Kando
means more than that in Japanese. It captures feelings
of deep emotional connections and experiences when watching a
movie, listening to music, or playing a game. For us at Sony,
Kando is what we strive to create and deliver to our
customers in all aspects of our work. Kando is at the core of
who we are. Our founders created Sony in 1946 with the
dream to enrich people's lives through the power of technology,
a world where technology can deliver new experiences,
lifestyles and Kando. Driven by this vision, we have delivered
innovative products, creating entirely new industries and
customer experiences along the way. With each era of
technology, from analog to digital, the internet, The
Cloud, Sony has reinvented itself again and again. Today,
Sony is more than a hardware technology company. We are also
a leader in entertainment across games, music, pictures,
anime. There is no other company in the world like Sony.
With the depth of our business portfolio and touchpoint with fans and creators, one of the
most remarkable successes this year is the anime movie Demon
Slayer Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle. As of late
November, this film has become the highest ever grossing
Japanese film released worldwide and fifth highest
grossing film across all categories in 2025. As we've
done with Demon Slayer, we hope to keep delivering new Kando by
marrying the creator's vision with a deep understanding of
their fans, and our relationship with AWS plays a
pivotal role to make this happen. One example started in
the early 20 tens, when I was president of the Network
service company for PlayStation and other Sony devices. We
chose AWS as our provider for its global footprint, high
standards in availability and scalability. In 2020, for the
launch of PlayStation 5, we utilized AWS AWS building
blocks for our network utilized AWS AWS building
blocks for our network architecture. These services
allowed us to scale out at a moment's notice and accelerated
our shift to microservices, increasing deployment by 400%
with the one tenth the lead time. Today, our relationship
with AWS supports a safe, secure, and high quality gaming
experiences for up to 129 million gamers to connect and
experience Kando together. Moving forward, we see
incredible potential for growing the fan community,
connecting funds with similar tastes and interests across our
diverse portfolio of content IPS. At the same time, we also
want to better serve our creator community by providing
them with more tools, connection and insights to
their fan base. We call the Sony Engagement Platform,
creating deeper understanding and connection between the
funds through experience, content and the creators who
are making it. And one of the building blocks for the
engagement platform is the Sony Data Ocean. It utilizes data
insights generated from multiple connected data lakes
built using AWS services. It enables us to process up to
760TB of data from more than 500 data across Sony Group. Of
course, to make the most effective use of our data and
deliver Kando to our customers, we have to effectively harness
the power of AI and agents to empower our employees and
augment our business capabilities to maximize our
productivity in the enterprise setting, we are actively
promoting the usage of Generative AI, our homegrown
enterprise LLM, built using Amazon Bedrock over 57,000
users today. Since its introduction two years ago, and
we are serving 150,000 inference requests per day. And
today we are integrating new agent capabilities into our
platform to enable a new level of advanced operational
efficiency across our businesses by placing Amazon
Bedrock AgentCore at the center of our agentic AI system, we
gained the ability to easily govern, deploy and manage more
useful Agentic capabilities to accelerate our enterprise AI
transformation. And today, we are pleased to share that we
are adopting Nova Forge to apply state of the art,
customized models to our unique business and operations. We
fine tuned a Nova 2 Lite model that outperformed baseline
models for tasks like reference consistency and document
grounding. We are now aiming to increase the efficiency of
Sony's compliance review and assessment processes by 100 X,
in addition to the enterprise setting, Sony is fully
committed to the responsible and ethical development and use
of AI in the creative domain. We hold ourselves against the
highest standard and respect toward the rights of creators
and performers. So where are we going from here? We will
continue to create and deliver Kando fulfilling the
aspirations of both fans and creators, building meaningful
connection between them. In the future, we will continue to
expand our fans engagement with with their favorite content IP
across multiple entertainment genres, as we have done with
Uncharted and The Last of Us. We hope to connect funds and
creators in both virtual and physical environments,
including location based entertainment. Realizing our
vision, we require even greater and stronger collaboration with
AWS as well as our creative and technology partners in the
audience. We look forward to creating and delivering even
greater Kando to our fans across the world. Thanks.
Thanks for listening. Thank you.
