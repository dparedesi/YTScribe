>> Thank you, Ruba and good afternoon, everyone. I'm here
to tell you a story of how 115 year old publishing icon
transformed into a modern digital media powerhouse. As
you saw, Condé Nast owns some of the world's most influential
brands, powered by extraordinary journalism, and
we reach over a billion people globally. When I joined Condé
Nast in January of 2020, we had some digital presence, but our
business was still mostly print. As hard as it is to believe, we
didn't have any HR system and we didn't have a finance system,
and we were facing existential threats from social media
platforms and 15 second long video clips. We operated across
12 markets, 22 plus global brands and nine languages. We
still do. Each market had its own mix of brands,
infrastructure, platforms and product platforms. Our number
one priority at the time was global consolidation. Getting
it to a single content platform on AWS, one single API stack
and one global front end framework powering all of our
brands globally in every market. This gave us a solid foundation
that was global, multi-region and resilient. Our editorial
teams could finally collaborate with each other, and our
content could easily be syndicated across markets and
languages using AI based translation. Our product teams
were able to create reusable capabilities and launch them
globally. But as with every transformation, new challenges
emerged. Our legacy workflows were just weren't built for
real time publishing. We lacked a cohesive data strategy or an
ability to to experiment and a unified view of our customers.
Our four digital business lines often conflicted with each
other, and simple decisions like a paywall became an
emotional argument rather than a data driven decision. Our
data estate back in 2020 was extremely fragmented. We had
multiple data warehouses, no taxonomy, no governance, no
consistent way of extracting insights. So we created a
deliberate AI ready data strategy. Snowplow became our
real time data pipeline for high quality behavioral data.
And Databricks became our central lakehouse due to its
seamless integration with AWS storage, compute, and
activation stack. As we stand today, we have instrumented
every user touchpoint globally, with snowplow unifying all user
behavior data into a single Databricks Lakehouse. This has
created a foundation for accurate modeling, ML feature
generation, and trusted reporting. This stack unlocked
cross-cutting capabilities allowed us to integrate our
customer data platform with Databricks, enabled us to do
sophisticated multivariate testing, and gave us a true 360
degree customer view and an identity spine. In order to
implement your AI strategy. Trust in your data is the most
essential thing. We invested heavily in governance,
semantics, business definitions. Taxonomy, data lineage, and
data quality using Databricks Taxonomy, data lineage, and
data quality using Databricks Unity Catalog. This allowed us
to scale our AI with confidence. This strategy has enabled us to
meet the challenges I mentioned earlier. Real time analytics
for events and live streams became a major part of our
digital shift. Starting from nothing, we built a live
streaming platform in AWS, and we streamed the first live
event, which was the Met Gala of May 2021, right after the
pandemic. Since then, we have streamed hundreds of events on
this platform and you can, as you can see from the Met Gala
we had recently in May 2025, the numbers are absolutely
staggering. We had 54% more engagement than the Grammy
Awards. We had nearly 400% more engagement than the Golden
Globes. And here's the kicker a whopping 522% more engagement
than the Super Bowl. Subscriptions are our second
largest digital revenue stream, and New Yorker is our biggest
subscription brand. Our data strategy enables personalized
subscription flows and sophisticated testing to reduce
friction and increase subscription conversion. This
year, The New Yorker celebrated 100 years, and it also
surpassed a million paid subscribers. There are three
key lessons that we learned on this journey. First, reframe
your legacy as a competitive advantage. Modernize
capabilities while honoring your brand strengths. Second,
take a sequential approach. Organize your data first before
trying to extract insight. Bring AI to your data rather
than trying to take your data to AI. And most importantly,
align every team around one trusted data strategy. Finally,
choose the right partners based on openness, security, and
interoperability. The right partners reduce transformation
time by years. Our business outcomes have also been
extremely remarkable. Despite headwinds affecting publishers,
we have grown our audiences, we have increased loyalty, and we
have dramatically increased time spent on our on our
digital properties, all driven by personalization and a better
user experiences, complemented by our world class journalism.
We have not only created value for our business, we have also
reduced operational costs by over $10 million by
consolidating on AWS and Databricks, we now have 66
digital properties representing 22 plus brands globally unified
on AWS, powered by a powerful data strategy. We have shifted
from being a print centric to a modern digital business.
Decisions are now data driven and not opinion driven, and
workflows that we once thought were impossible are now a
reality. We have flipped our revenue to 70% digital and 30%
print. And now one more thing. We now actually have a global
financial system and a global We now actually have a global
financial system and a global HR system. Based on running
years of running AI and ML models on Databricks and AWS,
we have built an AI powered contracts management and rights
clearance system using AWS Bedrock, SageMaker and
Marketplace tools. This has reduced our rights clearance
workflow from weeks down to minutes. We recently also
deployed an AI powered content moderation system for user
generated content, and that leverages Amazon Nova 2 Pro.
And we are now in the process of vectorizing all of our
content in Databricks, which will allow us to hyper
personalize our user experiences and also make our
content ready for discovery by LLMs in real time. And we are
just getting started. We are looking forward to building
more on AWS AgentCore and Databricks Lake based and
Databricks Agent bricks. Print is what defined us digital
expanded US, and now AI and data has transformed us and
continues to transform us. Thank you.
