>> Hi everyone! It's so great
to be here with you all in The Cloud! When I was growing up in
Argentina, I deconstruct sites on our family computer and
bring my own ideas to life by typing a file to a server and
sharing a link with my friends. It was the best feeling I could
just build and I never stopped building. I built with every
tool and every framework, which eventually led me to create my
own framework as one does Next.js. With Next.js, we made
building high quality applications accessible to
anyone from the biggest enterprises on the planet to
solo developers starting out with just an idea. The problem
was that even with Next.js, I built an app in a couple hours
and then spent weeks setting up infrastructure to get it out
into the world, and I didn't just want easy, I wanted peak
performance at scale and I wanted it now. That idea led me
to build Vercel. Ten years later, Vercel now empowers more
than 11 million customers to build, scale and secure global
web applications without managing infrastructure. With
more than 1 trillion requests served every month, now AI is
changing. What and how we build interfaces are becoming
conversations and workflows are becoming autonomous. We're
witnessing the shift from web pages to AI agents. This is
perhaps the most important transformation we'll see in our
careers as developers and technologists. And this is how
the Vercel AI Cloud was born to redefine fully managed
infrastructure for the AI era. We call this self-driving
infrastructure. You write an app, you push your code, and
automatically the best possible infrastructure is provisioned,
orchestrated and optimized for you. Vercel operates as an
always on system that observes every input from the code you
write, the code you ship to the traffic your users generate,
and turns that data into real time insights and optimizations.
You get to focus on your business, your products, your
customers. And we know this works because we prove it at
scale every day with our customers, but also because we
build Vercel. Guess what? With Vercel on Vercel and Vercel is
powered by AWS, which means with just one git push, you
reap the benefits of fully self-driving AWS infrastructure.
So let's look at this in action first v0. V0 is the realization
of that original dream. The thing I wished existed when I
was hacking together my websites. In Argentina. You
speak your mind and in seconds you have a live working
application. Since its launch, v0 has been serving millions of
requests per day. And that was possible because under the hood
v0 runs on Vercel, which runs on AWS with model inference
provided by Amazon Bedrock. When we were building v0, our
engineers could just write code, deploy it over cell, and scale
without configuring AWS primitives. And so this freed
up the team's time, the v0 team's time to focus on the
novel AI challenges with new models and new ideas and new
techniques coming up every week. So to keep up and move at the
speed of AI, we built the AI SDK. So think of it as Next.js
with Next.js did for building pages. AI SDK does for building
agents. So first, of course we build it for ourselves, and
then we made it available for everyone. It makes AI simple,
model agnostic and scalable. Today, AI SDK is downloaded
about 5 million times per week, and with AI SDK, anyone can
build with AI. Whether it's your first AI app or your at
scale like Thomson Reuters, there are co-counsel AI
assistant serves attorneys, accountants, audit teams. They
used AI, SDK and Vercel, and a team of just three developers
built their tax advisory agent in just two months, and it's
already in use by 1300 accounting firms. Now they're
migrating their entire code base to AI SDK, deprecating
thousands of lines of code across ten providers and
consolidating everything into one composable and scalable
system. Three developers, two months, thousands of firms
could be any of you. And so as we move from pages to agents
and pixels to tokens, it's helpful to reuse lessons from
the past. The web scaled thanks to CDNs, which increased speed
and reliability. And that's why we built the AI Gateway. Think
of it as a CDN of tokens. It routes inference automatically.
It adds failover in critical controls. AI Gateway is built
on the same global network that solves all of our customers
across 20 regions, close to your users and your AWS data.
This network runs on battle tested AWS infrastructure,
Global Xcelerator shield, S3, EC2, and more. But here's the
next challenge AI is changing the profile of our workloads.
While traditional apps need to load in milliseconds, agents
can think over minutes or even hours and soon days. So
serverless has been great for scaling on demand, right? So
which we also need for agents. But it hasn't been so great for
what we call idle time. That's what we built. Fluid Compute.
It's compute optimized for AI powered by AWS fluid adapts to
every workload, whether it's pages or agents. Your functions
scale on demand, but crucially, you pay only for what you
actually use. Active CPU time. This is fully self-driving
compute infrastructure. Our AI Cloud goes beyond Vercel's own
services, providing seamless access to even more AWS
solutions like AgentCore, Kiro, and RDS. How we build the web
is changing. You'll be working with agents like v0 and Kiro.
These agents will be writing code using frameworks like
Next.js and AI SDK, and they'll deploy to self-driving
infrastructure. This is the future of the web, powered by
Vercel backed by AWS. Thank you.
