Good afternoon, or good evening I should say. Thank you for coming to IND 322, redefining operations with Caterpillar's Geospatial Intelligence Solutions. I'm Steve Blackwell and I lead our product engineering and services um team at AWS which covers the solution areas of product engineering and smart products and services for automotive and manufacturing. Um, and today it's a pleasure, having started my career as an engineer at Caterpillar, to be co-presenting with Ash, Alan, and Shri Ram, um, who are gonna come up on stage later on talking about, um, their geospatial intelligent solution. So what do we have for today? So I'm gonna start off, and I just want to give a a brief kind of background and overview of how we talk about smart products and services at AWS and how we help manufacturers kind of build their smart products and services, you know, solutions on AWS for their connected products and kind of the capabilities around that. At that point, I'm then gonna hand over to the Caterpillar team, um, who are gonna go through a little bit of an overview of, you know, Caterpillar Inc. themselves. And then go into a little bit of a deep dive around the Cat Helios, um, Caterpillar's digital data platform. Um, talk about their construction, customers, you know, problems and how they take advantage of the, um, capabilities that Cat Digital have been developing. Then we're gonna go in to talk about um C grade, and then finally we'll finish off talking about, you know, Vision Link, OK? So with that, let's start and kind of talk about smart products and services. So when we work with, you know, manufacturers, um, smart products and services cover, you know, a broad kind of area. And we break this down into three pillars, consumer, commercial, and industrial. You know, consumer is anything from a, a robot vacuum cleaner in your home to a smart plug. Commercial, you know, anything from a printer in an office, through to a HVAC system in an office building. And then finally, industrial, everything from a Caterpillar mining truck right through to a robot on the shop floor. But across these three areas you really see kind of a common pattern of what manufacturers are wanting to do with their products. The first one is be able to have it connected. And once that connectivity is there, it then allows the manufacturer to then start, you know, providing additional capabilities on top of that. The first one's around kind of, when you see this as a journey, around data and analytics. So once that product's connected, they can actually understand, you know, how that product is actually operating and being used kind of out in the field. From there we see, you know, manufacturers then go, now they understand how that product's being used, they've got a little bit of kind of data analytics around use cases like condition-based monitoring. They can then start applying, you know, AI and ML on top of that dataset to start providing kind of insights, you know, a prime example around a product is around predictive maintenance, for example, or condition-based monitoring. But it's not just around kind of, you know, the data. We also see manufacturers looking to say now that our product is actually connected, it allows them to really focus on the customer experience. cos it allows them to understand how their customers are using their product and they can actually start linking, you know, the telemetry data, the event data. Usage data of that product to their you know their customers' insights, either through their service management portal or through their sales team or their field service teams that are actually out with the customer. So they can actually start developing features and capabilities and start improving customers' experience of using their products. We're also seeing that, you know, products are evolving as well, and they're now starting to become a lot more software defined. OK, so it's not just around, you know, the hardware and the the IoT or connectivity platform around that, but really, you know, how they can actually start to provide more features and capabilities as software on those actual products themselves. So it's really enabling manufacturers to be able to add new capabilities to those products once they're actually out in the field, you know, based on, you know. Customer feedback or being able to kind of uplift and up-level that product of how it's actually being used, um, as part of new service packs for example. And then finally, we're seeing um manufacturers see, OK, now I've got my connected, my product connected, now I'm offering all these different kind of capabilities around predictive maintenance or, you know, customer 360. You know, can I actually change my business model? Can I go from, you know, selling a product and offering kind of services, maintenance support packages to a product as a service, and generating new kind of revenue streams or creating new business models. So that's kind of like the capability, but we very much see this as kind of a, a journey that manufacturers go through. You know, a lot of manufacturers talk about product as a service, but they've really got to start kind of at the level one that we describe. Kind of that connectivity, understanding those KPIs, being able to do. Provisioning device management device life cycle in some cases in consumer or commercial, a product may go through multiple different owners or be in multiple different sites or buildings, for example. So therefore that whole life cycle management has got to be built into it. We talked about kind of analytics and AI and services, but this is really where we also see manufacturers kind of expand beyond kind of their IOT platform or their connected platform, and start to integrate it into the aftermarket parts and servicing. OK, so for example, if you know, there's a lot of spare parts, management, um, as part of the actual product, how can you use the product's telemetry data to feed into kind of the service team's um management of, you know, spare parts. So, unfortunately, when there is a service event, either a proactive or reactive, and that maintenance engineer goes out to site, they actually have the parts available in their van, in their truck, to be able to do the work on that. And then finally, you know, as I said, you know, product as a service, and this is really where, you know, these new business models are coming in. You know, manufacturers have been able to offer kind of, you know, SLAs around it, you know, potentially, you know, offer capabilities like zero downtime, you know, outcome driven kind of engagements. And as you see, as they go through that journey of 12, and 3, we see increased value, you know, being added, you know, to the customer of using those products. And this is all really kind of enabled by what we describe as telemetry driven X. You know, and that X could be, you know, parts management, service management, you know, as an example. But really taking the telemetry from the product and actually being able to use it across the extended value chain of, you know, a manufacturer's, um, business. OK, so what does this look like from a conceptual architecture point of view, from a smart products point of view? Obviously, Caterpillar guys are gonna come up here and talk specifically around their architecture and go into details around how they've actually architected it. Um, but this is really kind of our conceptual architecture of how we see, you know, manufacturers build out their, um, smart products and services platform. So on the left-hand side, obviously we have the, the connected product, and that's gonna need a secure, you know, data ingestion of the data from the product into the AWS Cloud. In most cases, this is done via, you know, IOT, you know, streaming kind of the telemetry of the events. In some cases, depending on where the product is. If it's like out in a, a potential remote location where connectivity may be. Um, not as reliable as you would have in kind of a, a city. There may be bulk uploads of that data, and that may happen directly via into an S3 bucket or maybe using kind of API's, um, based on the, you know, the product's determining what its condition is. Then within the actual AWS Cloud, obviously that data's gonna come into, you know, a data lake. And on top of that data lake, which is generally built on kind of, you know, Amazon S3, we start to build kind of those microservices type capabilities. You know, fleet management is like one key capability we see manufacturers build as part of smart products. Having remote control and remote management is a, a key one. Um, obviously telemetry and event management is generally where most manufacturers start. It's kind of their main use case to actually drive and build out this platform. And then on top of that, they've got analytics and AI insights. And then finally, you know, agents kind of come into this, especially when you start to talk about kind of maintenance and so forth, identifying kind of an event or anomaly from the product, you're going to bring that into the telemetry management part. Obviously the analytics and AI insights is going to determine is that potentially a part. Failure or a service event and obviously those agents are really going to come in to orchestrate creating the service management ticket for potentially an engineer or a customer support center to actually contact the customer to tell them that actually we would like to come out, we'd like to service your appliance or your vehicle or your truck or whatever that product may be. And then on the right hand side, there's gonna be multiple personas that are gonna be interacting with this product, um, platform. Obviously there's a mobile application which the service engineers or the end users are gonna be using. There's probably gonna be some business intelligence, um, kind of capability built on top of it, to be able to understand, you know, how the products are performing, you know, typical usage of those products from a features, capabilities point of view. And there's obviously going to be enterprise, you know, application integration, the CRM system, the MRO system, for example. OK, so I just wanna touch on one thing, you know, obviously, you know, I talked about, you know, agents as part of that platform, but really kind of, we're really starting to see manufacturers look at OK, now I've got my products connected, you know, how can I actually bring AI in to kind of enhance that product, you know, and increase the customer's kind of experience of that. And we see kind of a couple of areas where we're really starting to see kind of AI really help in, you know, products. First one is around kind of the product development. You know, using AI in a machine-based, you know, simulation. You know, helping those physics-based simulations or designing the product, either the hardware, in finite element analysis, or CFD or in the software development, been helping the developers test, validate and integrate their actual software. Obviously we see assistance kind of coming into products and really helping kind of differentiate and you know, innovate on that actual product and how it's being used, and starting to provide more of a, a personalized experience, you know, dynamic UI UI's based on how potentially that person is using that actual product itself. Anyway, that's kind of a, a brief overview of kind of like how we see smart products and services, the types of use cases and how potentially, you know, AI is gonna be start to be used more and more in smart products and services. And with that, I'll hand over to Ash. Thanks, Steve. Good evening. Uh, my name is Ash Shaw. I have, uh, responsibilities for sort of technology strategy and, uh, engineering, emerging technology, engineering technology in our space. Uh, primarily my team is responsible for sort of determining the what we need to deliver to meet customer, customer needs. Uh, so before we get into the geospatial solution, uh, that you're all here to hear about, I wanna give a little bit of a background, uh, about Caterpillar if I can get this slide to work. Thank you. So Most of you have probably seen cat equipment as you've been driving on the highway or have gone past job sites. Uh, what you may not realize is that Caterpillar has a global footprint. We are a multinational company. We are a global leader in the equipment, equipment that is being built that is necessary for building the infrastructure that sort of powers our world. Uh, our workforce, uh, over 112,000 strong. Uh, exists over in 24 different countries in 140 different locations. Uh, Combine that with our extensive dealer network of 152 dealers operating in 190 countries that allows us to bring together a broad range of expertise in construction, mining, engines, turbines, and, and locomotives. We also have millions of machines operating around the world on almost every continent. Uh, of those machines, 1.5 million of those are connected, uh, so from excavators to generators, they are all streaming data to our back office, and we then process that, so. How does Caterpillar, a company with this kind of breath. Harness that data analyzes it, process it well that is sort of the beginning of our Cat Helios data platform journey and for that I'm gonna hand it over to Alan, uh, to go into more details on that. Thanks Ash. Ali works again. All right, I'm Alan Dodes. As they introduced me earlier, I'm the director of architecture for Cat Digital. Uh, digital is obviously a big buzzword. What we mean at Digital at Caterpillar is our customer and dealer solutions that enable them to be very successful, um. We're gonna talk about why, uh, we built Helios and we'll talk a little bit about what we, we built, uh, how we built it, and then also because I talk about the scale and I'm gonna hand it off back to these guys to talk about one of the solutions built on top of it. Why we build it probably about in 2018 or so we had um just a a potpourri of technologies that were deployed across all our digital solutions. We had Teradata, we had Cognos, we had Hadoop, we had Azure. We had everything everywhere, everywhere all at once. And, um, we heard back from our customers and dealers. They were confused because all these different solutions gave a different answer to what my fleet was. What's my customer data? We didn't really have very good control of it. And we had another failed experiment with outside um company uh that we usually try to go to to solve some of our problems. So our EO got involved and said, OK, we're gonna bring in somebody that's gonna help solve this for us and actually bring in digital talent. And so I brought brought in our SVP Augie. Uh, Resnick, and he brought in a huge ton of talent. We set off to build this Helios platform, right? We wanna be confident in the data. We wanted all of our digital solutions to use it. We wanted to be secure. We wanted to get all the market faster on those solutions, and we also want to improve our customer experience most overall so that way we can make things easier. So a little bit of how we built this, right? So kind of from a logical architecture perspective we're looking at on the left hand side with point A there we got all the data we need to bring in from, uh, the different sources, uh, enterprise sources like what we built, what we manufactured, those things are kind of easy, but once you got to our dealer and customer that very that became very complex because we had a. 160 different dealers are their own businesses. They use their own systems, so bringing in their service information of what they actually did to equipment was very complex and trying to get through that. And then, as Ash said, we got 1.5 million connected assets out there. So we had to bring all those assets in. And some of those assets and devices are probably made when I was when I graduated college. It was a long time ago, um, so we brought those in and then. What we had to do was then bring in all that data and bring a single point of truth, right? What is an asset, right? What is a customer? What is a dealer? And since all those different pieces of information came from different sources, we had to bring those in. Then we had to bring in services, so we didn't want to just bring in a data platform and make a data lake. We actually want to build APIs and services on top of those so that way applications can use them and not replicate the data. Next we wanna make sure that we had data analytics. We knew the power of the data wasn't just doing making the data available but actually putting insights on top of it and we built a large data analytics pipelines execution and training environment that we can actually run and build on scale that was always our problem before all the vendors couldn't scale to our problem size. No, we want to make sure it's a secure to design, and of course we want to get a faster market, and then we want to be able to make sure we control our costs. So what did we provide from a functional perspective like we talked about from a data perspective? Data was the first thing we had to get controls of. We had to get control of the single troph of customer, dealer, service, parts, all those different types. We have over 325 data objects that we've created that we've mastered. And those services are then the drive data on top of those, so we made sure that those drive services, um, that we could then build those APIs, events, um, notifications, those sort of things we built over 340 of those so that way I had one single source, uh, API that would give me what my fleet list is across all my commerce apps, my customer equipment apps, and all those. Then analytics, we deployed over 23,000 models, um, high frequency inference models, on-demand real, real time. And some obviously you gotta have your ML ops training as well. And then onboarding, we heard it from our customers. Our deal is the most onboarding a customer is very hard. It's not like the auto manufacturing auto industry where we've got a VIN number and you have to go to the state and get your license, right? We, we don't know that. Someone could just say that I own this tractor, so we have to do that a lot more. It's very hard for us to do. So that's, we have to do a lot of investment to get in there, but we've got 1.7 million customers on the platform. So by the numbers we're talking about scale, right? So obviously we wanna make sure we're highly available and that's one of the reasons why we chose AWS um over some of the other uh cloud providers that we had. And then we have 296 million pipelines, you know, running per month, 1.4 million API calls, and 50 billion data records per month as well. And just an example, this is all built on ABOS for the most part, right? And just from an example perspective, 680 S3 buckets, 21K million there, 5.7 ECS, Dynamo, and, and gateways. And of course there's tons of other services I didn't list on those. Those are just the main scale. And just to show you that it wasn't just a single database that we've spun up, right? It's a very complex environment that you had to move because. You our previous people that tried to solve this before, they're like, oh, we'll just spin up one elastic cache cluster and one, elastic search and we'll be good to go. And we're like, no, no, that's, that's not gonna work for the domain and size of data that we have. So we have 1 1.15 petabytes of storage, 265 mailing lines code, and 3000 pipelines, and one of the happiest things we have is 125 applications on board. So that's both from a, uh, a data BI perspective as well as a digital solutions perspective that are, uh, web applications, things like that. And that's why I'll turn it over back to Ash and Shriram to cover one of the solutions that they built on top of the platform. Thanks. Thank you. All right. So we have Helios as our foundation. Now we want to start thinking about. How do we help our customers solve some of their toughest challenges? I'm not going to read everything on this slide for you, but, uh, our customers have a ton of inefficiencies both in the construction and in the mining space. As you can see from the data on the slide, there is a ton of opportunity where we can remove inefficiencies, remove waste. We want to use the Helios platform to get the data, get the analytics to say how do we take what we have and help our customers solve some of these problems. So before we get into the sort of the geospatial solution, let's just talk a little bit about this, right? Uh, construction customers are wasting 10% of their materials, you know, a third of work is redone, uh, and then eventually what that all leads to is that only nearly three quarters of projects are late. Anyone of you that's I maybe built a house or gone through that have probably felt that pain you've seen the inefficiencies that exist in the construction space. Now think about that on a much broader scale, some of our big infrastructure projects, how many of you have given down the highway and you've just seen barrels forever and you're like, how long does it take to update a road? It feels like it's way longer than it should be, right? Some of this is a result of these inefficiencies where there's just inefficiencies in the process. So what we wanted to do is build a solution that can try and at least attack some of these issues. One of our solutions is cat grade. Cat grade. Is Caterpillar's integrated machine control system available in a host of different machines such as dozers, excavators, motor graders, and pavers. Think of it like a smart assistant uh for heavy equipment. Uh, it helps the operator do cut, fill, and sort of pass with with precision. So it's you guys who have modern cars have like lane assist or auto braking, you know, it helps the operator use the equipment better. This is sort of the same thing with cat grade. At Grade uses GPS sensors and onboard computers to continuously track the position of the blade or the bucket. It provides near real-time location of the digital design loaded into the system so you know how you're operating based on what you need to do. So you know if you need to slope it by 3%, uh, the machine can measure the ground terrain and be able to tell you whether you're above or below and then adjust the blade as it needs to. So in the cab, the operator gets this sort of feedback. It allows them to make adjustments and in fact it'll do some of that for them. And then every time the machine goes over a piece of terrain, that data is collected and then sent to the back office where it can be processed. Now, I explained that a lot, this video will sort of give you a quick 2 minute overview of cat grade in action, hopefully this will make it a little bit clearer. We're here at Carolina Cat's demo facility, and today we're gonna talk about the D5 with CAT 3D grade and vigilant productivity. We're gonna show you the features of these technology systems and how they can help you do your work faster and more efficiently. We have a full 3D plan of this site and we're using the machine to get the site to finish grade in the least amount of time possible. Typically we'd take a USB and load that 3D design on the display, but with Vision Link productivity, we can actually remotely load the design in the cloud and then download it to our machine. We can help reduce the number of trips to the job site by remotely managing designs as the plan changes and ensure the operators on the latest and greatest plan. With Visual Link productivity, we can remotely access the machine 3D system to help the operator with the most efficient settings on board the machine and ensure that it's on the correct current design. With CAT 3D grade and Visual Link productivity, the site manager is able to manage multiple sites in a much more proficient manner. Now that Aaron has the file loaded, he's actually watching the display and the light bars. That's giving him cuts and fills and also horizontal alignment no matter where he goes on this project. We added another feature called 3D steer assist. Aaron will select the line and then the machine will actually move left or right so that blade tip stays on the focus line and gives him not only elevation but steering guidance to that line. The benefits of CAT 3D grade, it allows them to use automatics once they get close to grade to be more efficient, more productive. With CAT Factory 3D grade with Visual Link productivity, it will allow you to maximize the return on your machine investment and get your projects done quicker in order to make more money. All right, hopefully that made, oop, hopefully that made a little bit more sense about what C grade is, so a lot of that focus was the in-mine what we call on board systems, right, helping the operator actually use the equipment. As we, as was alluded to, and you may have seen that in the video, right, there was talking about Visual Link productivity, uh, it's now under the Visual Link umbrella, but what Visual Link will do is it's the back office web component that combines with the onboard data that we're collecting to really make the solution viable for our customers and allows the back office to help the operator and make sure that they're working on. The right information. One of the problems that we have that we've seen with customers is that they work on old designs. Someone made an update. That update didn't get to the correct operator. He or she is now working and doing the wrong thing. This system with Visual Link in the background allows us to ensure that all the machines. Have the latest designs and are able to do it. What C grade gives us is the ability to correctly measure our metrics, our volumes, make sure that the right amount of dirt has been moved. We can make sure that our surfaces are properly constructed, speeding up the job process, cutting down on waste, and cutting down on cost. Having the machines at the optimal blade settings and using just doing the right amount of work improves our machine performance and so that the, the ground is optimized for and the machine is doing the best job that it it can and then because of all of that, because there is less waste, there is less damage to the environment, you know, we have an environmental impact where the construction work has the minimal footprint than it can for sustainability. Now what we need, what our, what we're now getting to the heart of our geospatial solution is we have all of this data that's coming off the machine that now needs to be processed by our back office, the solution that we built on top of Helios, and that is our geospatial solution, and I'll hand it over to Shiram, who is our solution architect, to provide the technical details. Thank you, Ash. Caterpillar is a stronger company. The stronger our digital solutions get. This was Augie, our chief digital officer. In a podcast. I'm Shira Solution architect with Caterpillar for the last 10 years. We look at how Caterpillar, being a huge manufacturing company. have been building Good Digital solutions for our customers to use. Let me ask you this. What is the single important factor? That is needed for a business to succeed. Cost efficiency. Right? Anything else? Mhm. Those are right answers, right? So, but it's not the revenue. It's not the market share. Yes, but it's not quality as well. Not even innovation, right, but it's the customer satisfaction, right? That's the most important thing. Add Caterpillar Customer is at the heart of everything that we build. So we look at how Vision Link that is powered by Helios. It's helping our customers succeed every day. Let's do something interesting. Can I ask all of you to close your eyes for a moment? Think of you being in a busy airport. Flights taking off, landing, moving in every direction. There is something that is controlling everything and keeping everything safe and coordinated, right? What is that one thing? Any guesses? Please. I think someone said that Yeah, airport control tower, right? That's the one thing that is actually keeping everything safe and coordinated in an airport. Similarly, in a job site, be it a construction site or a mining site. It's vision link that is keeping everything safe and coordinated, making sure all our missions are actually working smooth and sane. Vision Link is Caterpillar's cloud-based solution. That provides Real time Visibility to what is happening in a job site. You can track fuel levels, utilization of every mission. You can schedule maintenance from the application. So on and so forth. You can actually track where my asset is, what is it actually doing right now. All those things are possible with Vision Link. With Vision Link, it's all about making the most out of the data that you are getting back. To the back office. We look at, we understood what is vision link, right? So we look at. Top 3 use cases that our customers are using in conjunction with the in-cap solution that Ash was talking. That we have in our digital solutions that are helping our customers. We are sitting in this. Beautiful auditorium, right? The The surface that we are sitting on is flat, but if you look at a job site, a mining or a construction site, you are going to have elevation changes in them. So what we are doing is our in-cab solutions actually pick up the elevation as the machine is moving on the job site, and that data is transferred to the back office and we can have an elevation profile that can be shown in the application so that customers can understand what is the elevation profile of the job site that the mission is working on. That's one thing. Our missions actually move the dirt. They move the dirt from crest to trough and then move the dirt from troughs to crests as well. We call it a cut and fill, and the back of a solution can calculate the cut and fill volumes. These two are critical parameters in our application. Where you are able to understand the lay of the land, you know how the surface is in a job site, and you are able to calculate the amount of dirt that is getting moved over by our machines. This is the interesting stuff. So as you can see, our missions are Sending the data to Helios, which is actually an upstream system for our Service That is Completely facading everything that is happening left of us, so it is just an upstream system. It is a black box to us, and we are getting the data from Helios piped into us. And once we get it, we are actually using a step function to parse the data. We have proprietary data formats that are coming in from the field, and we are parsing the data using step functions because we have multiple steps of parsing that needs to happen. Once we do that, we store it in Pores with a post GS extension. We use that for storing our surface data. Apart from storing the data we use. SNS SQS fan out pattern as well to do parallel processing apart from storing the data, so we use it for calculating the volumes. We also do elevation tiles that we are calculating and then pushing it to AS3 while we do that and it is being obviously served from cloud front to the end user. We are actually invalidating the tiles as we get the surface of the data from the machines. For example, right, so you have a 1 ft by 1 ft data that is coming into the back office and while we calculate if the elevation has changed, we would need to invalidate the tile and make sure that we are showing the right tile at the right location. So the bottom portion is pretty straightforward. You have the user talking from the through the APA through ELB and the Fargate task. Apart from it, it is brow from the browser, he's able to actually download the uh tiles from the cloud front. Pretty straightforward stuff. Now that we know the lay of the land, we knew that the surface has elevation changes and you are able to see the elevation profile. The to be state surface. So for example, typically you will have a surface that is having crescent troughs, and then there will be a surveyor who will be surveying and then finding out how the to be state surface needs to be. Let's say for example you are constructing an airport. You will need a flat surface at a specific elevation. That data is actually created by the surveyor, and then it is created as a design file. And that will be sent to the back office, from the back office to the machine. Before that happens through Helios again from the application, so you can upload the design file and then you will be able to send the file to the machine or machines that are actually working in the job site. Before we send this into the Job site we are able to see the preview of the file. So what happens is that let's say this, as you would have probably guessed. I can be a site manager working in Vegas. I'm probably working remotely, and then there is an operator who is actually operating the machine in, let's say Peoria. While he does that, the file transfer happens remotely. And what we have seen is that these files, as I was saying, the surveyors use design tools to actually create them. And we do not have a way for anyone to have those softwares to visualize them. What we have brought in is a visualization capability where you can look at a design file in 3D format before it is actually sent to the machines. So this is a really critical feature, for example, so. We had Probably 12 months this feature has been in the production and prior to that we had a lot of customer feedback where operators were actually getting wrong design files because the ecosystem is broken and we had to actually fill in and then make sure we are sending allowing the users to send the right design file to the machines. This one does that. You will be able to rotate it. Into 3D and then you'll be able to see, make sure that you have the right design file that is actually being sent across. So this is on the application and then this one is actually on the ICAP solution that we have. So you can make sure that this is the right design file and then it is actually sent to the. Machine and as I said sending to the machine is happening through Helios. We use Helios to send it and there were issues that we worked with AWS team to have a workaround circumventing the problems that IoT Corre has. So these files are huge files and IoT Core cannot support these big files. So we were working around. Doing some circumventing for handling those situations and then we were able to make sure these files are actually transferred to the machines. This is again, uh, a microservice that we have for processing the 3D preview, uh, feature, so. Sorry. So the user uploads a a design file into a S3 bucket using a pre-signed URL and then it kicks off a SNS SQS pattern into a parallel processing where one is we are doing heavy lifting, processing the design file completely, uh, and then storing the data into the post GIS database. The Second one is a lightweight, more of a lightweight solution where we are having. The preview generation, so preview of the file and the actual processing are separated out, and one is going to be heavy lifting, and then the other one is actually kind of a lightweight implementation that we have, and it is also served from the cloud front. So we generate the file and it is served from the cloud front and then the user is from the UI it is actually pulled onto the cloud front. And we do have, as you, as you have seen, it is having just in time target tasks that are actually getting created for processing the files. Now that we saw that, what is the lay of the land and then I have the to be state design and the operator has got it and he has worked on it once he does that, uh. What is the proof of completion of the work? So in certain geographies like Europe and Japan, you do have mandates from the government agencies for some submission of proof of completion of work. That so that they are getting paid for. So our, our customers who are the contractors would be actually needing this for generating revenue for their for their company. So after they complete the work, you'll be able to. Generate an export of the surface and it is sent to the agencies, so we do have multiple plethora of format of files that we can generate from the surfaces and we will be able to actually allow the users to download them so that it can be submitted as a proof of completion of work. So this is, as I said, the surface export completion is probably going to take a lot of time because we are going to have a huge amount of data that we need to parse from the from the post GS database and then parse it and then create the format of file that the user is requesting. So that being the case, this is an asynchronous process that we are kicking off. The user creates an APA request and then it kicks off an asynchronous process. And we generate the file using a Fargate task again and then it is actually stored in an S3 bucket and we use a lambda to actually trigger an email. So because it is an asynchronous process, so the user uses an email and then creates an APA request and you are creating the file behind the scenes, it could take anywhere between 5 to 10 minutes based on the surface that he's selecting. So for example, 10 square miles of quarry or a mining data that you want to process from a surface standpoint based on how long the surface has been stored for, we'll be able to actually generate the file and then store it in S3 and the lambda would be sending a pre-send URL as part of the email. So that's kind of how the users get the email from which they can actually download the file. I will, and obviously we are looking at, we are actually using the And complaint delivery tracking capabilities of SES. We were not having those and we were actually struggling to capture how many are actually downloading and those kind of things. But now that we have these capabilities in SES, we were able to actually take care of those kind of things. I will hand it over to Steve for concluding the session. Thank you. OK. So hopefully that was some good insights into how, you know, Caterpillar and the, the Cat Digital team are building kind of capabilities on top of AWS, you know, for their customers, you know, around their products. Um, and I really appreciate them coming here, you know, sharing their architectures, you know, their best practices and how they've gone through this, um. And this is just kind of one example of a customer that is doing this on AWS. Other examples are, you know Eunuchs, who are an Italian manufacturer of kitchen kind of equipment. We have Heisenberg, a German manufacturer, that do kind of printing presses, you know, HP, you know, with their industrial print presses also have done this. So we have multiple examples of how customers are building. Their connected product platforms on AWS and not just providing kind of, you know, insights in how those products are being used for that, but they're actually building services on top of that, as you saw with, you know, Helios, and you know and Vision Link, of how they can actually provide better experiences and better usage of those products to those customers. OK. Um, with that, I want to say thank you. I really appreciate you staying with us.
