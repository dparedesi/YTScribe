Hello everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'm really excited. I'm happy to have you here. So you are attending a session about Que Developer and Que Developer capabilities for SAP workloads on AWS. In today's presentation, we will demonstrate how Que Developer can help you, your, and your customers with either building theory applications, develop code, um, create documentations. We will dive deep in a second. But before we actually start, I wanted to ask you, did any one of you has already tried to use an AI assistant for programming purposes? Yeah, I see some, some of you did. OK, great. How did you like it? Did it give you any beneficial results? Yeah. So good, I'm glad to hear that. And today we'll present how Q Developer can help you as well. So I'm Shelley Cohen. Nice to meet you. I'm a senior SAP solution architect here at AWS, and my in my position, I help customers with a migration and modernization of SAP workloads in the cloud together with me, my colleague Harsh. Hello everyone, my name is Harshmdan Parwal. Uh, I'm. I'm also a specialist solution architect uh over here at AWS. Um, I have about 8.5 years of a web development experience and, uh, with AWS, uh, my main, uh, work stream is basically to, uh, we have different GAI suite of services, right? So we are trying to figure out like how we can integrate all these AWSS GI suite of services with SAP for betterment of our customer. Perfect. So just to let you know that we have prepared a lot of demonstrations for you, but we encourage you to ask questions and to raise issues that you encounter in your day to day work and maybe we can see how we can sort them out in this session right now. I'm sure it's gonna be beneficial for the most of you. So in today's session, we will talk about um basically about the Gen AI stack for AWS. We will mention it in a few sentences. We will dive deep into Que Developer different use cases, for example, for documentation, for code generation, and for conversion of code, we will. Showcase um the new ABA accelerator, the extension for key developer. Harsh will dive deep into this, uh, very important topic. Um, of course we will leave some time for Q&A, but again, if you have any questions along the session, please feel free to raise your hand and let's continue. OK, so let's talk about the Gen AI suite. For SAP for AWS or NSAP, so basically we have the new platform QuickSuite. Amazon Quick Suite is a platform where you can actually connect different connectors, for example, um. Outlook, Ojira, and, and other different systems including calling different APIs and servers and then build on top of them automations and flows and you can use Quickswipe on QuickSuite to build dashboards with only natural language. You can build stories and summarization of your dashboards. We have also Quiro. Quiro is the new IDE from Amazon, where you can actually build vibe coding programming and also use development based on specifications. We can have also Amazon Bedrock in which you can use to build uh automations also and machine learning based applications with the use of Agent Core, which is the new feature in Amazon Bedrock, you can build stand-alone agents for your day to day use in your companies. But today we will dive deep into Q Developer and we will talk about the Abo accelerator for Que Developer. So let's start So Que Developer is not just an AI system for programming, OK? It's called Que Developer, so the automatic thought is that it helps me to develop. But actually Que Developer is a tool that can assist you with the entire development life cycle. So when we are speaking about SAP life cycle for development, we are talking about specification documents. We are talking about the development itself. We are talking about theory applications. Theory applications could be on UI5, could be on BTP. So there are different options. We also support different versions of SAP, for example, ECC and S4. Are there any people here that still run on ERP uh SAP ECC? Yeah, OK, many, OK, so Q Developer can help you also with migrate either to the cloud, to rise, and also to S4. So let's start. So Shirley, um, I have a good question for you. So, a couple of weeks back, I was having a conversation with, uh, one of the customers. Uh, they are a big auto, automotive, uh, manufacturing customer, and their ask was like, uh, they have about 10, 15,000 of, uh, objects which they have developed over the span of like 15 years. And uh the thing is that they are right now, you know, trying to modernize, trying to move ahead, and uh the question that they asked me was, you know, all these objects that we've created, that they created, basically, the developer, they have left the organization, and they don't know what exactly the application does or the objects report, RFCs function model, all these applications too. So, is there a way that Q Developer can address this uh situation? Yeah, perfect, so. It's very customary that customers have very Let's say stable and pretty old systems legacy systems that maybe they developed the programs maybe 5 years, 10 years, and even 15 and 20 years from now. So basically what we want to do is try to understand what we see in the code in order for us to be able to extend it. So for example, I'm a former, so I'm a former consultant for SAP, a functional consultant. And many times when I came to different organizations I saw very old programs that the developers were not still in the company and the consultants kept changing so nobody actually knew what is written in the program itself so. Any time I wanted to debug it, which is very time consuming, could be very complex and frustrating, any time that I wanted to extend it, every time that somebody encountered maybe a bug, a little bug that we wanted to fix it, it was very difficult for us conceptually because it meant that we need to invest a lot of time and effort into actually understanding what we have there because we never wanted to lose the functionality of the program. So basically with the help of Q Developer, we can scan through a code, an ABA code. This is what we see here. This is just my Z program in the SAP environment. Here you can see how I actually use Que Developer on VS code. You see this little icon. I asked Q Developer to help me figure out what it says here in this code because this is the basis to everything. I can't really change something or I can't extend something if I don't understand what is written currently in the code. So I ask you, please review the code. In this case, what you saw is just copy paste as a prompt. To VS code in the chat box for Q, but of course it can integrate with your system with your environment and we will see examples for this later on in the session but what I asked him, please. Create a specification document for me. Explain to me what I see in this code, and the explanation is both functional and technical. So it starts with the scope. It starts with the purpose of the program. It tells me who are the stakeholders for this program, who would actually benefit from it, or actually who would have to test it after I do the changes, and then it goes down into details which are more technical what are the classes that are being used or what are the tables that are being used so that I would know what can be affected. It even gives me some quality recommendations for the code so I can improve my program as well. So we saw that we can create documentation, but if I think about the normal or the standard life cycle for the SAP program development, we start basically from the consultant, right? Or basically we start from the end user. The end user comes to the consultant like myself and ask for um could be an application, could be a program, could be a report, something he wants me to do something for him. And then what usually happens, it can be that I would go back and forth with him to understand what he actually needs to understand the business requirements, and then I would actually try to. Write it right. I would have to write the functional design. I would have to approve it with the end user. He will tell me, yeah, it's OK, maybe change this, maybe add that. And then I need to take this up with the developer and write the technical specification document, which is not very easy for me as a consultant, it takes time. So with the help of Q Developer we can automate this process and ask Que Developer to write the document that I want. In this example, I show you how Que Developer can write the specification documents based on the prompts. So if I explain to him what is the purpose, what is the objective of this program, because this is what the customer wanted. Maybe he didn't know to tell me how to write it or exactly what he wants, but he told me what his purpose is. And in this case he wanted to see how we can find discrepancies in the purchase order in this case. So discrepancies could be with quantity, could be with price, could be between the delivery of the GR process, and could be with the invoice. So just telling you that this is what I want to achieve. I want to understand the discrepancies, he wrote a full specification document. Now let's say that I approve it or let's say that I send it to my end user and he approved it. Now I need to create a technical document for that. So Q Developer created a full structure, a full design of how the technical specification would look like with structured, uh, suggestions, like for example, which classes to use, how the classes will be built, what tables to use, what fields, and all of this from just the prompt that explains the objective of the program that we want to write. So, Shirley, um, I have another question for you, now that you are mentioning about requirement gathering from the end users, right? So, when I was working as an AA developer, so we used to get our requirements for, you know, developing an ABAP application or an object uh from our functional counterparts. And sometimes what used to happen is, you know, some points or some uh functionalities are lost in translation, and we had to go in an iterative loop in order to, you know, get everything on board for our end users. So, is there something that we can do with Que Developer, you know, which will help uh the function consultant itself to, you know, develop something out of the box, like a quick POC or a demo for the end users, uh, that they can show? Yeah, yeah, so you know what happens, right, because as a functional consultant I have a lot of experience with end users that they ask what they want to ask, which is fine, which is great, and then I go to the programmer and I ask him to do and let's say that he does exactly what was required from him. It happened many times for me that when I came back to the end user, he told me, OK, listen, that's that's great. OK, it looks fine, but this is not actually what I wanted. Can you maybe add maybe a pop up here or maybe I want to double click and get to the transaction, or maybe add some more details in this header. So all of this could be resolved if they would actually see the application before I actually would go and develop it and ask the programmer to invest his time in programming it because otherwise what happens is that I go back to the end user and then he tells me add some more features and then I go back to the other pair and then the other pair tells me, OK, but I don't have time stand in line or I will try to do my best and then it takes more time so the development cycle is much more. Um, it could be faster, let's say. So, basically, a Que developer, if I use it in bus in Business Application Studio on BTP, you see that I can install Que here as an extension as well. And then I can use the UI features or the UI folders that we have here um for um uh basically develop the theory application or the front end screens before they actually create the program itself. So in this case I can sit, OK, yeah, does it work? OK. I can sit with the end user. Draw with him in the notebook. What we have here is actually a request to develop a dashboard for the production manager to just show him how many production orders are still open, how many production orders, uh, still needs to be created, etc. and create some sort of dashboard to see, um, some details and as you can see, I drew a picture, OK, like um. This little box with a few boxes inside it which are like buttons, so in each button I expect to see something different. Only from this drawing Q developer actually understood or scanned the page, the picture to understand what we see here. So he understood that I have buttons. I have a logic behind the buttons, and let's skip a little bit in order to see what it actually developed. OK. It has to play from the beginning, from the beginning, sorry. So in this, then surely that means like if from an Aba developer's perspective, right, so uh whenever we do an object-oriented Aba oops Aab kind of a programming, we, we have class diagrams and everything, right? So definitely we can just provide those diagrams to Q developer and ask it to build a class for us, right? Yeah, so basically we can ask it to scan the page, build the application, confirm it with the end user. You can see all the buttons that were created in the screen, and then of course if he wants me to add something, then I can do it directly in this session, in this meeting with him, and only then get to the developer. If you work with the UIUX team, in this case, I will try to run it from here and not touch it. So if you work with the UIUX team, then basically they will provide you a picture, an image of exactly what the application is supposed to look like. In this case, they will give you the exact colors and the exact inches, sizes and everything that the picture is supposed to to look like. So in this case we can just upload the picture with the metadata behind it. Uh, if we have it and then ask it to produce the um application directly. Let's see. I don't want to touch it now because I'm afraid that it will not allow me, uh, but you can see in just a few minutes how it actually creates everything. You can see, um, initially that it scans the documents, scans the image, and maps all the fields that we can actually see in the layout. It actually identifies the icons. And um also the sizes and everything that needs to be extracted uh and if I have checkboxes as well, and then it connects to the tables behind the scenes that it should draw the data from. We can also use mock data because maybe initially we don't want to link it to anything yet, but then later on we can. OK. Let's see. So you saw the image initially and this is what was created for us. The check boxes were created automatically. The columns, the selection screens, so, or the filters, sorry, uh, the titles, the header, the icon did not come, OK? So it's not perfect, it's not 100%, but you can see the colors as well. You can see the option to change the document. In this case it's requisitions, uh, but of course this is a very good start. Instead of the user to be able to build it by himself, you get it in one sentence. You just upload the picture and you ask it to create it and then it it being created. Now this is a very good base to start your programming. So if you don't like what you see or if you are missing some details, then you can also chat. You can chat with Que. You see you have this uh chat box, and then you can write the text of what you want to create. Ah, it doesn't run. Yeah, OK, so in this use case, uh, basically we try to create an application using the BTP, uh, features, OK? So we open a project and then we choose what format we want to use. And we get created um this LLV type of a a front end screen, OK? It's like a report. But what we see behind the report is that when I want to double click it, you will see in a second, then I don't get anything down because that means that I need to program the other screens as well because if I want it to be double click and create something behind it, then I need to define it. In this case it's not being defined because I didn't do it myself, so you see the screen is empty. So instead of going back and then build it by myself. What I asked is that I explained to him. The details of the documents were not created, so since they're not created, please build them for me. I didn't even tell them what details I wanted. I could have I could have told them I want the delivery. I want the quantity. I want to be able to edit it. I want to to create a pop up screen, etc. etc. In this case I didn't say it and I expected it. Que to understand by itself according to the business logic and the document that was created initially. So let's see what we got. So you see, I explained that it's empty, so it knows where it needs to um intervene. By the way, Q supports multiple languages. So if you're not, uh, if or if your customers are not from the US or UK then it's perfectly fine to write in a different language. Supports many languages. We can check according to you. Until now, do you have any questions? No, OK OK, let's see what was created. So, you see, yeah. One general question, uh, so. Which it seems like you showed a few different tools. So which are the tools that, uh, you're, you're actually showing here? And is it, would the same thing work, for example, in hero or VS code or like what, or is it what that, what's behind it that matters? What are the actual tools that are able to do all this? Uh, so I'm, I'm referring to Que Developer, and Que Developer can be, um, installed either on BTP, which is what we see in this, uh, example, or in VS code, which is BTP is based also on VS code. It can be also installed in Eclipse, and QO is based on Que, you can say. So all those tools that you develop. Yes, exactly. By the way, it doesn't work only for uh ABA or for uh SAP workloads, OK? You can create it also with other languages, other programming languages as well. So here you can see the screen that was created based on my, uh, natural language request. Just create the second screen and you can see that I have the option to edit. And since. understood the context of the document that is being used here. It allowed me to change the quantity in this case, and it integrates to my environment automatically. So in natural language, I can create a full functional application, not only the front end, but also the integration to my SAP environment. All right. OK, so. So until now, we saw documentation, we saw how Q Developer can uh can really assist uh functional consultants with either documentation, create a functional specifications or technical specifications, and also um document existing code, which is very helpful in order to understand what happened in our organization years before. We can also know now how to interact with our end user in order to build theory applications, something that is going to be very visual visualized with the end user in order for him to understand what he's going to get from this development. But Harsh, let me ask you something. Regardless of this, which is great, uh, what would it mean? I mean, about the ABA code, for example? I mean, if I think about companies that we saw, uh, are now they have ECC and in the future, hopefully soon maybe they would want to migrate to rise in the cloud or maybe SEP native in the cloud or just do an S4 upgrade. What does Q Developer can help us to achieve in this move? All right, so actually that's the same question um I had when I was exploring uh Amazon Que Developer for specifically for Abab actually. So, uh, the main challenge that we have, right, uh, for Abab development is the code compilation, the syntax checks, the ATC checks, and all those things, because unlike the open source programming languages like Node JS or Python. Uh, where we install the dependencies, the packages, right? The NPM packages, uh, PIP packages, which help us with the node compilation and all, code compilation and all. Uh, when it comes to above development, the code needs to be, uh, there in SAP dev environment like SAP database. There only it can do this in tax checks. It can act and it needs to be activated. So after running this in tax checks, we need to activate the object, run the ATC checks to make sure, you know, uh, the performance reviews are done, security checks are done. Um, naming conventions, if, if the organizations have, uh, their own naming standards. So all those things, ATC checks helps us. So, for this very particular reason, right, so we developed a solution called uh AAP Accelerator, which takes care of, of this entire, uh, you know, workspace. So how exactly a BAP accelerator works is basically, it's an extension to Amazon Que Developer. It's an MCP server-based extension. Which leverages uh ADT APIs to do the syntax checks, you know, to compile the ABA code, push the code actually in the SAP system. So whenever we ask Q developer to write a code, right, uh, let's say in, in Node JS or in Python, it creates the files in local packages, compiles them, and then we do a git push, uh, to, to the repos. For ABA development, the code needs to be pushed in the ABAB SAP database. So for that, we leverage, we use uh ADT APIs in AA accelerator, which helps us to do that. So why, why AA accelerator? So, other than what all the things I just mentioned, right? So, for AA development, specifically for reports or, or for classes, so we don't write the entire code in a single program, single SE 38 program, no. So we have multiple includes tops. We do data declaration forms where we write the actual business logic. We might have event handling, some classes or some interfaces which we have, which we might have dug up for event handling, some RFCs. So there are a lot of uh dependencies among different objects, AA objects, when it comes to a single application. So what AA accelerator does over here, it, it crawls through your source code. So let's say you, you make a query saying that, OK, you know, analyze this particular report for me. So it reads the first report, it identifies what are the dependent custom objects. And it brings those source code as well to understand the entire perspective, you know, what exactly the code does, what exactly that application does, to give you more detailed information. That's why we use a map accelerator. Mm, nice, nice, very interesting. And um can you walk me through the steps on how I'm supposed to achieve this, how Q Developer and the ABA accelerator can help me? Sure, sure, absolutely. So uh let's, let's assume a scenario where, where you know we are doing a migration or ECC to S4 or ECC to, uh, cloud native or rice migrations. So the first stage that we do is prepare and plan. So it's kind of a reverse engineering, you know, like whatever custom objects we might have developed, uh, we would like the AI system to understand Q Developer to understand what is the core logic, the business logic, and how we can modernize that code. Let's say if you're migrating from on-prem to cloud, so the reports won't work in cloud for that we might have to develop a rap-based application. So, how many of you uh you are familiar with wrap-based development, SAP's wrap-based development, restful APF programming. OK. All right. So, uh, the wrap-based development is, is, uh, nothing but uh SAP strategy to have the exact same application which you had on your on-prem system for cloud environments. So for that, the development starts from the base CDS layers, go all the way up to the service layers. So it covers, it, it basically helps you to create a theory application or an API or data V2 API V4 API quickly. So, that's why uh we, we switch with our SAP recommends us to switch on the wrap-based development. Uh, so the, like I said, the first stage is prepare and plan, wherein, with the help of a BAP accelerator, you will ask your developer to, you know, let's say you want to modernize a particular report or an object. You'll ask it to analyze, it will analyze the code, give you the core business logic, create a detailed documentation if that's the requirement that you have in the journey. And it can also not just create the documentation, it can store it on, on any of the uh shared workspaces. Let's say, if you are using SharePoints or Confluence, Atlassian Confluence, right, for uh share, storing the documentations. So it can store the objects over there. So, after, after the plan and prepare phase comes the development. So once we have analyzed all the objects, all the entire, the entire business logic, we start with development. Now, here, I'll, I'll show you a quick demo. It's, uh, it's, it, you can stop me in between, OK. Um, it's a little bit technical demo, uh, just to give you a heads up. OK. Let me switch. I hope you are, you are able to see the screen clearly. All right, perfect. So, uh, here, what I'm going to do is, uh, I'm going to ask you, developer to first analyze this and uh create a theory uh compatible version of this entire report, whatever it's doing, right? The It's loading. Just a moment. Does anyone have a question until it will be loaded? Yeah, please that the bottom is that. Uh, that link, no, that's an internal link. Uh, but in the end, uh, the, I'll, I'll share, we'll share the QR code which has all the demos and everything for you to go through again. Yeah. We'll share those details with you. By the way, if you want to get some hands-on experience with Q Developer and with the tools that you see today, then tomorrow there is a builder session that you can experiment with it. All right. OK. So as you can see over here, uh, we have this uh report which we normally write, and as you can see, there are multiple includes in it. Uh, the main report doesn't have a lot of code, just, you know, start of selection, end of selection, that's it. So my expectation over here is Q developers should crawl through all the includes, understand the program first, and then come up with a cloud migration strategy, like what are artifacts we require, how those needs to be created, which objects, which table it needs to refer to. And then we'll see how how it proceeds. So as you can see, the prompt that I gave was like completely analyze the report and help me create a wrap-based theory application that will perform, like, because we, we don't want to lose the integrity of our core business logic, right? We would like to see the same functionality in the modernized version as well. So it, it needs to be clear enough. And not just creating or writing the source code is something that I'm expecting Q developer to do. Uh, let's say if you use Jira, uh, you know, for project management. So it should be able to create relevant user stories, epics, tasks, everything for you, so that you can easily track all this development on your dashboard, Jira dashboards. So as you can see, it with, and this is what I was talking about, the ABA accelerator. So the tools that you see, right, uh get sourced. So that's a tool which is available in our MCP server. So it first gets the source code of the main report, and then it reads through it, it understands there are a couple of dependent objects, it brings that as well. And once it has all the information, right, here you go. So it comes up with the analysis first, like the core functionality, what it is, the key features, and then it starts creating the Jira stories for me. So, the, uh, so in, in Q Developer, right, there are, there are something called rules. So what I defined in rule is that whenever you're creating an object or writing a Jira story, make sure you're documenting everything so that later on if I want to review things, right, it should be easier for me to track all the things that it did. So, as you can see now, uh, it, it, it, it's looking for a conference page, it's looking whether, whether there is a repository that's already available, the workspace that's already available, where it can um store this documentation. And everything it's doing on its own with very minimal human interaction. Yes, please. Whatever Mhm. Uh, is it going to be dependent on You know what's actually a program has been developed, you know, how effectively the program has been, uh, created using the standards and things like that. I'm pretty sure it has some dependency on that. Some, sometimes, you know, you may, you may have created a program using some hardcore and things like that, so. Deal with the, the kind of the suboptimal kind of a programming. So, when you, uh, so let's say if you want to, uh, have Q developer to review your code before creating a new one, right? You can definitely ask it. So, uh, whatever knowledge it has, it has from all the public spaces. So, the hard codings, the naming conventions, the Uh, what we call the text element creations and all, right? So, it takes care of all those things for you. And let's say even if it misses in the Above accelerator, we have a tool for uh ATC checks as well. So, you can configure your own variant for the ATC check, you know, you can write it, uh, like in the variant, you can mention. What is the naming convention that you follow? What are the checks that you want every time that application to go through whenever you develop an object? And you can just ask your dev, OK, can you run the ATC check using the particular variant which you created, and that's it. It does it for you. And it not just runs the ATC checks, whatever issues are flagged in that execution, it rectifies those as well. It will ask you, OK, so do you want me to rectify those, or are you going to do it? So it will go back to the source code, make the changes as well. Uh, is, once it, uh, provides that kind of analysis, probably it is better for us to review what it is doing, what it has provided, and get comfortable with the output, or, uh, at least for some programs before you can probably let it go. Run the changes, yeah. So, very good point. So that's why, right, like when, whenever, uh, it's refereeing or it's uh recommending a tool to, to make the changes or to update the source code, right, it gives you the control whether you want to run it or not. So let's say it came up with the, uh, like, I'll I'll show you further as well in the demo that when it asks me to update, when it says that it's, it needs to update a source code, it waits for me to respond, uh, before doing anything. Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely, you're right about that. So as you can see, like, it, it even came up with a wrap base, like what exactly it needs to create, the parent-child dependency, uh the managed with draft scenario. OK. So, here it, it started creating the objects, but what it missed was, uh, the, it, it, it forgot to create the Jira stories. So, I just reminded Q developer that, OK, you wrote the documentation, but I need the Jira stories as well. So, I, I just uh told it, like, before creating the object, like create the Jira stories for me. And then it goes and does that for me as well. And in the stories, right, you can, you can have all the details. See, if, if there's a template which you might have created, right? So it will create the stories using those templates for you completely. So that in the story, you can read like what it's doing, what it analyzed, uh, what are the things that it should look for. So here it clearly identified the project which was already existing. If not, then it creates the project for you as well. And as you can see, it started creating the task, the first the epic, then the story, the list of tasks, it needs to be there. And you can review it along the way, yeah, absolutely. And by the way, if it recognizes something that is hard coded or something that it doesn't recommend, then it will show you and it will give you the recommendation on how to change it. And you can choose either to adopt it or not. And there was another question here. Yeah. Go ahead. ask Uh, what interfaces? Separate ID. I think, uh, so, a couple of years back, so I think the Amazon Q developer actually came in last year. Before that, before that we had Code whisperer. Uh. No, Kiiro is new. The Yeah, I think that that was a code whisperer that, that is gone now. So it's now Q developer, which is integrated with all the different IDs like Intelligi, uh, Eclipse, and VS codes and BAS. Like there's a bad extension for That stimulate we have extensions for voting and all. So for .NET, uh, I think it it does uh. Yeah, it has out of the box support for .NET. Yeah, right. Now they does not have I'm sorry, the question was not clear to me, right, response, yeah. For Eva we have full extension. Mhm. We'll get to that later. Activating What's that's that People their own life. Do. Play one. But actually there is Well Mhm. OK. The When Oi. A coding assistant so they No that There Mm-hmm. So that depends on you. So, in Que Developer, uh, there is a setting where you can enable, um, for basically, it, it analyzes your usage matrix, uh, and it recommends over the span of like say 2 months or 3 months when you use Que Developer continuously, right? It understands what are the day to day interactions you have, and then it, whatever interactions you had in the past, it uses that as a reference and starts giving you the recommendation. But that's totally up to you. If you want to disable it, you can disable it. Uh, so, for Pro tier and Free tier, there, there are two different tiers for Q developer. Free tier, it's always enabled by default. Uh, Pro tier, you have the control whether you want to enable it or disable it. Sorry. Yeah, that. So, if you, if you keep it enable and continuously use it for 1 month, 2 months, then it understands that, OK, what are the day to day interactions that you have, and then it comes up with the recommendations accordingly, like follow up. Then you don't need to instruct or give the instructions, very specific instructions, instructions every time. So in case of Mm-hmm. No. house. The scandals, to tell you. Uh, so what we can do? Rules-based development. Yeah. So, uh, what we can do is, uh, uh, I'll, I'll, we can sit together after the session and, and uh we can do a detailed deep dive on all the questions that you have got. Does that work with you? OK, all right then. Great. OK. Oh, you, you had a lot of interesting questions, so, yeah, we can definitely meet. OK, so here you go. So, once it comes up with the strategy, right, which, which artifact it needs to create, the CDS view, the base views, uh, the consumption views which sit on top of it, the behavior definition. So, it not just gives you recommendation, you will see now it's creating each and every object, doing the syntax checks, activating the objects, making sure that all the base objects are created properly because there is a lot of dependency when it comes to wrap-based development. If the base objects are not created properly, the follow-up objects will start failing. So it understands the significance of each and every step, and it makes sure that, OK, whatever it's creating, it's working. So once it creates the base view, then it goes a step ahead to create the interface view. Uh, I'll fast forward this a little bit. Uh, it's a pretty, um, long, this one. Yeah. The most important aspect over here, which, which I'd like to point out is behavior class implementations. So, whenever we do a wrap-based development, um, so once we create the serious views, on top of it, we create a behavior definition, which is, is, um, Aggregated with behavior class implementation. So what that behavior class has is the actual logic, you know, let's say if you have a custom field in your standard tables, right? So how those fields need to be updated, if there's a calculation required, or if you need to pull the data from some other tables, right? So all those logic comes in the behavior class, behavior implementation class. So, Que Developer, it not just creates the class for you, it will also generate the actual source code for that. For all those things. And the thing is with these theory applications that we just don't want to do get, like, you know, getting the data is, is pretty straightforward, but what is important is posting, like creating new records, updating existing ones. If you want to delete something, uh, delete capability to delete delete the records. And for each and every changes which we commit, right? There needs to be a proper authorization being handled. So that all checks are done at the behavior definition level itself. So, whatever code it's generating, when it when it does the syntax checks and activation, it makes sure that the dependent objects are also available before committing to anything. So, It does the syntax checks. Also, like, uh, sometimes you will see, right, um, so whenever it creates the serious view, there is a circular dependency between the objects like parent-child uh association. So if one is not created, the other one will fail. So it understands all those things. And sometimes, you know, like even with reports, regular reports, uh, we need to activate all the objects together. So it understands all those things that the objects needs to be activated together and it does the job for you. So it does everything intuitively. For the users. And what we have to do is, once all these artifacts are created, once all the code, source code is generated, all we have to do is review it, make sure that it's up to our standards. If there are any recommended changes that we wanted to do, we can ask you developer to do it, or we can do it on our own. But the point over here is it creates you a really high quality base, you know, boilerplate code. Which you need to just tweak a little bit based on your requirements. Mm. OK, so here it came with the behavior definition. All right. Now, here you can see, right, in the end, it created the service binding and everything for me. Now, what I'm trying to do is we can, we can view this uh theory application in preview mode, just to check what data it's bringing from the tables, right? So when I do that, There is, there is a small logic that's missing in the behavior class implementation. So, when I was, you know, uh, working on this demo, I realized that it, that it missed this tape. So, OK, I think I moved a little bit ahead. But, uh, to give you a, a context of that is like it missed a logic which it, which it was required to be there in the behavior class. And initially when I did, did the preview mode of the theory application, I couldn't see any data. So, all I had to do was just tell Q developer that, OK, when I viewed the application in preview mode, no data was visible. And we, I know that the table, that the table has all the necessary data that I want to view. And it clearly understood that, OK, in behavior class implementation, there's an additional logic which it needs to add, made the changes for you. And as you can see after that, right, after doing the changes, here is the final application that it looks like. So and publish, yeah, yeah, this is the steps, sorry. The booking stab was empty. So I just told her like, OK, this tab is still empty, it doesn't show any data. Can you please review the code and make sure everything is that. And you could also see, like, uh I'll show you in the end, when it created the theory application, it's not just one single screen. We passed through multiple screens, right? So it, it understands the requirement clearly. Yet, also it's, it is missing the create by association implementation, so it created everything for you. There is the logic of the source code and whatever updates it's recommending. And then let's say sometimes what happens is, uh, even when updating the source code, right, there are, there are instances where Q developer feels that, OK, there's a, it's, it's doing a lot of tasks at, at a single time. So it breaks down the task into smaller ones, finishes the smaller ones, and then in the end, it consolidates everything and brings you with the final, uh, brings with the final application. They got the source code here. There are some errors. All I have to do was just tell it like it's still the object still has some errors, and make sure you're updating it properly. Go back the preview mode. And there you go. It brings you all the flight data, the different information, the booking details, and you can even do the edit, like I said, the put operations and all. And once everything is done, once all the artifacts are created, it automatically goes to the Jira stories, update them, make sure that your development loop is completed altogether, like, you know, nothing is left behind. Yeah, uh, you had a question? No, OK, yes, go ahead. Confused about how this relates to the geo stories, so. What, why That's just for uh better development tracking, you know, so whatever artifacts that you're creating, it's not required, but just say you're using, you know, Jira uh stories for your project development or product development, right? Uh, we, we just wanted to show that Q Developer can make those create those stories for you as well and, you know, help to ease your development life cycle. Take a look at your story and do it, then update is that OK? Yeah, yeah, absolutely. So, uh, whether you, you want one single developer to do it or whether you want different developers to do it, that will be uh up to the development team altogether. But what, what we wanted to show over here is, so normally for this kind of development, right, it takes about one day. Uh, like without any AI coding assistance, like creating the stories, writing the stories, writing the documentation, and creating the final wrap application. And that, that's when, when the person is aware of how rap applications are developed, you know, what the existing source code is doing, what the legacy object is doing. So when it when they have all this information, they can do everything in one day. But what we want to show over here is How you can shorten that time span, development time span with Que Developer. Now, the same person with the help of Q Developer can achieve this task. So I did this in, in one hour actually. Within an hour, I created the documentations, uh created thera Fury application. Created Jira stories, closed the loop, did the unit testing. So even in uh SAP world, right, we have test-driven development where we create local unit test classes for checking the functionality of our source code. So it also creates the unit test for you, runs them, verifies the business logic and everything. And all this I was able to do in an hour. So we just want to show how it accelerates your AA development, you know, whenever you're doing a migration or even with your day to day maintenance activities. Mm, yeah. about He could bring up Uh-huh. There's a lot of meetings. True. Mhm So that is possible. Definitely that is possible, but not with this solution. This is purely for development. So for that, there is another solution that might be required, you know, uh, which, which takes care of the functional aspect of SAP development. So it can make the old data calls, get the data, uh limited to based on how many records, how many records you want to see. So it can do that as well, Que developer. So all we have to do is just configure those MCP servers, and that's about it. OK. So you have to set up if you have uh a legacy system, how do you then. Serve. Sorry, sorry, I could. What do you have to do like you have all these MCP right? So how, how do you set it up? What do you have to do to the existing? Yeah, so the MCP server, right? So you configure this, you configure the MCP server the same way you configure ADT on your eclipse, you know, where you give the host URL. Your logon credentials, it uses your uh username to create all these artifacts, so it won't do on its own. So, whatever logon details you have when you, when you configure your recipe system in Eclipse, right, with the ADT, same configuration details you need to provide to Q developer. So, we'll, there is a workshop next, uh, tomorrow, I think. So, in that, you will see how you can configure this MCP servers and everything. It's a hands-on workshop. I recommend you to attend it, yeah. It will answer a lot of your questions. Mhm. So, yeah, after the uh transformation, right? Like I said, the next step comes, is the technical unit testing. And like I said, uh it creates the local, locally implemented unit test class or a completely different unit test class for you based on uh your standards. So with that I hand it over back to Shirley. Yeah, so, um, I just wanted to invite you to scan those barcodes. Um, in the first one you can see the videos of our multiple demos that we have for Q Developer, uh, including the Fiory applications and the MCP server that was just demonstrated and all the capabilities that QQ can do. So I highly recommend it. You have the app accelerator that we just saw. You can see the pricing and you can also see the blog. The blog is very explanatory both on how to install it and how to use it and the benefits that it can bring you to your customers and to your company from different various um. Life cycle professions, for example, functional consultants, uh, testing, QA and also developers, of course, front end and back end.
