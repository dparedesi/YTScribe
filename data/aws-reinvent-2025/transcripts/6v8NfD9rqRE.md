Hello everyone. Welcome to STG 207. The session is Protect your data with AWS backup overview, use cases, and what's new with AWS backup. I'm Palak Desai. I lead product management for AWS Backup. Joining me is Bismman Seti. She's also a PM on the team. Uh, we also have our esteemed customers Chuck Uwana from ExxonMobil Global Services Company. He's gonna talk about his journey with AWS Backup. And uh Rushid Patel from JPMorgan Chase who's also gonna talk about their journey with AWS backup. So let's get started. We have an exciting agenda ahead of us. Uh, from a viewpoint of what I'm gonna cover today, we're gonna talk through, you know, why AWS backup, why does it matter, why should we protect our data, uh, what, what is new with AWS backup? So we have had an exciting year this year in 2025. We've had many key launches, and we're gonna walk you through those launches, but you know, you, you're gonna hear from our customers how they are progressing with AWS backup, what does data protection mean to them. So we'll round out with the customer journey. Uh, with Exxon and JPMorgan Chase, uh, our customers who are going to present their journey with us, and then we'll round out the session. Just to call out and I'll, I'll post the slide at the end. There are many exciting sessions around what is new with AWS backup, data protection, resiliency, ransomware in general, uh, so I'll flash the slide at the end, but please take a look, attend as many sessions as you can. All right, let's get started. Now we all know that data is growing. And customers like yourself use data to run their businesses. We use data to better serve our customers. We use our data, say for example, from the healthcare industries. We go back in time to understand how our health is progressing. We use financial data to make decisions which better serve our customers. In general, customers like yourself are using data to drive their business, so data has value and data is growing. So as a result, we want to protect that data, and AWS backup provides you with capabilities that allows you to protect that data. Quick facts, I wanna thank all my customers. We are greater than 1500 customers and growing. Uh, we refresh this stat every year at Reinvent and we are protecting 3.8 exabytes worth of data. So thank you so much for placing your trust on the service. From what do we do perspective, AWS backup is the native solution for centralized data protection. We protect data sitting in the cloud. All of our AWS state for resources such as Amazon EBS, such as Amazon S3, and so on and so forth. We cover 20+ resources that we protect. And then we've also extended in hybrid scenarios through our protection for VMware backups so we can take a VMware server and back it up, right? So we have that coverage from a viewpoint of data protection. Double clicking in, what do we really do? We provide a fully managed service that centralizes and automates data protection via policies across 20 plus resources. And as you can see, I'm not going to walk through the entire slide or each resource one by one, but you can see we have coverage across compute. Block storage, object storage, file storage, databases, management, applications, and hybrid hybrid via, you know, AWS, uh, backup support for VMware and SAP HANA. You see there is a new block that's emerged this year on the slide which is containers. I'm very pleased to announce that we release our container support, uh, for AWS backup support for ECS earlier in the month. Uh, at Cupon and it's well received by customers, so it was a direct customer ask for AWS backup and we have delivered on that promise and we'll talk about all the launches in detail in later slides. On top of basic data protection, we provide things along the lines of search and item level recovery, logically air gapping of your data, so logically air gapped for ransomware protection, restore testing, malware scanning, and auditing. So we have a slew of capabilities that we provide on top of the data that gets backed up. Some of the use cases that our customers use us for are on the slide, of course it starts with backups, so we provide cloud native backups for 20 plus resources and growing. This year we have added support for Redshift Serverless. We have added support for Aurora DSQL, and we've added support for Amazon EKS. So we have expanded the number of resources that we back up data for. You can recover from the backups for use cases such as disaster recovery. Say you fat fingered and deleted a bunch of files, and if you want to recover, you can recover from your backups. Say there is a natural disaster, an earthquake, and you need to recover in a different region, then you can recover from backups. Of course many of our customers are in the regulated industries, so they look for reporting on the backup posture, and we have capabilities built in our backup audit manager to provide you with those reports that you can serve to your regulators to understand how we are backing up, what you're backing up, where does it get stored, is it encrypted, how long the retention is, and so on and so forth. You can customize the reports based on your needs. And finally our key pillar is also ransomware recovery. A lot of our customers have come and asked us like what are you doing in the space when, you know, we are, uh, in front of a ransomware attack? Like we are, we are subject to a ransomware event. Like how do I recover my applications from the data that's backed up because that will, will make sure that you are, you are able to survive that ransomware event successfully. So we have a slew of capabilities even in that space that we have done through our logical air gap pools and extensions of that portfolio that we'll cover in this session. So I'm not going to go through all the line items on the slide. This is a, it's a handful. It's, it's an eye chart. So I'll give you guys a few moments to kind of think, walk through the slide. But as you can see in 2025 we have been very busy. We have, we have launched a bunch of capabilities, support for new resources. Breedshift surveillance support and Aurora DSQL, Amazon EKS, we've also strengthened support for our existing resources by creating one-tiered storage at a low cost for longer retention. For S3 backups, we have done enhancements on our RDS backups and we'll continue to progress on that front. On the ransomware protection, our notable launches and Bin will cover them in detail are around ransomware protection by enhancing capabilities for logical air gap volts and also adding malware scanning via guard duty. And of course we are gonna keep on uh working on our platform. We're gonna improve the operations and resiliency of the platform. We are going to work through performance. You're gonna see those continuously throughout the year where you can see the backups are being more and more performance, and we're gonna work on visibility and we will work on extending our platform to new and new new regions as they come up, right? So that's the platform improvements. With this backdrop, I would like to invite Bessman, she works continuously with customers like yourself, to walk through some of our key launches. Great. Thanks Pelli and as Pella mentioned, we've been really busy this year and it's great to see all of the customer feedback that we get from you continuously talking to you and and hearing what you're saying and being able to deliver on them. So I'm gonna deep dive into a few of our key launches of what enhanced capabilities we have to offer. All of these now are GA, um, and we will continue, as Pollock mentioned, to keep, uh, enhancing these as we go forward. So one of our first key launches today was enhanced, uh, sorry, this year was enhancement for logically air gapped vaults. Taking a step back, a logically air gapped vault is a capability we launched last year, um, for that ransomware protection pillar. A logically air gapped vault is a vault that is air gapped in nature and stored in an Amazon owned account. Those vaults by default are locked with a compliance vault lock to ensure that immutability. This year what we've done to enhance that ransomware protection is add multi-party approval, which essentially means that you can create a secure trusted group of people which requires quorum or 3 out of 5 users to approve any sharing of that vault across organizations or when a restore is required, say in a ransomware event. With this we've added this additional critical layer of security to the logically air gap vault for enhanced ransomware protection and more importantly allowed for faster RTOs because it does allow for direct restore outside of your organization. In that same vein, we've continued to improve on this with direct uh customer feedback requests. So the first is support for direct copies to a logically air gapped vault. As it stands, uh, prior to this launch, in order to store a backup in your logically air gapped vault, you would need to create a copy in your, uh, production account and then copy that backup into a logically air gapped vault. Now while we did that by design because that does provide enhanced capabilities of keeping two copies of your backups, we got direct feedback from customers who had different use cases in mind for this feature. So what we now support is backing up your backup from your workload account directly into a logically air gap vault for those additional use cases, and it does provide an additional cost saving measure, so you don't need to keep two backup copies. The second is expanding support for CMK or customer managed key support for logically air gapped vaults. Again, by design, our default encryption for a logically air gapped vault is an Amazon owned key, and the thought process behind this is in a ransomware event, if you lose access to your keys, you would still be able to restore your backups in the lag vault. However, we do understand customers have different requirements, compliance requirements, either internally or externally. So with this, we do give you the option to encrypt your backups that are stored in a logical air gapped vault with a customer managed key. So right here is a typical reference architecture of how a customer may be implementing a logically Eric App fault today. In the left-handed corner you'll see a customer's workload account where they are backing up say their S3 buckets and EBS volumes into a standard AWS backup vault. What you can then do is copy it into this logically air gapped vault for that second layer of protection and immutability. What we have at the bottom is what some customers do to manage the access to their keys and having a separate key vault account where their CMKs are managed and in this case using their customer managed key to encrypt the backups in this logically air gapped vault. Up top you'll see two additional accounts where the logically air gapped vault has been shared to for two separate purposes. The one at the top is a forensics account. This is where customers typically want to isolate their workloads to do forensics on their backups, such as restore testing. Restore testing is another capability that we have where customers can actually restore their backups periodically and validate that their data is there as expected. This, of course, we always say in the backup world your backups are only good as they're restorers, so we do encourage this for those very critical workloads. At the bottom you'll also see the AWS recovery account, and this is what we mean in terms of a ransomware event or any uh event that you might have from a security perspective. A logically Agap vault does allow you to share that vault across organizations or accounts, and here you'll see we. Added the multi-party approval access. So with that new multi-party approval feature, you can opt to have, say 3 out of 5 people ensure that they have validated this sharing of the account, sorry, of the logically air gap vault so you can restore it into your clear environment. I don't actually know. With that same thread of ransomware protection, we've also invested in an integration with Amazon Guard duty for malware scanning of your backups. So while our backups again are stored in this immutable fashion, we also know that customers want to be able to ensure that their backups are clean and safe to restore, and that's why we added support for Amazon guard duty. At launch and what we have just launched, you can now scan your EC2, EBS, and S3 backups for malware, and you can do this in two ways. One is on a periodic basis, so as part of the backup plans and policies you set, you can now opt into scanning these backups, which means that you can have the scans of your backups as the backups are taken. And therefore if any anomaly is detected, you'll be notified immediately and you can proactively triage the issue. But what this also does is allows for secure restores. We often hear that customers want to be able to restore to the last known good state of time. And so on this with is on-demand restore capability is that before you do restore, say you do have to have that uh recovery account and restore to a new. Um, set of principles in this case you can do an on-demand to restore it to double check and ensure that your backup is clean before you put it in that account. In addition to our ransomware capabilities, like Pollock mentioned, we've also added support and continued to improve our existing backup capabilities. So with this launch S3 backup tiering, we have provided a way for customers to find cost optimization for those long-term retention backups um over 60 days. So how this now works is for your S3 backups, you can choose to tier down the objects in your backup to a lower cost storage tier if those backups and objects are retained for longer than 60 days. You can choose and go in and configure when you would like those objects to be tiered down to based off of your requirements and what makes sense from your cost savings perspective. How this actually will work is after 60 or greater days, depending on the configuration you've put, you will be charged a one-time object transition fee which is meant to be quite nominal, and then those objects will take advantage of that lower cost storage tier. What makes this unique and is not a cold tier if you will, is that this has no impact to restores or any performance. Therefore, we're calling it a tiering option and it won't operate as a cold storage that you may be familiar with either from AWS backup or other usage. Lastly, uh, I wanna highlight one of our other key launches that Pollock mentioned was that we've added support for Amazon EKS. Well, we keep continuing growing our Amazon footprint of what we support, I think this is a really interesting launch for two reasons. One, this is following the trends of how customers are now using EKS and how that's transitioned since the birth of Kubernetes. Today we've seen that a lot of customers are now running stateful workloads on their containers versus stateless, um, you know, in prior years, which is what's really driven the need for this protection. So when we say an EKS backup, we are saying that we will back up your EKS cluster state, so the Kubernetes objects, deployments, and all the resources that are running on your cluster in addition to the persistent storage that is attached to your cluster. So at launch we've added support for EBS S3 and EFS that's attached to your cluster, and as a backup we will take a backup of all of these components and create a composite recovery point which will then allow you to restore either just the storage or the full cluster um and and to make sure that you do have that continual um immutability for EKS. There's no agents required to actually enable this, so you can now add a tag to your clusters or assign these to your existing backup plans and then back them alongside your additional resources. With that, uh, I'm glad that we were able to showcase what is AWS backup and some of our bigger launches, but who better to hear how AWS backup is benefiting them than some of our customers. So I'd like to invite Chuck on stage to talk about how AWS backup is being deployed at Exxon and a lot of their learnings. So Chuck. Thank you. Thank you Bisman. Thank you Bisman. Ransomware attacks. The deadliest threats that our digital assets face anywhere. On cloud, on premises, even at our homes. Nothing is immune from ransomware attacks. But that's why we're here. That's why we're all gathered here today. To explore strategies, tools, techniques. That we can use to not only secure our digital assets from ransomware attacks, but how we can recover those assets if an attack does indeed happen. And that's important. The conversation we're about to have today is critical because in recent years ransomware attacks have disrupted global enterprises. They have brought operations to a halt, corrupting data. Resulting in huge cost overruns. In recovery and reputational damage. Hospitals, healthcare systems are not immune from ransomware attacks. Some of them have had to turn away patients because their systems were locked, their data was corrupted. When Colonial Pipeline was hit by a ransomware attack. It wasn't just a cybersecurity issue. It was A A disruptor for fuel supply across the eastern United States. It triggered investigations. It cost millions of dollars in recovery. And ransom JBS Foods paid $11 million.11 million dollars to regain control of its systems and data. Now these aren't. Isolated events. These are business continuity failures with wide ranging national impact. Many experts believe that Ransomware attacks are a matter of when, not if. They are almost inevitable. But we don't know We don't, we don't we can't foretell the future. We don't invest in crystal balls. What we at ExxonMobil have invested in is what I call proactive resiliency. It is an insurance policy that we take out. That If an attack does indeed infect our systems, that we can recover in a rapid, secure and safe manner. We're investing in strategic cyber recovery capabilities, not just backups, but secure, orchestrated on-demand, isolated environments that enable us to restore critical workloads in the event of an attack. My name is Chuck Owana. I am principal application architect for strategy and modernization at ExxonMobil. I have also led A team, a cross-functional team of experts to build out what I've described as proactive resiliency. We did that in AWS. And today I'm going to tell you why we did it, how we did it, and share some key takeaways. When we set out on this project to reimagine our cybersecurity capabilities in AWS, our mission was clear. It was to enable secure performance and on demand recovery of critical workloads in the event of an attack and we wanted to do this for our global footprint, all of our resources wherever they're located. But we started with. A set of core principles, about 3 of them. The first one is Immutability We wanted our backups to be tamper proof. We wanted every time a backup is taken to not be overwritten. The second one was orchestration. Recovery must be automated and repeatable. We don't want a lot of manual intervention because when the world has ended. Our systems are attacked, we want to be able to recover in a rapid fashion. Last but not least is isolation. And isolation is key. It's crucial, because we want to ensure that recovery happens in a clean and secure environment. Because The last thing anybody wants is to suffer another ransomware attack while recovering from an attack. That's the last thing any of us want. Why did we choose AWS? Why AWS? There are a few reasons behind that. The first one is We did have previously, we did have robust cyber recovery capabilities on premises. But as we all know, It is hard to scale on premises hardware. It's difficult to do that. It's also expensive. It's expensive. It takes an army of IT professionals like me to go in and perform a recovery exercise, a successful one. That's one set of reasons. The other reason is because. Over the past few years, our company has been migrating. Mission critical business applications. To AWS. These are applications that have large data requirements. So we're moving our on-premises data center to AWS. Now Because of these factors, it made logical sense. It made strategic sense for us to co-locate our cyber recovery capabilities adjacent to our production systems, but air gapped adjacent. In addition to scalability and native security that we get from AWS platform. We do have. The benefit of leveraging immutable air gapped isolated systems. We can also use automated ephemeral systems environments that we can we can spin up on a dime. We can do this when we're testing we can do it in in recovery from an actual. Attack. The reason ephemeral environment is important for us is, well, it saves us costs. We don't have to pay for stateful environments for recovery when they are not in use. But it also reduces our tax surface. Because a malicious actor is not going to be able to attack something that doesn't exist. Now how did we do this? How did we square the circle of Our requirements, those core principles that I mentioned earlier, immutability, orchestration, isolation, how did we do, how do we resolve those principles with AWS solutions? This is it. This is how we did it. At least this is 50% of how we did it. I have broken up the backup and recovery aspects of our solution, our proactive resiliency solution, into two just so it's easy for us to review. This is not too dissimilar from the reference architecture that Bisman was sharing just earlier. Right, we leverage AWS backup. AW's backup provides the policies that we use to make sure that we write ones and we read many. We enforce those policies. We secure our backups immutably. In lag vaults and that provides us with the isolation. And immutability that we need. Now I wanna take a moment to step through the the diagram that you're looking at. You see the white box that is the workload organization? It could be anything at your enterprise. Production organization, for instance. And then we have 3 kinds of accounts denoted by the pink boxes that you see inside of that rectangle. The backup delegation account, the smallest box is. Is the orchestrator of this whole thing. It is the brains of the whole, the brains behind the whole operation. AWS backup. Leverages policies to orchestrate backups within what we call the cyber application account, and that's the medium sized box that you see towards the top of the rectangle. Within the cyber application account, by the way, that could be between one to many cyber application accounts depending upon your use case. At our enterprise we went through an effort to identify based on certain criteria what applications that we term cyber applications and then we leverage a tagging mechanism. To let AWS backup know to go. Back up the resources within the cyber application accounts and store them in a backup vault. I wanna put a pin on this because Bisman just shared a while ago that there are new features that AWS has rolled out in the past couple of weeks, the direct to lag vault feature. That is a real. Efficiency opportunity for our enterprise. Because previously we would stage backups in the backup vault. It wasn't, it wasn't, well, it was required, but it wasn't doing anything for us, right? It makes removing the requirements to store backups in the backup vault. Not only makes for efficiency, but it also reduces our costs, and I did the math. I did the math for our workloads. It saves us about 7%. That's 7% in total cost avoidance by just eliminating that. So that's kudos to the AWS team for rolling out the director lag vault feature. So within the cyber op account you can back up applications directly into the larger clear air gap vault, and I wanna touch on that because that's the larger box that you see at the bottom of the rectangle. Now the logical air gapped vault. Is the central repository for our immutable backups that's where we store them. And because of one policy they're not going to be overridden. We're still leveraging AWS KMS keys, the AWS manage keys, but thankfully the customer managed keys are now available for us to use in the cyber recovery backup account where the logically air gap vault is located. Now, the one more thing that I want to mention in this in this diagram is that we are doing all of this. All of this work and thought process went in because we wanna make sure that our golden goose, see, see the little thing with the halo, the backups are. Inviolate untouched, not tampered with, that's the key here for a successful recovery, a clean backup that hasn't been tampered with. So for ease of readability, I have brought in the Previous box showing the cyber recovery backup account just so we can see how we recover we restore resources from the logically air gapped vault into a new cyber account that we just created. I mentioned a while ago that ephemerality is a big thing for us. We don't want to pay for stateful environments. It also reduces our tax surface. So leveraging the AWS Resource Access Manager Share or RAM share. We can Shear, not copy, but we can shear the logically air gapped vault into a new cyber application account that we're trying to recover into. Once it's in there, We can find. A recovery point that our cybersecurity team has previously analyzed and told us this is no good. And then the restoration process for this is fully automated. Within a couple of minutes we have our EC2 instances that were backed up in the previous flow. Our S3 buckets, our EBS volumes, they're available again, all of that in an automated fashion. So that's it. That's precisely how we are enabling proactive resiliency measures in AWS. Now I want to talk about some takeaways. If you take nothing away from this presentation today. I'd like for you to remember. That the best time to plan for an attack is before it happens. Resiliency should always trump reaction. Always That's what we've done here. That's what we've done by deploying proactive resiliency measures to emerge stronger from a ransomware attack. So we used imitable backups stored in la vaults. To make sure that our data is not corrupted. Ephemeral recovery environments that are isolated from corruption because we don't want to be infected again while recovering from an attack. But there's a key piece that I haven't talked about up until now. Recovery automated. Recovery tests you need to test your backups for recovery as frequently as possible. Because if you think about it, When the world has ended, anything that can go wrong will go wrong, right? So you increase confidence in your backup and recovery processes if you can frequently test recovery in ephemeral environment. This is my, this is my favorite slide, by the way. So I, I opened the presentation by talking about ransomware as a matter of when, not if, the inevitability of ransomware attacks. That's why at ExxonMobil we don't rely on crystal balls. We rely on proactive resiliency measures, and I've shown you exactly what that looks like. Proactive resiliency. is an insurance policy. That When an attack does happen. We're not gonna be sitting ducks. We're going to have our ducks in a row for a rapid, secure, and safe recovery. Thank you for your time. I hope you enjoy the rest of reinvent. Palak Thank you. Thank you Chuck. So it's a great customer journey that Chuck just outlined. We have yet another great customer journey, and outcome with JPMorgan Chase. So I would like to invite Rashir Patel on the stage. Hey Roshir, great to have you here again. We have been working together for now the past 5 years, 5 odd years. Tell us what is data protection from um JPMC standpoint and like what does your team do? Yeah, so we essentially back up and more importantly recover the data for the firm and so from our standpoint we have a bunch of slides here that you guys can read through offline but we thought we'd make this a bit more interactive, um. We ensure that we enable the business to recover their data we ensure that resiliency and availability is there. We make sure that the solutions we have are flexible and that they're scalable, but at the end of the day, you know, you guys said this earlier on stage, no one really cares about backups, it's more about recoverability and that's what we've worked a lot with your team and yourself over the last few years on. The last thing you really want is you have backups. It's data that you can't recover, right, because you want to be able to make sure that when there is when there is a need, say a disaster, fat fingering ransomware, whatever it may be, you're able to bring your applications back up online based on the data that you've backed up, and that's that insurance policy that backups give you. So yes, backups are very, very important, but restorability is the key as well, all right, so. You have really helped us shape the service. Um, tell us how AWS backup has evolved to meet your needs. How have your needs evolved and how has the service evolved? I think 5 years ago our conversation was about data durability, right? It really wasn't about number of copies for us we're highly regulated and we wanna ensure that we have logically segmented and air gapped copies of data both on-prem and off-prem. So the solutions we've built over the last 10 years on-prem. Are built to meet regulatory requirements for the strictest regulators. So think of like Singapore Mass, HKMA in Hong Kong. So a lot of what we had to do with you and your team was to ensure that that's the same type of governance and the same type of structure and infrastructure related capabilities that we built out you could abstract and build it out natively in AWS and that's kind of been our journey of like how do we get to good so that we have the same. Parallel features and functionalities on-prem and off-prem, especially as we've been working at the last year and a half on hybrid workloads. Perfect. Right, so as uh Rushid mentioned that there are lots and lots of regulations and lots and lots of visibility requirements, compliance requirements, and banks like JPMC have to deal with, and many customers that we serve, and some of our requirements around isolation around reporting have really come up from customers like Exxon and JPMC. They're like direct customers. Feedback and this other kind of things that we have done. Tell us more about some of your key controls that you have and things that you know AWS backup has done over the course of last year that you can now influence within your, your protection strategy. So I think for us we have to be able to show that it's a backup, that it actually has a backup, and that we tested it. So we created backup plans and restore plans with y'all. So we test most our most critical applications and recoverability at a set frequency. So you guys allow us to do that in a pretty seamless way in a scheduled way as well we take that and we evidence that and so we evidence not only the backup but the recoverability so we provide telemetry on the backup so the ability to make sure that the backup was successful we show that if you have a. Backup that you certify that at a set frequency. If you don't have a backup, you'd certify that you don't need a backup on top of that, we look at recoverability, so the ability to wipe a host and rebuild it from scratch, the ability to recover from an immutable backup, and the ability to do an SRDR event. And so all those things we've worked with you and your team on to ensure that what we do on prem translates to what we do off prem. So the same controls that apply for us on prem are the exact same controls that we're using off prem as well. So whatever we do on prem to match those controls and evidence them, we work with you guys to ensure that we can do the same. But that's also spanned across new workloads, right? So as you we light up new workloads with you guys as a firm, we make sure that we can back up and recover those with you natively through AWS. We also make sure that we have features that are lit up per region, so that's been a big. Um, concentrated effort for us right as we've gone on live with new regions, making sure that we have multi-region, but over the years we've also looked at what cross account backups, cross region backups, lag vault that you guys just talked about, um, and all the telemetry monitoring that we've enhanced with y'all to ensure that we can provide the same level of telemetry on-prem and off-prem. I think the other thing that we've looked at is, you know, encryption at rest, encryption in flight, um, role based access, access management in general, um. We've looked at the life cycle of the backups, so we've looked at minimum retention and maximum retention as we. We seg segment what is operational recovery and we have a set time for those backups versus archive and we have a completely different system so we've worked with you guys on those four different types of retentions um we've also worked with you all on. The ability to ensure that through terraform it's tagging was there right and that tagging was something that's taken us quite a while to get right but that tagging allows us for the observability and telemetry and I think most recently we've looked at the alerting and monitoring. That you guys have in place that if you look at vendors like you know, CoECD, Commvault, Veritas NetBackup, it's very granular like NetBackup had 2000 error codes where you guys don't have that yet. You have the minimum things like long running backups or backup failures, but we're building out that granularity to match what we have on prem. Correct, correct. And as, as Roshir mentioned, we are enhancing our roadmap to meet the requirements of customers like himself and you all, uh, with fine grain encryption, access management, you know, all those are key to your backup. Posture if you will, you wanna make sure that the access to that backup is restricted. You wanna make sure that you have the right monitoring tools in place. You wanna make sure that you have the right backup life cycles and tagging is very, very crucial because as soon as you tag your backups they get picked up by the policy and that's the beauty of AWS backup. You just tag your resources the right way and they get picked up by AWS backup so you can now instill backup management at scale and that's what's been done within the bank. Right, and we talked about compliance and governance as well. You do you wanna highlight any anything specifically you do from a visibility standpoint that helps you meet the regulatory obligations? Yeah, so I mean like what we do on prem, when you look at like immutability we talk about. The same thing that we have on prem and off prem so it's the ability to have segregated credential backups to have backups in distinct locations. So we have cross account cross region with y'all we have lag vault, but all of that is viewed by the regulators as the same, right? They don't care if you have it on prem and off-prem. So we have to show continuous compliance that what we're doing in principle is the same with you as we do on prem. And so that continuously gets audited and regulators have RFIs that come through on an annual basis, right? Um, if we look at the overall alignment, I think 5 years ago you guys were asked why. I think now you guys ask less about the why and like, hey, how can we get this done and what's the key driver, right? That is correct, right? So service has certainly evolved, right? We are. Addressing more and more use cases and more and more requirements as can be seen in the 2025 launch this year we have come up with so many new launches and this has been directly influenced by customers. Customers are the ones who have told us what we need to do and when we need to do it, so. With this, it rounds up our session. I would love to say thank you to all of you for being here today spending the time with us. Um, there is a small survey please let us know how we did, what you would like to hear. There are more sessions on. AWS backup related capabilities as you can see I'll take you, I'll give you guys a moment to take a screenshot. Uh, we're talking about ransomware recovery we are talking about cost optimization we are talking about resiliency in general. There are tons and tons of sessions, uh, chalk talks, white boards. Please feel free to attend them, give us feedback, and let us know what you would like to hear next year. Thank you so much. Have a good day.
