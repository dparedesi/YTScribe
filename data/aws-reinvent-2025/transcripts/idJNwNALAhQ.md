summary: "Ajneet from Impetus Technologies delivers an insightful presentation on the critical necessity of modernizing legacy data estates to AWS, positioning this transformation not merely as an infrastructure upgrade but as the foundational prerequisite for unlocking the potential of Generative AI in the enterprise. He identifies a persistent challenge where 90% of enterprise leaders are eager to modernize their Enterprise Data Warehouses (EDW) and ETL pipelines yet are stalled by the immense complexity of decades-old business logic trapped in legacy platforms like Teradata, Informatica, and Hadoop. To address this paralysis, Impetus introduces LeapLogic, an automated migration accelerator designed to transform this legacy logic into modern AWS services like Redshift, Glue, and EMR with an impressive 90-95% automation rate. Ajneet details a rigorous, four-step methodology that begins with Assess, utilizing deep lineage analysis to map every dependency across the ecosystem, ensuring that the migration plan is based on actual data flows rather than arbitrary groupings. This is followed by Transform, where a grammar engine trained on over 100 million lines of code automatically converts proprietary scripts into optimized PySpark or AWS Glue jobs. The Validation phase ensures absolute data integrity through cell-by-cell comparison, while Operationalize establishes the necessary CI/CD pipelines and security governance for production readiness. Ajneet champions a strategic 80/20 approach, where automation handles the vast majority of the grunt work, allowing human experts to focus solely on the most complex edge cases—a strategy that reportedly accelerates migration cycles by 4X and reduces costs by 50%. Expanding beyond data migration, the session explores Gen BI (Generative Business Intelligence), illustrating how legacy reporting tools like Tableau or Cognos can be modernized using Amazon QuickSight Q. This capability allows enterprises to replace thousands of static, maintenance-heavy reports with dynamic, natural language Q&A interfaces, drastically reducing the migration scope. The presentation also highlights Prism, an AI-enabled observability platform for the post-migration world that provides a unified view across multi-cloud environments, including AWS, Azure, Snowflake, and Databricks. Unlike standard optimization tools that blindly recommend downsizing, Prism offers application-aware insights, intelligent enough to recognize that a costly, mission-critical workload should be maintained for high availability rather than optimized for cost. The session is bolstered by real-world success stories, such as United Airlines, which achieved a 50% reduction in passenger wait times after migrating real-time customer applications to Redshift, and Bank United, which slashed data processing times from 12 to under 6 hours. Ultimately, Ajneet argues that by leveraging accelerators like LeapLogic to automate the heavy lifting, enterprises can break free from the inertia of their legacy systems and rapidly pivot to building intelligent, AI-driven applications that deliver true transformational value."

Hey, good afternoon everyone, and welcome to the session. Uh, my name is Ajneet and I lead the solutions architecture team at Empetus. Today I'll be talking about, uh, how we are helping enterprises unlock the G AI potential with automedia modernization of their legacies, the data that they have accumulated over decades to the AWS platform. First, about Impasis Technologies, uh, we are empowering the intelligent enterprise. Uh, we are into data, cloud, and JNAI thought leadership, uh, globally, 3,600+. Uh, we are serving more than 30+ Fortune 100 customers. Uh, we are among the top AWS services and solution partners, and, uh, we've been delivering to 30+ Fortune 100 customers with a commitment to success. Uh, we have established a Center of Excellence, AWS Center of Excellence at Impetus, and that's where we are also the top, um, uh, service partner as well. Uh, we are premier tier services partner. We are number one in the, uh, ETL migration space. We have migrated a number of customers from their legacies to AWS Glue. Um, we have more than 10+, uh, services and solutions listed on AWS Marketplace, and we are G2E certified as well. Uh, now talking about the intelligent enterprise, uh, this is a portfolio of impetus Solutions, um, and the services portfolio now starting with the data and cloud engineering, uh, we start with defining and designing the data strategies, cloud strategies, DNA strategies for our customers, and for that we've also built some solutions and accelerators, a data platform accelerator that really helps jumpstart, create data platforms, uh, uh, a solution acceler. called Pres which brings unified observability and then we have solutions around data workloads and app modernization. I'll be speaking about that, but starting from, you know, creating those strategies, whether that's cloud data or strategy and then putting that to implementation. And successfully productionizing is is what we we we really have expertise around. We have a dedicated DevOps practice, everything from CICD, AI and MLOs. We've been delivering that to our customers, uh, things around JennyI services. We also have something called Jenny. labs where we really help accelerate the design of ideas and solutions for our customers and also helping them develop any rack-based frameworks that they want to create or anything that they want to build around agentic AI as well as taking care of any AI-based governance that needs to be in place. Now talking about Gen BI services, we've been helping our customers in the modernization space and otherwise to help, you know, put their legacy BIs to these modern platforms, leveraging Gen BI wherein for example, if you have thousands of reports, you don't really have to report or redesign all of them. Gen BI can take care of. Most of those reports for them for you, for you, especially the ad hoc reports and then uh summarizing all this, this is how we've been helping, uh, deliver an intelligent enterprise, an enterprise that can make very informed decisions using the insights from the data that they have accumulated over all these decades. And now let's talk about how are we helping transforming the data ecosystem for it to be ready for the GI era. Now I'll first start with a survey that says that 90% of the leaders who are looking at, you know, the Gen AI space and the AI space first want to prioritize the modernization of the legacies that they have because they may be running an EDW ETL for decades. There's a lot of business logic accumulated there, so they want to prioritize and similar number of leaders feel that modernizing all these data and using it in the GI era is the key to success. And at the same time there is a certain percentage that feels that there are certain impediments, certain challenges to modernization. Now we are all aligned to all these servers that are out there and then we have solved this problem with our tool solution accelerator called Leap Logic that really helps accelerate such modernizations. Now, before we talk about modernization, the first question is, How should we strategize, right? What should be our approach for modernization? Should we take everything as is the decades of investments that you have on your warehouse, on your ETL, on your BI side, but that was architected for those legacy frameworks, right? You cannot retrofit that to a modern platform. But then you do you throw that away, or is there a way to reuse that business logic? And once you have made that decision, there's another very important question. How big is this effort? Are you looking at 6 months of effort, a 1 year, or 2 years of an effort? Now, given, let's say it's 6 months or 8 months, what happens to the business as usual, right? So these are some of the important questions we help answer our customers as part of our strategy, strategizing a modernization for them as part of our modernization and methodology and approach. So the first thing that we start with is creating and using a balanced approach, proposing a balanced approach, which means that if you have a lot of legacy around EDW ETL, BI analytics, we feel that a balanced approach around, you know, taking 80% of that as is but modernizing it to the target platform which is pattern-based transformation. Now, there could be 20% of it, which could be the technical debt that may need, let's say rewrite or re-engineer, but we have seen this 80/20 rule works very well for most of the legacies out there. And then comes the methodology part. So what you see on the screen is the methodology we use. On the left hand side are some of the popular legacies we support today. So you'll see EDWs, ETLs, analytics, Hadoop, all that. On the right hand side you'll see some of the services on AWS side where we are able to migrate all these legacies to, and that too in an automated fashion. In the center you will see the 4 step methodology. The first one is assess. So this is the most critical part because this is where we strategize the modernization. So what we do is we look at your legacies, we assess them, and there are some key insights we, we extract out. First, what is the overall score? What are the volume metrics? Second, well, how complex is the business logic that's contained out there? Third, what is the technical debt? If an EDW has been running there for 20 years. There must be a lot of technical data out there. The technical debt could be the business logic, the technical debt could be the data around, or the technical debt could be the complexity of the business logic itself. We are able to extract that out. Fourth, we're able to do a lineage and. Dependency analysis of everything you're running on your legacy ecosystem today, which essentially means is we're able to create a mapping from your orchestration to ETL to your EDW and then to the BI and end to end lineage and dependency analysis and using all this information we are able to come up with the right strategy for you, right timelines for you, right target architecture for you, and also the right recommendations for you as part of the modernization. So once we have defined the right strategy and approach, the second step is the transformation itself. Now this is where the magic happens because the tool is able to auto transform 90 to 95% of your legacy code into the modern AWS platform, which essentially means is if you're running an Informatica or a data stage or a Teradata or an Oracle and you want to move that to glue and red chip combination. The tool will do that 90 to 95% in an automated fashion for you. Now, there's minimal manual efforts, 5 to 10%, that's taken care by the impetus SMEs. So what we deliver to you is a successful modernization within fixed timelines. So the transformation step is where most of the acceleration happens, and at the same time, we take care of standardization, optimizations that have to be implicit. The 3rd step is the validation part where we take care of everything from cell to cell-based data, data validation, as well as validating each and every piece of business logic that has been transformed. And the last part is the operationalization. So when I say we deliver you a successful migration, what I meant was that we don't just transform the code and dump the code and say goodbye. We make sure that we are productionizing it for you, and this is where the operationalization comes into the picture, where we make sure we are building the right CICD processes for you and the security governance processes for you, and you're able to productionize your legacy code transformed to the AWS target platform. Now, this slide talks about some of the automation levels we have. You'll see that for most of the EDW and ETLs we have very good up to 90, 95% of automation already available. This is the 4-step methodology in more detail. I've already spoken about it. Now, let's compare Leap Logic to some of the tools out there. So, if you're thinking of modernization, you're already into modernization phase, you may have seen a plethora of tools out there. Now this is a comparison of how leap logic is way ahead of those tools. Let's talk about some of those parameters. The first one is the end to end automation. You'll find the tools in the industry that may do ETL or EDW or Hadoop or BI, but in your ecosystem you have all of, all of those four. Now do you choose one tool for each, or do you use a tool that does everything for you? This is the first. So Leap Logic does everything end to end. The second one is, how does the transformation actually happen, right? Are is the tool just doing a line by line conversion, or is it really understanding the business logic behind it and then transforming it based on a pattern-based transformation? Again, leap logic really differ differentiates itself because it does a pattern-based modernization and covers all the workload types. The third one, how do you do interdependency and lineage? If you have an EDW that's running for two decades, you cannot really transform that in once. You cannot boil the ocean altogether. You'll have to break it down. But how do you break it down, right? You cannot break it down without any intelligence. You need to figure out how is the dependency mapped. This is where again leap logic differentiates because it has all that end to end mapping to plan a phase wise migration plan versus a very dumb. Chunking of your scope of work for modernization. Then the fourth one is the kind of automation it brings with 90 to 95% of automation, it really, really accelerates the modernization. Then what kind of validation do we support? A cell by cell validation ensures that we are doing a validation to the most granular level. The tools out there do not go to that granularity then. Is it customizable for the enterprise level? Let's say you're using some custom frameworks. Can we output? Can we generate the code according to those frameworks or not? Yes, Leap Logic can, but do all the tools out there do that? No. Then how do we make sure that we are adhering to all the SLAs and delivering the performance to you on the target platform? Leap Logic ensures that because while it does the transformation, it ensures that all the optimizations are implicit. And finally, Ensuring a risk-free migration with zero disruption to your business as usual because it has all that linear dependency mapping and it is very well planned, so this is what differentiates leap logic from all the tools out there ensuring that you have a successful migration. Now, how does that really help in the Gen BI space as well, right? I spoke about that other than the EDW ETL you are running, we also support BI tools. You may be running, let's say, Tableau, you may be running some other BI tools, and you want to modernize that, but you want to leverage NBI. The tool will really assess and tell you what kind of patterns you run today or what kind of reports you run today on your legacy and how that can be transformed to the modern platform and what G Gen BI can do for you. For example, a lot of self-serve reports do not really need the reports to be converted from Tableau to, let's say the AWS platform. Quicksight along with Amazon Que could really build those self-serve dashboards for you, right, which means if you have, let's say, 5000 self-serve reports, you don't really have to rebuild all of them, right? So that's the kind of Gen BI readiness the LeapLogic tool is able to bring because it is able to assess and tell you how Gen BI can really help in your reporting landscape. Now, finally, what's the advantage of using leap logic for any of those modernizations? 4X faster transformations, 2X lower cost, 1.5x faster validation, and overall compared to any manual migration, 2X less effort. And we have done this time and again. We have done more than 200+ migrations, all successfully delivered. We have transformed over 100 million lines of code, and the grammar engine today that backs leap logic is so robust that it has seen most of the patterns out there in EDW, EDW, analytics, and big data space. And with up to 95% of automation. It ensures that you have at least 50 to 75% of reduction in your migration and modernization cycle. Some of the case studies talking about United Airlines, right, they had an application running on Legacy today which really helped, you know, provide customers with real-time information. But since it was running on Legacy, it was really slow. We modernized that using leap logic to the AWS platform and ultimately delivered 70% effort and 22% time savings for them. It was a terror data migration to Redshift that we really accelerated through leap logic. And ultimately, for that application itself, United Airlines was actually able to reduce 50% wait time for their passengers. And 50% increase in the bookings as well, so we did not really just deliver an accelerated migration but also brought a lot of business value for United Airlines. Similarly for American Express, Tara, Nishho Migration, the application that they were running, we transformed that with over 70% automation. I'd like to also talk about how we help Bank United with their reporting challenges. So the challenge was that the data that they were bringing was taking more than 12 hours to be ready for reporting, which was defeating the purpose of making informed and timely decisions. With leap logic, we did the assessment, we came up with the modernization approach, and we not only delivered the transformation and the modernization with 85% automation and acceleration. But we delivered efficiencies that the the time that it was taking on legacy more than 12 hours, we were able to reduce that by almost more than 50%, and they were able to make informed decisions in a timely fashion. So this is the kind of transformational impact we have been able to bring to our customers. Now, uh, we've also come up with a new, new accelerator, a new product. So Leap Logic does the transformation, modernization. It really accelerates that. But once you have moved to the cloud, how do you make sure that you are continuously optimizing, optimizing your cost at the same time you're getting a unified view of your cloud span as well as observability, a unified observability. This is where we have come up with with PRISM, which is industry's first AI enabled solution for unified observability. So it does a number of things. First one, it will give you a unified view of multi-cloud and data platforms. So if you're using, let's say AWS and all, you're also using some data platforms like Data Bricks or Snowflake or maybe you're also using multi-cloud, you don't have to go to different dashboards to see what you're running and what costs you are incurring. You will get one unified view for it through PRISM. That's one. Second, it is AI powered and it has predictive analytic insights, which means what it means is that the observability insights that it will bring to you, it will also make some predictive recommendations. It will tell you that there are certain anomalies that should be sorted out and how they should be sorted. It will also come up with a recommendation around the spend. It will tell you where you are spending and why you are spending that, and what is the approach to optimize that. So and it is all AI based. And the last one is the intelligence automation and the government. that it brings, what that means is that it has an ML-driven forecasting for you. You are anticipating some good growth on your cloud data platforms, but how, how do you really quantify that based on historical data or what you're doing today? So PRISM can, can really come up with that AI-based, very informed forecasting for you. It also has the ability of smart tagging, which means you may be running hundreds of applications on a cloud. How do you know which application is consuming what kind of resources? So you can do smart tagging through PRISM, and the dashboard, the single dashboard that you will have, will tell you that this particular business group or this application is actually running these services, and this is the kind of cost that you're incurring. And finally, it also has the ability of, you know, making the recommendations for you across applications, but with intelligence, which means is you may be running an EC2 instance that is costing you too much, but rather than, you know, in a dumb way coming and saying, hey, reduce the size of this EC-2. The tool is aware that you are running a very mission critical application on this EC too. You cannot just bring it down or you cannot just bring down the size. So the recommendations that you get are very application aware and intelligent. So this is the kind of value that PRISM also brings. So if you've already modernized or you're modernizing to cloud, PRISM is a tool that you really need because this is what will ensure a unified observability and dashboarding for you. With that, I'd like you to invite, uh, I'd like you to visit our booth 1553. We're happy to speak about PRISMin in, in detail or leap logic in detail or GEI NBI. We'll have, we'll love to discuss where you are on your modernization space or what you are doing on the GEA or Gen BI space. At the same time, we'd love you to, we, we are hosting an event. Uh, today, and we'll, we'll like to invite you. Please do visit our booth. We'd love to have a chit chat over some drinks with you and speak about the modernization and others. We also have this hair, so we'll love to distribute and have you, uh, come along to the party and, and, uh, have some chit chat and some conversations around modernization and G AI with you all. With that, I thank you for your time. Thank you.
