- Good evening all, Srini Seshadri, global head of Financial
Services for HCL Tech AWS has been a great partner for us and we've just recently
signed an FS-specific SCA. We've also partnered with
Commonwealth Bank of Australia for the last almost two decades and we are extremely thrilled
to have Terri Sutherland, who's the general manager for
data platforms and operations. She oversaw what is probably
the largest data migration in the southern hemisphere,
and we look forward to hearing insights from her
on this pathbreaking platform, as well as other insights
on data modernization. Once again, Terri Sutherland, please. - Thank you, Srini. Hello, everyone. I'm Terri Sutherland, general manager of the Enterprise Data Platforms at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, and I'm super excited to be here with you today to talk about our enterprise data platform modernization and our strategic partnership with HCL and how we achieve the
largest and fastest migration in the southern hemisphere. But first, let me tell
you about the bank itself. Though many of you may never have heard of the Commonwealth Bank
of Australia, or CBA, as we call it, we are
Australia's largest bank. Australia's population is 27 million, and today, CBA services
17.5 million customers, which means one in three Australians and one in four businesses bank with us. Overall, 50% of Australia's
transactions go through CBA. And on the global stage, we are the 13th largest
bank by market value. And I'm very excited to say that we've just been named
the top four bank globally for AI maturity. I'd like to talk to you to you briefly about our data strategy and then how the data platform
modernization fits in. At the heart of our transformation,
are three core pillars: people, safeguards, and technology. On people, we recognize that a centralized data
team couldn't keep pace with our business demand to scale on AI. So we embedded data engineers and data scientists directly
into the lines of business, bringing data closer to
the people who use it and closer to the people
we serve, our customers. As a bank, safeguards are non-negotiable, so we embedded governance
and risk controls at every stage of the
data in AI lifecycle, ensuring safety by design. And lastly on technology,
we needed to connect decades of rich data spread across hundreds of source systems to empower
our federated data teams on the latest tooling. To achieve this, we established
a data mesh ecosystem on AWS cloud that empowers
our federated teams to operate independently, move data, and use data seamlessly, all the while, enforcing
strict governance. We call this ecosystem CommBank.data. Today, it empowers 40 lines of business, the freedom to produce
and use data as needed within a trusted and controlled framework. To enable this, we decentralized and adopted a clear
producer-consumer model. Each business unit now builds, owns, and manages its data as a product with defined roles and responsibilities. We've also introduced
self-service data sharing through a unified data
marketplace, a single pane of glass where users can discover, request, and consume data across
the entire AWS ecosystem. However, that said, data has gravity and where the data lives is
where every data scientist and data engineer in the bank will work. Historically, CBA held years of rich data held in on-premise platforms that lacked interoperability
and could not scale for AI. And so we made a bold move. We migrated 61,000 on-premise pipelines to our AWS mesh ecosystem. That's equivalent to 10 petabytes of data. The migration took nine
months with a hundred percent of data pipelines tested three times, that's 229,000 tests. And in so doing, we moved
our entire data engineering and AI workforce to AWS cloud. So how do we do such a
large migration so quickly? This is where our partnership
with AWS and HCL comes in. Oops, sorry. Early last year, we kicked off a series of workshops with AWS and HCL to test our most complex data pipelines and AI use cases to see if the migration to AWS native technologies was possible. We call this approach steel threads. Unlike a proof of concept or an MVP, steel threads prove the technology, but they also productionalize the outcome. Working closely with HCL, we built AI and generative AI that transform
code, check for errors, and then tested the output,
reconciling the tables exactly to our on-premise platform 100%. Every single row, column, and number needed to be accounted for. Throughout the nine month
migration, CBA, AWS, and HCL worked closely as
a unified tight knit team. We adopted this approach to
stop any potential misalignment, often associated with big programs of work and ambitious deadlines. We prioritized establishing
a shared purpose and operating cadence,
ensuring each member of the team felt a real sense of ownership toward
achieving our common goal. And now, with our AWS
mesh ecosystem in place and evolving our on-premise migration to that ecosystem in place and complete, we are ready to scale on
CBAs ambitious AI-powered, data driven-future. Would like hand over to Pukhi. I'll grab you this. - Thank you, Terri for
sharing the insights. I'm Puneet Makhija, delivery partner at HCL Tech, leading high performing teams delivering solutions at CBA. Let me dive into some of
the critical success factors that were for this migration. Best in class and fit for
purpose engineering practices. At HCL Tech, engineering is at the core of everything what we do. Industry is seeing a conversions of data, AI, and engineering, and we leverage best practices
across these paradigms for this program. We began early, strategically sourcing and deploying talent in phases to access the ideal talent pool. The data and AI lab created an environment that encouraged learning and innovation, helping teams to adapt to the program requirements. We improved test and migration quality in each sprint by use
matrices and track progress. Delivery construct for this program was truly outcome-based. Cognitive team topologies. We organized the teams according to the Dreyfus
Competency Framework, which helped us create a
cognitive diverse team structure. Connect pods led enablement,
scale migration, and automation and acceleration spots across the program. Elite AI engineers were
embedded in the teams to foster creative tension and consistently identify
ways to accelerate. Engineering skills uplift
and transformation levers. We ramped up our engineering team early, peaking at over 250
AWS-certified data engineers. We began upskilling and
certifications early, so our team was ready and effective from start of the migration. We shifted from specialized roles to full cycle engineering,
aligned to CBS model to deliver solutions effectively. In short, we used three
transformation levers: AWS certification for engineers, focused on full cycle engineering
and AI-driven automation. Automation and Gen AI. Developing automation
accelerators of parallel testing enabled us successful
migration of 61,000 pipelines and over 10 petabytes of data over to AWS in less than
nine months with precision and meeting quality objectives. An important takeaway from this migration is that we are committed to
incorporating AI accelerators for all future transitions and legacy migration initiatives. We are working towards bringing the agent-led delivery cycle,
ALDC to life in future. As an organization, we have embraced future-fit delivery model as minimum standard for
any search initiative. Last, but one of the significant
critical success factors, HC Tech strategic partnership with AWS. A significant factor in our success has been the strategic
partnership with AWS and a strong collaboration top down. The mantra, One Team One
Dream united CBA, AWS, and HCL Tech, leading to
the program's success. This achievement marks
the first of its kind, and we look forward to
future collaborations. Thank you.
