Cool hey everyone. Uh, I'm Nick. I work on the Project Kuiper, I mean, Amazon Leo team. Uh, rebranded, rebranded, you know, about a week ago, so I may say that a few more times, but yeah, we're the, we're building satellites, so we're here to talk about sort of what we're building, uh, what we're doing with ADS, um, and John's also going to talk with us. Hey folks, uh, yeah, I'm John. I've been with, uh, Amazon for about 11 years now helping to build the network on the, on the AWS side. Great. I appreciate all of you coming to like the the farthest flung part of uh this conference at, you know, the latest hour so I just appreciate all you guys for being here um. So what we're talking about today is Amazon Leo. Uh, we're building a satellite internet service. Um, it's gonna be a global service around the world, and we also are here at the AWS conference and you know AWS runs a global computing solution. So the answer is, you know, what does it look like when you use these things together? Uh, what are the benefits? What are the use cases, those types of things. Uh, and one of the interesting parts of working for Amazon Leo is we're, we're a space company, uh. And I've been working on the cloud side a lot too, and sometimes you're working enough things named after planets and other things that like you think you're working on space stuff too, but not really. You're just working on like billing for containers or something, um, and so uh I think we've been teased about space enough so let's let's watch an actual rocket launch. I minus 7 minutes status check to proceed with terminal count. Atlas systems propulsion, hydraulics go. Centaur systems propulsion go pneumatics go LO 2 LH 2 go. And I'm, go launch strike. You have permission to launch. Proceeding with 321. We have ignition. We are now moving at 4000 miles an hour. software looks nominal. Mechanicals proceeding nominal. All Kuiper satellites have been deployed successfully. Congrats, Kuiper. Great. So This is a little bit of what our constellation is going to look like. So we've got plans to launch, uh, over 3200 satellites into low Earth orbit. Uh, low Earth orbit is also the name of our brand with LEOs. It's very clever. And so, uh, we're launching at 3 different shells between 590 to 630 kilometers up in space, which we'll talk about. Uh, one of the interesting parts of that we'll also talk about is, uh, everything goes up, must come back down, so you have to build a global ground gateway network. Um, and so all of those things when you add it up together, your user experience when you use it, uh, will feel a lot like a fiber or cellular network, right? So we're, we're gonna be, uh, we're estimated around less than 50 milliseconds of latency, um, and our ultra largest terminal, uh, can do 1 gigabit down and 400 megats per second up and so you can get high speeds, low latency, um, and that's what we're building here. Usually the first question we get is how ready are you? Uh, where are your satellites? What's the status? So let's just cover that now. So over the last 6 months we have launched roughly every 6 weeks, um, putting anywhere between 24 to 27 satellites up at a time. So we got 153 satellites up in space. Uh, in 2026 that cadence is going to increase, so we're getting, uh, we have, you know, uh. Facilities down in Cape Canaveral, we're going to be able to work on multiple missions and multiple launches at the same time. We're also working with vehicles that we paid for many, many years ago and are just now kind of coming online. So the Blue Origin New Glenn, the new Ariane 6, as well as the Vulcan Centaur with ULA. Those are all bigger, badder rockets, and they launch more satellites up at a time. So our pace is going to increase, uh, and we're all super excited about that. So we should have service in 2026. If you take a look at this image in the center, this is a still shot of one of the many, many simulations that we run, and this shows you a little bit of the effects of our orbital mechanics, um. You know, I'm not gonna tell you too much about orbital mechanics, but we'll get a little bit into it, uh, and so essentially we put the satellites into an angle around Earth, but the way that it actually kind of shows up is it doesn't spend the same amount of time at every latitude, kind of spends more time at the tops and bottoms, and so the way that you will see service roll out is the closer you are to these kind of areas that are unfogged is the sooner you'll get service. So for those of you that maybe geography isn't your forte, um. You know, essentially there's that line kind of goes to US-Canada border and that also kind of goes through Central Europe and so that's the first areas where you'll, you'll see service come up and on the south we start to kind of down in New Zealand it's mostly ocean, um, and it comes up towards the equator so you'll see us roll out over time, uh, like that. So you know what we're gonna talk about today is, you know, why, why go through all this effort? Uh, space is hard, uh, you know, what are the challenges and problems that we're seeing. Uh, I'll teach you a little bit about how the satellite network works that way you can understand how to use it better. We'll talk about how we're working with ADS and where the overlaps are, uh, and then some of the use cases and what we're seeing from customers and, and how actually people put this into, into practice. So let's talk about some of the challenge here challenges here typically, uh, we see the problems are. They're based on how far you are from other options. So let's start close to fiber in the city in the urban areas. So the challenges we see here are, you know, you've got pretty good fiber, you usually have multiple providers, multiple options, um, until you don't. And so, uh, if storm comes through, uh, you have an outage, you have, um, hurricane, flood, bushfire, whatever your location, uh, suffers from. And so you know our terminals are meant to be outside they're hardened. There's a pretty good chance they would, they'll live through this, otherwise, you know, you pop one open from a backpack and now you can connect to the Leo network um on demand. So there's some use cases there. Then you kind of get a little bit further out and some more kind of suburban kind of areas. This could be 2 miles or 20 kilometers. Every kind of part of the world is a little bit different. Out here you have less options. So you may think for example that you have two different providers that are fully separated until our friend the fiber loving backhoe shows up and it cuts a channel, it cuts a bridge wherever it is, um, and now you have maybe zero options or maybe. The options you do have take a couple of months to show up and you need connectivity faster than what people can provide to you so we see a lot of use cases in this kind of suburban area. We get a little further out, uh, now we're in kind of areas where satellite communications are more typical. So this is your agriculture, your mining, uh, your far rural areas. Uh, when you're out here, everything is harder and more expensive. People's lives can be at risk. The equipment is expensive. The things you're doing are important. Uh, and trying to connect those things and make sure they run like they're close to home is, is difficult. And you get even further out now we're in airplanes and boats and islands. These are places we just don't expect to have Internet maybe at all, uh, and so there's a lot of things, a lot of different use cases we can do out in these areas that now it's, it's also something we can do. And kind of no matter across the board, one of the challenges we see is just the management of these systems. Sometimes these systems were built for a single country or a single niche use case or you're working with 30, 40, 50 year old type of equipment and it doesn't have the types of monitoring and management and ease of use that we kind of expect in the cloud world and so it can just be challenging just to manage these things. So when you add some of these things up, these are some of the bases that we, we think that Amazon Leo will be different. Uh, we're not the first people, we won't be the last, uh, but we think this is what's different about what we're building. One is the performance. So we're a connectivity service and that's just. What people care about, so performance is paramount. So anything we can do to reduce latency, increase bandwidth, um, but also the consistency consistency of that, right? Running a high quality network, doing it securely, right? So secures, uh, being secure by design is our, our kind of second area. Amazon in general has a very high security bar and so we meet that, but we've also, as a, you know, a connection you want to use and businesses that want to use this, we make sure that we've increased the security of our network. So we have advanced encryption across our network and we also have options that keep it completely off the Internet so we can do private networking options. Uh, and then, you know, being ready for business, uh, the way that customers want to be treated, uh, invoicing and management at scale and customer support and just things you expect from Amazon, um, are things we do. And one of the other interesting parts of working for Amazon Leo over the last few years is all the other things Amazon can bring so if you think about our. Retail business, right? The ability to ship antennas around the world quickly and have, uh, you know, return logistics for that. The ability to, to manufacture devices like the millions of Fire TV and Alexa devices, uh, we've got a lot of experience with that manufacturing portion of it. We need to build millions of terminals and thousands of satellites. There are a lot of overlaps there. Uh, Both ADB and other parts of Amazon have built, uh, custom chips and ASIs. We built a lot of those into our system, uh, to make sure that we get the right price and performance on the satellites. Um, you get to look at the cloud side. One is a lot of the workloads customers want to use in combination with Leo are running on AWS so you can combine your connectivity and your applications together in ways that you benefit from. But also just like. The process of designing these things we'll talk a little bit about like why Leo is is hard and difficult, but like control planes, multi-tenancy, uh building like strong APIs or things that ADS and Amazon have done before. And so there's a lot of really cool things we can use from Amazon to make Leo better. So, uh Bunch of things we can learn here uh I'm just crowd check how many are networking folks? How many guys are like astronauts or space people? A couple alright uh how many guys are like developers? Alright, that's kind of what I expect. So, um, so I'm gonna, I'm gonna teach you some orbital mechanics real quick, uh, so GEO, uh, which is short for geosynchronous orbit, uh, this is basically a way it's a, it's, it's a simple business model is, is, is what we're doing here. So an orbit is really just a fancy way of saying you're trying to fall back to Earth using gravity and you're missing and you're just kind of flying, uh, with style, so. Uh, the, what geosynchronous really is, is you're at a very specific distance. So if you're 35,768 kilometers from the, the Earth, you're falling in a way where you're just rotating at the Earth's rotational speed. So this means if you're a country and you want to launch one satellite and it's over your country all the time, you put it exactly this distance away, right? And so if you've seen, like, I don't know, watch TV on your sort of aunt's dish in the country and it takes like a second or two for everything to get by or if you've ever done a sat phone call and you have to kind of make like like walkie talkie sounds because the delay is so long, that's because you're going a very far distance into space and coming back, so it can be 250, 750 milliseconds just depending upon how they run the network. So we go, OK, well let's build this in Leo. I actually did make these like fairly accurate for physics, so we'll see if PowerPoint crashes, um, but now with Leo we're a lot closer to Earth here, right? So, uh, the latency, you know, it could be anywhere between 15 to 100 milliseconds depending upon things like the angles, um, if you're using lasers for things like things that move or airplane flights, uh, or just again how you run the network. So now. We're going around the Earth 16 times a day, right? And you can also see the beam is a lot smaller, so we're not covering very much of the Earth. So now we need more satellites. So, uh, I couldn't fit more on the slide, uh, but even now with like 50 satellites, we're not covering the whole world at any given point in time. Uh, but we've got a lot more control now, so the beam is smaller. We're losing less of that energy and that physics to free space, and if we, if we don't want to, we don't need to turn the beams on over the oceans, uh, and we have a lot tighter, more granular control. We're also within the Van Allen radiation belt, so this means we actually get more built-in protection from being closer to Earth. And so you know again some of you guys are developers it's like the difference of like running a single Postress database in your closet versus running like a full high performance scale cluster right now you can think about as these move around there's a lot more handovers, there's a lot more thinking there's a lot more complexity in systems like this and so you need to take sort of a cloud scale design uh to build this network. So, uh, let's take a look at the packet walk and just a little bit more detail. So we start with the antenna, it's built to be outside, uh, it's gonna talk to a satellite in space. That satellite is going to come back down to a ground gateway. And then that ground gateway is gonna send it to uh one of our points of presence. Uh, we used to be called Kuiper and these used to be called K-pops and so there was a lot of good Korean jokes. Those are now gone, um, so these are just our points of presence. That point of presence can send it either to the Internet directly to ADB or to a private, uh, network interconnect. If we zoom in a little bit on the antenna, uh, let's spend some time there. So one of the interesting parts of, of Leo is we've spent a lot of time, a lot of effort, a lot of our engineering, and a lot of the trade-offs we make is to make the antennas really good as opposed to paying lots of money for expensive things. These need to be built in an Amazon style, right? So they need to be, uh, they need to be rugged. They need to be outside, uh, but we need to make sure these are as affordable as possible. If you think about a lot of the parts of the world that don't have internet, affordability and the entryway cost is extremely important for us. And so these antennas, you know, there's a ray dome on top, uh, that protects it. Underneath inside is, is a phased array antenna. Underneath there's a heat sink, and then there's ethernet port. That's pretty much it, uh, but there's a lot of really advanced technology in there. And so, uh, these three units we've got here, the, the pro, the nano, and the Ultra, um. You know, the pro unit, it's about the size and weight of a laptop, and it does 400 megabits per second on the downlink. Uh, the nano unit is, uh, even smaller, so that's 7 inches by 7 inches. Uh, it does 100 megabits per second. And so this is really about the size, the weight, the power you want to put it in a backpack or you want to put it someplace where maybe you're doing, uh, scata or IOT type monitoring or surveillance or just a small amount of users, and then you have the ultra, that's the big boy. So this is what we see for more of our heavy enterprise use cases. It's around 40 pounds and it's about this big, so it's a little bit bigger. But this is also you kind of think about like data center class if you want to back up a data center or you have a lot of users, you have a camp with 400 people, uh, you want that full 1 gigabit, this is the the unit you're gonna want. And so, Yeah, let's keep moving here, so. Let's talk about the satellites. The satellites get a lot of attention because they're in space and they're pretty cool. Um, so they move at 17,800 MPH, 28 kilometers if, if you like other types of units. Um, this also means they're only over a certain part of Earth for 30, 60, 90 seconds usually, um, just based on the speed that they're going at, which means one of the interesting things that we do from the networking that we build is it's all preprogrammed. So the hard part about getting things into space is getting there. The easy part is predicting where it's going to be in the future, right? So these orbits are highly predictable. We know where those are going to be. We know where the terminals are going to be. We know where the ground gateways are going to be, and we can pre-calculate all those topologies. There's also lasers as well, which we'll talk about, so we can figure out what the network needs to look like, which frequencies are used where, uh, which terminals are going to talk to who, when they're going to hand off, and we can be extremely accurate with those things. So it's a really cool network engineering project. Uh When I say they're predictable, some of the things that are not is they do sometimes need to use the propulsion. So we have propulsion on board. This allows us to do a couple of different things. One is we can come in at a lower altitude, raise the orbit once it's been tested and it's clean and good. Also on orbit, if there's any chances of debris or other things we need to to do avoidance maneuvers, we can do that. And once the satellite is done, we slow the satellite down and it burns up peacefully in the Earth's atmosphere. So, uh, we can talk about sustainability uh in a lot of different ways, um, essentially we're doing a lot of work there, um. That's usually the first question we get. Cool, let's talk about the lasers. So lasers have a couple different use cases, uh. The first and kind of probably most obvious to folks is, you know, hey, you're out in the middle of the ocean, you're on a boat, you're on an airplane, and there's no, there's no ground gateway near you. So the lasers allow us to have a greater reach. So you go up to the satellite, you go. Uh, I'm legally required to do that. And then you come back down to a ground gateway. Uh, and so it's, it's one, it's about the reach, but also, you know, if that ground gateway has an issue or if there's a storm there or if there's a fiber cut or if there's antennas having issues, uh, you can use those lasers to get to more options, so it gives you optionality and how you build the network as well. So yeah, they have 4 different lasers that can go kind of north, south, east, west, and you can build this kind of flexible, kind of like think of like a space backbone, and it gives us some options on how to route our, our, our traffic. Then we have the ground gateways. So this is a picture of those usually they're gonna be, you know, 5 g gateways just hanging out in a field somewhere, um, and these are super important for us. So if you think about there might be hundreds or thousands of these terminals on the left and the satellites talking to, you know, 1 or 2 ground gateways. So it's kind of in networking terms it's your uplink. It's, it's, it's very important for the overall network bandwidth. This is also how we'll eventually, you know, reduce all the latency, so the closer that gateway is to where you want to go, um, you spend less time messing around in space. And so, uh, this scales scales out. So this is where we use the AWS network. Uh, we need to put that gateway somewhere near a network to get it to where you want to go. And so that's part of what we're gonna talk about here. So the gateway basically takes the RF and puts it on, on the ground network. Uh, you think about space a lot, but most of the latency, most of the hard parts of this actually are, are, are just typical ground networking. And then we get to the pop. So the PO then can make a routing decision. So you can take that if you're running a workload, you don't want to touch the internet, we can take that directly into your AWS environment. If you have a data center or another cloud you wanna work with, uh, that's where we would do a private network interconnect. We can do a peering with you and you can take that traffic privately privately there. Otherwise you can go to the internet. That one's pretty straightforward. So now you guys are all satellite experts, which is great news, um, but there might be some challenges that are still a little bit hard to to sort of visualize. So one is just building a global network is difficult, so we have to do this in many, many places all kind of at the same time, um. And Earth is just kind of a large place, so there's a scale problem and And this is all to talk about like you know some of our networking challenges which we're gonna get into. So then it's about performance. OK, you're going to space and back, you have to do this globally everywhere, um, but how do you also reduce the latency and increase performance because again that's what people care about. And you kind of wanna design it once, you know, you think about your cloud design, you don't want 16 of those, uh, but you know, building in a small country in Africa is much different than building a large country in Asia versus, you know, something down in South America. And so we have to make a lot of different choices about where we're at in the world. Um, sometimes it's based on their local laws and regulations, or sometimes it's based on just the demand. So think about us needing to choose, do we use the AWS region? Do we use the AOS local zone, or do we use AWS outpost, and that sort of like. All those choices we need to make and then there's making this a global easily managed network across the world. If I have 1000 terminals and they're spread across countries, how do I do this using like that sort of cloud scale management that we all want. So to give you an idea, right, um, if you have to design the Leo network and you wanna put the 1st 8 gateways, you can kinda, you can kinda figure that out, you know, some places where we'll have coverage, places where we have demand, there's some obvious places to do this. If you're building 300 gateways, where are you gonna put all those things, right? And so this is an example of one of the networking challenges if you decide you want to build, uh, a Leo network as well, um, that you'll have to solve. And so for us, uh, there's a big advantage for using the, the Abus network. And so to, to help you guys understand that and what it looks like and, and why we've done this, um, John's gonna come up and, and talk about networking things. Thanks, John. Yeah, uh, thanks, Nick. Uh, yeah, hey folks, uh, my name is Jonathan Philibert. I'm a principal network development engineer in the AWS global infrastructure services space. Uh, I work on a team called Internet Edge. Uh, it is exactly like it sounds. I work on the parts of the network very close to the internet, way out at the edge, away from the data centers. Uh, one of our favorite things to do is work with the people that are building the services on AWS, hearing about their unique challenges, uh, especially when we get to help solve some of those challenges. Uh, that's how we started working with Amazon Leo. They were facing some unique challenges and by building an AWS they were able to accomplish some pretty cool things. So yeah, I'm here to introduce you to Internet Edge, uh, some of the unique things that we offer and, uh, how Amazon Leo was able to leverage us to build a highly resilient, highly performance, and uh very secure service. So if you've been, uh, if you've been to, you know, some of the AWS Global infrastructure Services, uh, presentations before, uh, you may know that we run a very large network. Uh, it didn't start that way. It actually started very modestly way back in the early 2010s. Uh, back then we were sending traffic out over the open internet between the regions, didn't really provide the kind of experience that we were looking for it. It wasn't very reliable. It wasn't very performance, um, so we started on this journey to build a backbone. As the story goes, uh, it is now massive, right? Uh, it now interconnects our 38 regions globally with over 200 internet edge points of presence that we used to exchange traffic with the internet. Uh, this also includes our 145 direct connect pops that we use to exchange traffic with on-prime networks. Uh, this is distributed over 100, uh, it was distributed over 110 metropolitan areas in 58 countries. Uh, all said and done, this allows us to exchange traffic with over 5000 internet peers. Uh, when you take redundancy into account, it's a lot of capacity for the internet. When all this capacity, when all this interconnection is laid out on a map, this is what it looks like. It represents over 9 million kilometers of terrestrial and subsea fiber optic cabling. It's a lot of cable. It's a lot of fiber, uh, it's actually enough fiber to loop between us and the moon and back more than 11 times. What's even more phenomenal is the growth that we are experiencing. We're adding more fiber to it every day. Uh, just in the past 12 months we've experienced an 80% growth. This growth has made it vital that we invest in automation. Uh, the network is just too big, uh, for humans to, to, to, to manage by themselves, uh, so 96% of, uh, network events are remediated without a human ever being involved. You may have also heard that Amazon takes security very seriously. This applies to the network too. When we were designing it, we wanted to make sure that security was first. It was designed with security in mind. Uh, we've done that by utilizing a technology called Maxec. It's a layer to encryption, and we use it, uh, by encrypting data between the regions, between the data centers, uh, at very close to the physical layer, uh, when they leave secured AWS, uh, locations. Since we do have this secured internal network, we wanted to make sure that the workloads running within AWS benefit from it. We do that by ensuring that the traffic stays on our encrypted paths, uh. When traffic is traffic between the regions, it should stay inside Amazon and never go out to the public internet. Uh, all that fiber I was talking about means that, uh, we should always have enough internal capacity available to fail over to rather than sending traffic out to the open internet. Of course, there are workloads within AWS uh that do need to speak with the internet. Uh we've thought long and hard about how we can improve the the security and the reliability of uh that type of traffic too. One of the ways that we've done that is using a resource public key infrastructure or RPKI. Uh, it allows the participants of the Internet to cryptographically verify that the routing information they receive is accurate and uh legitimate. It helps prevent traffic from taking unintended or unreliable paths as it is routed across the Internet. You know, it seems like ancient history, but it was probably like 2 or 3 years ago, uh, where it seemed like every week we were uh detecting our traffic taking unexpected paths. But you know lately, uh, more recently, RPTI has done a phenomenal job of preventing these events. It allows these networks to to detect the bad routing information and ignore it and drop it, ensuring that traffic only takes reliable paths, the paths that we expect when it goes across the internet. We've also, we've, we've also done some pretty cool things with traffic engineering. Uh, we monitor traffic as it goes through the Internet. Uh, we collect metrics, we collect, uh, uh, reliability information and, uh, statistics around performance, and we use that data to make decisions about where we should send our customer traffic. We ignore sometimes the, the typical routing protocols that run the Internet and instead make our data back decisions. So, uh, the people who are building on top of AWS, they just want to focus on running a great service. They don't want to have to worry about what it means to use public IPs and, uh, you know, accept connections from the internet. Unfortunately, the internet doesn't always work like that. Uh, there are bad actors out there that will find a service and just throw junk packets at it, uh, in a bid to disrupt or deny a service to your users. Uh, we call these distributed denial of service mitigation, uh, attacks or, uh, DDoS attacks. That's why we have AWS shields, uh, in each of our 200, more than 200 facilities where we pair with the internet, uh, we have deployed our custom homegrown hardware, uh, that will detect this traffic. It will then redirect it, uh, drop the bad traffic, and then, uh, allow the good traffic through, ensuring that your service is uninterrupted. We experience millions of these attacks every year. It is constant, uh, and it really underscores, uh, the benefit that AWS Shield provides to not just the infrastructure but all of the software running on top of it as well. Oh, And so what's great is, you know, there's a lot of this security that's built into the way that ABS runs their network, uh, but like I mentioned before, we really care about the security of the Leo network as well. And so what we've done is we've added additional security and encryption on top of what's built in, uh, to the 8 of us parts that we're using. So one of the things that we do is when our antenna receives traffic, we basically put an envelope encryption on there and we send it all the way through to our pop. And so this means practically speaking if someone was to go I don't know, break into the ground gateway site and try to, you know, sniff the wire there all they're getting is cipher text, right? There's nothing there if someone was to be a little more sort of ambitious and go into space and steal a satellite, um, also they're just gonna get cipher text and so the idea is across our network we're using advanced encryption to make sure that uh we have encryption across our network. Uh, we also have a handful of some ISO specs, so ISO 27,0001 and 22301, um, for organizations that want sort of proof that, you know, we're doing things the right way and there's controls and other things, so security is built in, uh, kind of from the ground up and something we take really, really seriously. Thank you. Alright, so what are some of the, what are some of the unique challenges that uh Amazon Leo faced and how did building on AWS help them solve it? Well, 00, sorry, uh, uh, well, Amazon, Amazon Leo is, uh, building this giant constellation in space, right? Uh, they're sending all this traffic up to it, uh, but at the end of the day, the contents, uh, still lives down here on Earth. Well, uh, the AWS edge sites are advantageous in this way because they already exist in the places where Amazon Leo wants to send their traffic. By building on top of AWS, uh, Amazon Leo can benefit from a terrestrial network that already exists. It also just so happens to be, uh, the cloud network that is uh the highest throughput and the lowest latency, uh. AWS uh helps LEO uh provide its service in more locations faster. Uh, it allows them to focus on their core business challenges like uh building out that that giant space, uh, that giant satellite constellation and operating their lasers in space. Our edge sites are also advantageous because of their proximity to other networks. Uh, these facilities, uh, they are where internet exchange occurs. They, they, they, it's where networks, uh, meet to, uh, exchange traffic with one another. Uh, but it's also where, where, where AWS, uh, deploys services, right? Services like Cloudfront, RoughD3, AGA, uh, sorry, AWS Global Accelerator, um. These are services that want to be right at the edge of the network, right? They want to be, they want to have very close access to these other networks so that they can be close to the users that may be requesting the content from these services. Now that Amazon Leo was built on AWS, they will also benefit from having this close proximity to these services and external networks. Having this close proximity to the networks and to the services is, is, uh, is vital for a great customer experience. It drives down latency and, uh, you know, Amazon Leo is designing their service to be as low latency as possible. We know that the path from the antenna up to the satellite and back down to the ground gateway is already about 10 milliseconds, right? Uh, the path from the ground gateway into the Amazon or the AWS network can add another 12 milliseconds. We expect it, we expect this to come down over time as those additional ground gateways are deployed, but at launch it will be about 12 milliseconds. We are bound by the laws of physics here. Uh, the data is being transmitted at the speed of light and we can't make light travel any faster. So, the only way that we can optimize latency is by limiting the distance that the data has to travel. That is exactly what Amazon Leo is doing. By deploying, uh, by deploying globally into the location where the internet exchange occurs, they are positioning themselves to be, uh, physically close to the content that is important to their customers, right? Whether it's, you know, the latest applications running in AC2, uh, an on-prem network via DX, or, uh, the latest cat memes coming from the internet. Uh, the other impressive thing about, uh, that, that Amazon Leo gains by building on top of AWS is the amount of resiliency that is built into the service, right? Um. We've already established uh that uh. These, uh, the AWS edge sites are present in the locations where where Amazon Leo wants to send their traffic, um. That means they can deploy the ground gateways that they'll need and never be too far away from AWS. Uh, since the AWS network is global, any of the ground gateways, uh, can be used to reach any of the Amazon Leo points of presence. If the ground gateways experience any problems for whatever reason, uh, the, the satellite constellation can choose to send the traffic to a different ground gateway, and that that ground gateway will be able to reach any of the Amazon Leo points of presence. We also see here that the ground gateways have the option of having redundant connections into the Amazon network. This can be especially handy if we run into one of the fiber seeking backhoes. Even Amazon is not immune to the fiber seeking backhoe. So if one of the paths gets dug up, the ground gateway can simply use the redundant path to land the traffic into the Amazon network. Finally, uh, by building on top of AWS, Amazon Leo has the ability to make their points of presence entirely redundant as well. Uh By building on top of AWS, uh, uh, Leo, uh, Leo has been, Leo has, has been able to build an impressive amount of resiliency into their service, uh, that should allow you, if you choose to build on, uh, Amazon Leo, uh, to build an, uh, in a very resilient service as well. I'll now hand back to Nick for uh the enterprise preview. Cool, thanks, John. So yeah, uh, one of the questions we usually get from folks is, you know, hey, we're both Amazon companies between Abis and Amazon Leo. What does it look like, you know, what are the integrations and, and, you know, what does that entail? So, uh, last week, if you missed it, uh, we announced our enterprise preview. So it means, uh, we're taking interest from customers that wanna start testing, and we're starting all that testing here very, very shortly. So let's walk through what it actually is gonna look like to use Amazon Leo and I can kinda show you what the integrations look like, you know, kind of along that journey. So, uh, to start off, I mean you can go to our website now. We're out on Leo.amazon.com. You can click on business and learn a little about use cases and other things. Uh, when we go available, you'll be able to go from there and click into the, the Leo Enterprise console. So, uh, the way that you log into that console is by using your AWS credentials. You can use, you know, sort of uh IAM or SSO or your favorite way to log into AWS. Uh, from there you'll log in and you'll get into our console. Uh, you'll see it looks a lot like the ADOS console because we're using the same cloudscape, uh, open sourced, uh, UI components, uh, but it is, you know, it's a separate URL. It's, it's different. Uh, once you log in, um, and as you're doing the account creation process, we're gonna use a new feature that launched last week as well. It's called, uh, IAM temporary delegation. This allows the, the LEO network to ask for permissions into your account. So in this example what we're doing is we're asking for, uh, requests to put a cloud watch metrics in as well as event bridge events and some support, uh, functions for our customer support. And so you do this one time. If for example you don't have access to create IEM roles you can also delegate that to like your IEM administrator so it's a cool feature uh we're using that to. Essentially increase the amount of metrics and event bridge that you'll get. From there, uh, you can go through the ordering process. Um, there's a few different components to this, right? So, uh, you'll choose an antenna that's a one-time cost. Um, you can then choose, uh, what we call the service plan that's a lot like your cell phone bill, happens every month. Uh, that service plan is gonna be based upon multiple things, so you can get some, um, in certain industries and verticals. Um, you can also choose whether you want that networking to go to the Internet or do private networking. So that's one of the forks you can choose as well. And from there uh we can tell you what it cost um and what that looks like. So it's a fairly standard ordering process. You do start with your uh your location so we can make sure that we have capacity there and that we're offering service um in that way. Then, um, while that antenna is getting shipped out and you're getting ready for the installation, if you chose one of the private networking options, you can go set up your own IPV4 and addressing, uh, details. So if you're cloud people, this is kind of like the VPC for your satellite antenna things. And so, uh, from here you can set up IPB-4 subnets, cider ranges, uh, and you can associate it with a gateway. So you can associate it with a gateway for direct connect or transit gateway. Uh, and those will allow you to connect directly to AWS or to that PNI that we talked about. Once the antenna shows up, uh, the install is meant to be very simple. So, maybe put on a pole mount or a non-penetrating roof mount, however you want to install the device or the temporary stand, just put it in your parking lot, make sure it works. It will need to see the top 110 degrees of the sky or 35 degrees above the horizon. From there it's a single Ethernet cable back into an indoor power injector. It does need to be an Amazon Leo power injector just because there's some proprietary technology going on there. Uh, and then you connect that to the rest of your network, so you connect it to your switch, connect to a firewall, router, private 5G, it's Ethernet. You can do what you want and so, uh. And that's, that's all very simple to do. The, the larger ultra and and despite being a little bit larger, this one you might want like two people who are kind of getting onto a pole, um, but otherwise it's, it's very similar. So, uh, it's 110 degrees. Uh, no one's invented like. 300 watts of POE yet so uh we do have a standard power brick, um, and then that has just a standard Ethernet coupler that's designed to be uh ingress related for being outside. So same thing you'll wire up the power, the Ethernet plug it into your existing network, and, uh, you're off and should work. Then, you know, as we all know, day 2 happens and this is where we start doing management of things. So this is where your network operations teams and security teams and other folks, you know, want to make sure that these things are being managed correctly. So I've got a list of some of the sort of the metrics and events that we're starting off with things like how much data have I used, uh, the, the signal strength, uh, I wanna see the uh the angle of the antennas to make sure someone hasn't kicked it over or those kinds of things. These are available in the Leo console, uh, but since these are also being shared through the AWS temporary delegation, you can also view these metrics inside your AWS account. And so if you wanna build dashboards or automations or your uh network operations team wants to get you know a page that sounds like a duck every time that you know something happens you can use all the existing cloudWatch and EventBridge integrations um into the rest of your environment. Uh, as well, all of our logs are going into A-list cloud trail, so if you need to figure out who made that change or why something broke or whatever it is, uh, that's there as well. Uh, from a billing perspective, um, pretty standard. This is again not in ATOS console, so you won't see it in the same billing area. Uh, you will build a profile per country that you wanna operate in. Uh, you have to enter like your billing address and some other things that are country specific. Uh, the pricing is not released yet, so, uh, stay tuned. Uh, we'll have that more as we get into general availability. So, uh, I love all the folks out of ABS. There's a bunch of builders, and you guys wanna build things and see how to use it. So now you understand all the background. Let's talk about like what we're learning from customers. This is, this is my favorite part of the job, you know. I've been out here 3 years talking with folks about their use cases and what they can do, right? Um, so for starters. It's, it's pretty wide and broad, right? Leo, as a company, you know, we're working directly to sell to consumers. We also have selling directly to enterprises, and we also have a bus a sort of part of our business selling to governments, so that, that covers a ton of use cases. So you can think about almost every vertical you can think of financial services, mining, uh, you know, the. Rescue and disaster relief, manufacturing, there's interesting use cases kind of across the board, so. Let's walk through, you know, these use cases, but what's underneath these use cases and what's creating the new capabilities is, it really comes down to three things. So one is the performance. So you get a lot more bandwidth, a lot lower cost than you could do before. So what does that enable? What does that change, right? So there's some areas if you're already using some bandwidth and you just have a lot more, it's easy, but there's also areas where like it's so much more bandwidth that you can change the applications, the way you work, and just the, the. How close that site even feels to you, right? Uh, one of the pieces of feedback we get from folks is to go, we'd love to put this type of workload or this application, um, on the network, but we don't trust the other options right now, not enough. And so if you have critical infrastructure or other things that you need to go through security reviews and auditing and those kinds of things, um, that's a lot of what we're building for. And then it's just a location, you know, if you're in a hard to reach place that limits to what you can do. So if you add up these kind of three factors, let's walk through how you can use it. So let's start off with the easy stuff. Um, I've worked with enterprise long enough that no one does the hard stuff first. So we're gonna walk through easy things and things that make sense to a lot of people, so. I mean just providing Internet connectivity to folks is really powerful so if we take an industrial use case um we hear things like the guys don't wanna go out on that oil rig unless they have full confidence that they can call someone when they need to. They need to make sure they can and they wanna talk to their families and they want to just do basic things like that, not a lot of complex architecture going on, um, so we get a lot of use cases like, hey, give the folks Internet if someone's doing maintenance they wanna be able to call someone that's good at maintenance, right? Um, or they wanna use Salesforce or CRMs or whatever applications they use every day it gets pretty far. Um, also, for whether you're, uh, telco building cell towers and you're trying to get connectivity there for the first time or you're someone like, you know, our own internal Amazon folks building distribution centers, getting day one connectivity there is difficult. It can take weeks or months. Amazon can ship devices much faster than that and so you get, you get an antenna, you stand it up and you have day one connectivity, and then, yeah, day two you can choose what to do with it. You keep it there for backup or you move it to the next place that you need it. And then you think about the sort of just education and the sort of the underserved parts of the world, right? Uh, we're working with folks that go, hey, you know, we're gonna put an antenna there for maybe some industrial or business use case, but there's also, I don't know, a school there or, um, we think it's maybe in our best interest to add financial literacy or training to like the, the, the corporate uses that we're using as well and so there's a lot of things of just like Internet to schools and and countries that need it. So this is all just kind of easy things low risk as we get maybe a little bit further down we we can look at the architecture, right? So this is. You know, it goes to the gateway. We taught you those things. And yeah, maybe using Cloudfront for your gaming update or you're using a corporate application, a data center, or maybe your learning application happens to be on AWS and one of the interesting things that we talked about was, you know, AWS doesn't take those things off the backbone. So, um, it's basically like cold potato routing where it stays on that network the whole way. So if you're using applications that are on AWS and you're just doing the Internet, it doesn't leave the network. And so you get benefits of this even without doing anything fancy. If we get a little bit fancier, um, the next thing we see is backup and resilience, right? So we've talked a lot about the, the, the backhoe and again cell towers are also not immune from these things. So if those go down, uh, you want another option maybe, um, or to support microwave networks um and industrial use cases we see things like, you know, hey, we're out in the middle of nowhere and we, we're trying to get everything we tried every cell carrier, we've tried every satellite provider, we've tried every fiber provider and man. You just can't keep this site up enough and so uh go to space uh we have a different network, we have a lot of different ways that that we work and so this non-terrestrial network is a great way to add resiliency to applications that are need to stay up all the time. In typical enterprise use cases, we see a ton of work with SD-WAN. You have multiple options, and Amazon Leo can just be another one of those that plugs into that. Um, then also the use cases around like disaster response, so we're working with folks that go, hey, we need to bring in a whole team of folks. They need to access medical records or they need to do, uh, maybe like voice over LTE and communications, uh, when they stand up, um, after some sort of event happens. And so they bring maybe um some sort of case that's like pre-built in and it's got multiple options and now Amazon Leo is part of your kind of your go bag that you take out to these types of events. Uh, from here this architecture is also fairly simple, right? So you can take your SD-WAN router, which already takes multiple forms of connectivity into it, and just add Amazon Leo to it so that you can run the SD-WAN either in ADS, which a lot of folks do, um, you can also run it at your data center, and so, uh, works pretty simply. Some folks we're working with want to do and, and add private networking into this. So essentially you can add your Leo path to be fully private so that can connect directly back to your data center via that that PNI or you can take it directly into your VPC and connect your SD-WAN there. So in this case, some of the benefits are um you may not actually need an SD-WAN router if all you need is that encryption and you need privacy. The, the antenna can do that. Alternatively, some people want to further secure their SD-WAN, so now you can run SD-WAN over private addressing, and that's one less thing that's exposed to the internet. Then we get a little bit kind of higher up. Let's do some harder things. So this is, you know, in the industrial cases this comes down to a lot of things like OT and, uh, critical operations. Um, these things you don't want usually connected to the Internet, uh, and so what does that look like? We actually have a couple of slides on this. I'll walk through here in a little bit. Uh, one of the cases we see with telcos is they want to get rid of older 2G 3G networks. So you can take those control planes, you can put them on AWS, you can run that network there. And now your transmission from your cell site and then back into your virtualized 2G 3G core uh is all running on, on one network again. And so, uh, kind of an interesting use case. Uh, we see a lot of use cases, particularly since, you know, we work with AWS a lot about data center resiliency. Those things need to be up all the time. Uh, how do we add Leo to this to make sure that we add more nines to your reliability story. Um, and then also if you think about remote healthcare, one of the examples we heard was, hey, look, in this country there's not enough radiologists, like radiologists are not distributed equally across the world, and so they wanna find out, you know, hey, can we, can we do this virtually? Can we, can we use radiologists from other countries, put an antenna at this hard to reach place, and now they have good enough connectivity they can talk to doctors and healthcare experts in other places so you can change medical outcomes through connectivity. So if we take a look at a couple of these examples, these start to get a little bit more meaty, right? So this is an example of, um, we call it the turbofan demo that we're running on our, uh, briefing center, and this is a sort of a physical manifestation of the full Purdue model, right? So we've got full IT OT separation that's going into a cloud WAN network. And so the idea is most of the time for these types of workloads you run those locally and you try to do that as best as you can. In some cases that local site may go down. You've got sort of a site resiliency quantity of 1. So if you start to change this scata network and you start putting some of the components in the cloud, 1, now you can start using that scata data in the cloud for interesting data lakes and analysis and other things, but 2, you can start distributing that across the world. And so this model is have a backup for for all your your skated traffic, keep it separated and move it to the cloud if you need to. But now that you've got resources that are running your local site remotely, you need to make sure you get to the cloud extremely reliably and so here you use whatever connections you can and you add Leo as your resilient backup and so we can connect directly into your private network uh and it all again has some integration there. If we take a look at another example, so this is the kind of gold standard for direct connect, right? So if you want 4 9s of SLA offered from Direct Connect, this is what you gotta do, right? So 2 ports at 2 locations each. Uh, when I see customers do this, uh, usually like large mature customers get there and they can do this, um, but you're kind of looking at like a couple $100,000 usually just depending upon routers and project managers and cross connect costs and, and everything else, so not everyone gets there. So this is the 3 9s version of that. It's a little bit easier to get to but still can be challenging for folks, particularly as you're just getting started and so, uh, one of the, the things we're working with customers on is. If, if you're trying to do a migration, you're trying to get into ADS. And your your end goal is getting to the right inside that VPC we can do this faster, right? Again, we can ship an antenna faster than project managers can figure out where a cable goes and so, uh, you can use this for day one connectivity. Your application team, your developers are happy because they can get to that VPC where they need to send their traffic. And then you continue to do the work and you add the direct connect location so that port shows up great. And so now if that, I don't know if that router has maintenance so that goes down, you've got a backup path through through Leo. And this continues to work, you know, even as you add more resiliency. So if you get to the 3 9s or the 4 9s architecture, then you still have an additional, you're adding more resiliency to that, uh, through Leo. And so then we get into I I call this just transformation because typically if you think about people processing things, this is where you start changing the people and the processes, right? And so, you know. We're still on enterprise preview and so it's still early days, uh, but these are some of the use cases we're hearing from customers where they get, they think there's a big change to start changing what they're doing right if you take a look at. Excuse me, if you take a look at some of these industries, right, uh, manufacturing, uh, energy, uh, agriculture, they've been doing this for sometimes centuries out in the middle of nowhere with no connectivity. So the amount of like people running around with like pencils and doing it in a very reliable way, it exists and you go, OK, well what if we give you gigabit? What would you do with that? And they're like, well. We, it would take us a long time to figure that out, but it seems like we can do a lot of things. And so if you take a look at like automation, right, so if you take maybe manufacturing, if there's a certain part of the manufacturing floor that's dedicated to running a local data center. If you have good enough connectivity and if you can move that data center outside of that facility or you just take the non real time stuff out. You get floor space back, but now you can start running more interesting applications that maybe require more computing or or tied into central systems so this can be things like, you know, uh process automation or um. There's a lot of very interesting things like for example like Amazon does to do in our manufacturing and and the way that we do logistics. But it takes time to get there, it takes connectivity. There's also then this question of like where do you put the computing? So if, if you have strong connectivity to the outside world, do you need a local data center? Like we've talked with customers that go we have a data center here just because that fiber to this area isn't very reliable, maybe it's an island or something else, so we had to put a local data center there. If now you have strong connectivity, you can go, OK, well I can use that connectivity. Maybe to put an outpost there so I can put an outpost there. I can run the local computing and it has enough link back to the cloud it can work, but you might go, if I have good enough connectivity, let's just run that stuff on the cloud. I don't want to run the computing there. So we're having conversations like that with customers, uh. Also, uh, machine learning. I've not said the word AI yet, uh, so sometimes people are pleased about, uh, but we do see some very interesting cases where the data and the operations and things you're doing in rote locations are. Valuable So we'll talk about that one a little more detail here, uh, but then also like if you think about in-flight entertainment and things that move, um, what can we do now, especially if we add cloud applications to it. So This this example is is interesting. I've got a chance to to go out on site with a handful of customers to really deeply learn about their use cases and one of the consistent things we see is that there's always someone there that deeply, deeply understands like how everything works. There's a, there's a guy that can put his hand on the motor and say if the bearings are going bad. There's, you know, a guy that knows how the, the fish swim. And if like they swim like this they're hungry. If they're fish like this they're gonna breed. Uh there's a guy that can tell you that uh when the the the valve pump makes this sound like it's because someone's abusing the system, um, there's all these like and sometimes all they want is a camera or if they want a microphone or they want an infrared heat sensor, right? So if they just go, I just, I just want the microphone. If I can get the microphone, I can send all that data to the cloud, we could do this stuff. So the idea is like you're not taking this person away, but if you can. Send this data you can get this data off of just being maybe it's not even being monitored at all, uh, you can start sending that through machine learning systems you can start to do this stuff at scale, right? And so you're not talking about huge amounts of bandwidth sometimes but you are talking about now let's change the way that we're operating at that site which again they may have been doing for a while. Uh, and then you get into sort of the mobility use cases, so, uh. We, we, for example, we have an announcement we made with JetBlue, right? So how do we change their passenger experience, but also like, you know, what's important is no one likes to pay a lot of money for flights. So how do you increase the efficiency of these things? How do you track the, the internals of the airplanes, right? Uh, if you take a look at like maybe land mobility, if you look at something like mining. You would really like for these big expensive trucks that can cause safety issues to be maybe automated so you don't have folks driving those things. But then how do you get there, right? You need monitoring, you need video, you need multiple layers of connectivity to make sure this is going to be safe, and then once you get there, it's a lot more productive. Uh, and also, uh, I found out that people run data centers on boats. I personally wouldn't want to run a data center on top of salt water, um, but there's people that needed computing and things out in the ocean, right? So, but there's also, that's also where a lot of things can happen. So how do you get your IOT data and your logistics data and all of that out, uh, and so there's a lot of interesting things that we're gonna be working on here, um. And then also one of the companies we're working with with with Hun Energy, right, so uh. If you take a look, some of a lot of the people we work with right now are, uh, utility providers. You talk about a business that's been around for a long time and and have a low appetite for risk. Um, it's, it's, it's those folks and so, uh, they're a good use case, uh, because we're working on use cases like this. So we go, how would we change the way that we're doing power distribution, uh, locally and even across the world, right? Uh, it's something that's extremely regulated, um. And so if we want to do all this cool stuff on the right with AWS, we want to make sure we can do that reliably and simply. So this looks sort of like the turbofan demo that we looked at where we can do HMI, we can do separation, we can put the firewalls in, we can pipe that in over into AWB. We have separate VPCs for operations and analytics, uh, that's going into StageMaker and S3 for analysis and then all your third parties that need to operate these, these things can operate in different accounts through Transit gateway and we get that scale here, right? So, um, there's folks that really wanna change. Again, that that change it's really hard to do that we're working with. And so yeah that's that's what we've got. So you know to wrap this up, um, one, thanks for coming out. 2, I think you know if if I have anything to share with you is that there's a lot of ways to use this, um, hopefully we've shown you some examples. You're all now satellite experts, so you can tell your friends, uh, and so there's a lot of use cases that you can do you, you can start simply. You don't have to go into the hard stuff first, but we can also talk about that if you want to, right? So there's, there's this path of continuum you can go through. Uh, we're an enterprise preview, so you can go and sign up for the interest list. Um, we also have a booth, uh, downstairs if you're go down to the Venetian by the bus, we have a booth there you can come talk to our teams, um, sign up for the interest list, those kinds of things, um, and yeah, thank, thank you for coming out, and, uh, I'll be up here for questions. I'll also, uh, provide feedback. I read all that stuff, so if you wanna see some more weird stuff in the next presentation, just let me know.
