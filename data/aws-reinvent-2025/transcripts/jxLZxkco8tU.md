summary: "This session, \"UCLA’s AI Assistant: Reimagining Student Success with Kyndryl & AWS (AIM349),\" hosted by Kyndryl's Anita Micas, discusses how AI is transforming public sector operations and the education student experience. The session details Kyndryl's \"Agentic AI Framework,\" which consists of data ingestion (structured/unstructured), an agent builder (for automating tasks), and an agent catalog (for reusable models). A significant portion is a fireside chat with Howard Miller (CIO of UCLA Anderson School of Management) and Chin Vo (Kyndryl), focusing on UCLA's implementation of an AI-driven student roadmap application. This internal app aggregates disparate student data (courses, career goals, clubs) to provide a prescriptive path for students aspiring to specific careers (e.g., \"Product Manager at LinkedIn\"). Key lessons from UCLA's journey include the importance of cross-functional teams, \"failing fast\" rather than over-architecting, and rigorously adhering to data privacy/security standards. The talk emphasizes that we are moving into an era of \"Agentic AI\" where systems can proactively collaborate to deliver business outcomes."

All right, good morning. I think it's still morning. I appreciate everyone joining. Welcome to AWS Reinvent. Uh, my name is Anita Micas, and I run the government and education market for Kindle in the US. Um, wanna welcome you here. Thank you for joining our session. We will be talking about AI native enterprise today. We've got a pretty cool lineup. In terms of format, first I'll be talking about how AI and Kindle are partnering to help the public sector experience and then we'll weave into a fireside chat with a couple of special guests to talk more about how AI is helping the student experience. So I wanted to start with a quick poll hopefully you guys can hear me. uh, first question, how many people are articulate and fully understand the difference between generative AI and agentic AI? OK good all right and how many people are using AI today to solve their business problems? Or maybe personal problems. All right, good. So my hope is that by the end of this session you've learned a little bit more about AI and specifically how we can leverage and how you can leverage AI to solve some of your business challenges. So as we look at the public sector today and especially in the state and local government space, there is a huge disparity between what the public expects and the services that are offered by public agencies. Over 50%, actually 53% of citizens say that they are frustrated with accessing public systems. And I think about my own experiences. I can on Sunday night order my groceries on my laptop with the click of a button. I can get a ride to here with an Uber or Lyft app within a minute, but I think about, oh my gosh, I gotta figure out the status of my state taxes. I don't know where to start. I gotta go get my transcripts from 201992 when I graduated. That's, that's gonna take a whole day for me to do so. It's really just a huge disparity between what people are used to receiving in the private sector versus the public sector, and that's really something that we all need to work on. In parallel there is an 80% use of funds by the state and local government entities on maintenance and operations. That means old systems. That means we're not talking about moving the needle forward. We're not talking about modernization. We're not talking about transformation. We are literally spending a majority of. Our taxpayer dollars to maintain legacy systems and what this means over time is increased cost. It means that you have less resources that are able to staff the functions to maintain your legacy systems and eventually you may end up having security issues and exposures. So this is where we intersect between the challenge and the opportunity. How do we leverage AI in our core operations to help us to reduce support costs, to increase stability, to help security, and ultimately deliver a better experience for citizens and for students in universities. I wanted to share a couple of examples of um areas that Kindle has worked to leverage AI and to create some pretty nice outcomes. Uh, first one is in Stockton, California. Kindle helped deliver the city's first public facing AI predictive dashboards which provides 320,000 residents real-time insights into road safety and estimated repair times. In a large Midwest city in the US, we've modernized the parking and citation management systems with an AWS AI powered omni-channel contact center. Try to say that a few times, reducing wait times for up to 20%. So this means how much time people stay on the phone or wait for information or updates to understand how they can continue with their day in citation management. And at UCLA, which we'll dig into deeper during our fireside chat, we have worked on digitizing over 2 million paper records and laying the foundation for AI driven student services. So at the core of all of these examples where we have leveraged AI to improve the experience is Kindle's AI framework. When we talk about AI and native AI specifically, we're talking about baking AI into the core of operations, not as a project, not as a pilot, but embedded in every single thing that we do. The Kindle Agenic AI framework. Sorry, the Kinder Agenic AI framework includes 3 main components. The first one is ingestion of data. It enables the capture of structured and unstructured data from diverse sources. So think about source code to help us with understanding what are. Dependencies, what are the relationships with your source code? Think about security and IT policies. When we create agents, making sure that they're within the realm of what we consider to be the safe standards. Think about policy and procedure guides. How do your operations run? What do we do? What are the opportunities? What are the bottlenecks? The second is the agent builder, and this deploys intelligent agents for specific business functions. The agents can automate tasks, make decisions, and ultimately adapt based on context. The third component is the agent catalog, and this is where the magic happens. It's a centralized repository of reusable AI agents that enable us to scale by deploying repeatable models across the organizations. Together these elements help us to go to and evolve and evolve into a proactive AI native operating model. So I wanna share with you a short video, which I guess I'm gonna be doing too. Around how Kendall has helped with. AI In a client setting. All right, it's not working. Oh, it was? OK, hold on. Play Enter? No, it's. I, OK, sorry, sorry, sorry. Mr. I'm in tech. I'm an IT expert disrupted by the likes of Uber and Lyft and faces existential crisis. The crux of the issue with these legacy rentals are their rigid pricing engines, which are hard to change. This has resulted in declining revenue year over year and major operational efficiency challenges. We are partnering with a major rental customer to fundamentally reimagine their pricing engine using agentic AI. The Kindle Agentic ingestion tool analyses dependencies, extracts embedded business rules, and creates a modernization roadmap. This step transforms static legacy logic into structured human readable format. We use the outputs from ingestion to automatically generate comprehensive tests and modern code. The outcome is a flexible microservices based architecture that supports modular components like fleet, customer, pricing, and ERP integrations, all designed to work independently but seamlessly together. The result, Is a cloud native API first environment that accelerates innovation, simplifies integration, and gives us the agility to evolve with business needs. Finally, we are evolving the pricing functionality to a dynamic system. This involves 3 distinct agents. The first agent ingests multiple external sources, such as weather insights and flight patterns to come up with probabilistic pricing. The second agent runs Monte Carlo simulations to understand the implications of various pricing scenarios on revenue and fleet utilization, and the third agent performs compliance checks based on state and federal guidelines. This modernization program is set to deliver a state of the art, dynamic pricing, just like ride sharing platforms, where prices adjust in real time based on demand, availability and external factors. OK, um, hopefully that helped to drive home the Kindle Agentic AI framework a little bit more in terms of how it works in action. So I'd like to shift gears a little bit now and invite two incredible leaders to the stage for a fireside chat, uh, as mentioned earlier. Kendall has partnered with UCLA Anderson School of Management to reimagine the student experience. I'm excited to invite Howard Miller, the CIO for UCLA Anderson School of Management, to share more about this transformation and how it's helping students at UCLA. And I would also like to invite Kindle Kindrs Chin Vo, Vice President of Innovation at Scale for the US. All right, well, welcome, folks. Thank you. Thank you. OK, so Howard, I'm gonna start with you. Cool as a pioneer of AI both as a as a person and as a CIO and also UCLA being a pioneer of AI, what, what are the things that inspired you or compelled you to start you on your native AI journey? Well, I mean this is a long story and we only have a certain amount of time, so I'll, I'll try and keep it relatively brief. I think it starts with a conversation with my dean almost 3 years ago. We're at that 3 year mark when chat GPT first became something that we all knew and and heard about, and he said to me, Howard, he said, I put my final into chat GPT and it got a B+. You know, what's our value premise here in higher education and you know it's not as draconian as it seemed at that time and over that course of the next 12 months, what we did at UCLA Anderson is. Uh, we decided that we wanted to be an AI thought leader as a school. We formed an AI task force which was cross-functional between faculty, staff, and students. This was September of 2023. We started to ideate on things that we thought might make sense for us as a business. We got to the end of December 2023. We found a platform that we liked. We found a cost that made sense for us. We pitched it to the dean and I said, is this something that the school wants to go forward with? He said yes, so 2 months later we were working with some consultants. We had a platform and then 2 months later, ultimately we had our 1st 2 production use cases. So it's kind of a labor of love. It's not something that you get to overnight. I think I'd highlight the importance of having a cross-functional group of people to get together and help you set that direction. I would encourage you if you haven't started already, and I saw by the show of hands that many have, but for those who haven't, it's not too late. I think it's OK to fail fast. I think you want to find things that are quick time to value, so don't try to boil the ocean and try and find things that really have meaning for your business. So AI is a great technology. It's the most transformative technology I've seen in 35+ years working in IT, but at the end of the day you still have to marry back to business outcomes. Yes, so I think this is a great example of how AI can help um educational institutions and as we start to see some funding cuts potentially this is a great, great method. So next question Howard is um challenges. What sort of challenges did you face and then specifically how did you overcome them? Sure, so, um, you know, truth be told there are always gonna be challenges along the way, um, specifically with the work that we did with Kindle in the app that we built. Uh, one of the biggest challenges is this is one where we decided to attack student data and so I already told you about the things that are quick time to value and if you want to go to sensitive and confidential data, don't start there. But with the work that we did with Kindra, we decided that we wanted to attack student data. I'll get more into the app that we built in a little bit. But to do so there were a ton of hurdles in addition to just institutional organizational change management, so in other words, convincing somebody at the center of campus that we could go ahead and do this and follow third party risk management. We wanted to ensure the security and privacy of that student data, so we took extra care to architect that environment such that it mirrored the information security policy of the UC system almost line for line so if it was ever going to get audited that it would pass that test. So there were definitely challenges around the data security, the data privacy. Calling together all of the data that we put into this application, uh, we took from a lot of different disparate systems we took from the students record database we took from our career placement we took from our clubs, we took from our course catalog so calling all of that together to put that into one application in one environment and one engine, um, definitely there was some labor of love that was associated. Uh, with that, and then just lastly at the end having a user interface and being able to approach it with something that a student might ultimately want to use and that was the compelling part of this application to begin with, right? At a two year graduate school of management, our students come in very quickly they're not there for very long. We inundate them from the beginning. They start in the summer before classes even start in the fall. We send them a ton of email. They're starting to interview for internships. They're doing their coursework. Some of them still don't really know what they want to be when they grow up. And so on top of all of this, we just say good luck, right? And there are career advisors. There, there are things to help them along the way. But the application we built was really meant to be a roadmap. So if you came in and you said you wanted to be a product manager at LinkedIn or you wanted to work here, we could give you some kind of prescriptive path to say if this is what you wanna do. You should take these courses. You should look at these companies for internships. You should join these clubs, and ultimately these companies are the light companies that follow that road map to where you ultimately want to go to be successful. So all of that was part and parcel of the challenges along the way. So one thing we've talked about um is the rate and pace of technology and how fast it's moving. We started this project with you, I think it was December 2023. We finished around August of 2024. So one of the things that I think about a lot is what, what would you do differently or how would you approach this project differently now versus when we started and embarked upon it a couple of years ago. Sure, I think I would have, as I said earlier, I think I would have failed faster to begin with. I think we spent so much time trying to get the architecture right that by the time we launched, the technology had changed so much that not putting something out there sooner and getting it into people's hands and going back and reiterating on that was probably the biggest mistake we made. Yep, got it. OK, Chin, over to you. So from your van. Vantage point leading agentic AI for Kindle US. How do you see organizations approaching AI? Are customers ready to become AI native? Or what trends are you seeing? And I know you're just 3 or 4 months into Kindle, so welcome. Appreciate you. 3 or 4 months into Kindle, but I've been in this for, for quite a while there, um, so actually a lot of the trends that I'm seeing is, is sort of reflected in Howard's story there. So especially in, in education, uh, institutions and government agencies there. You know, the, the promise of sort of the value coming out from the, the generative of AI, when, when chat GDP came out, you know, that's sort of just the, the, uh, the reactive way of actually engaging with it to the progressions to agents acting independently to multi-agent systems to the argentic workflows we have today, you know, in each step there, the value is there, and I think that the excitement in each of the, uh, in each of these, these, um, you know, sectors are, are is there and it's palatable and. To how it's part actually my, uh, my oldest daughter, she's in the, she's, uh, a junior this year, but last year even as a undergrad degree, she's in a field where it was emerging. It was, uh, an arts program combined with data science, machine learning, and computer science. So they're trying to really do that creative aspect to things. But with that, the university was just building this program on the fly. Now imagine having someone going through that planning or course load and things like that as the things are changing at the same time. I can tell with personal experience it was hard and a lot, a lot of work there. Now if we actually had a system like how we're describing just for that purpose there, it would have saved both her experience and even the faculty's experience actually doing this there, right? So the value is there. So what's stopping all this here? And I, I think the 22 main points it was really highlighted one is data, the other one is trust, uh, on that side of things there. So on the data side, uh, where Howard started his journey, I think from a technology perspective there, there's a lot of solutions out there how we can actually speed up that process both from. You know, cleansing the data to access the data data in place as opposed to moving into one location there that, that can really, uh, uh, hit your timeline there. The second aspect of it is trust itself. First of all, all the, the, the, uh, the policies, audit trails, and, uh, you know, the things that Howard described, it's not just in education, it's the same thing in government agencies and things that we have to do there. Then having the idea of, of an autonomous agent just interact with this data, it scares a lot, a lot, a lot of corporations and our customers there. And so I think the trend that we're seeing now as we're moving through that is actually services, uh, that's, that's gonna actually address those issues if you just noticed that like recent announcement from AWS for all the agent core services there, um, from making sure that the agents have the are accessing the right tools, uh, on the policy engines there and making sure the agents are doing what they're supposed to be doing, and then observability aspect to it, right, in terms of making sure that, uh, how we're saying. Do we actually know what agents doing at all times? Can we actually, uh, see that that audit trail around that? So I think the, the change is the foundation to, to that. It's, uh, it's supporting that. It's allowing us to, to to get to that trust, uh, aspect of things. And then lastly, just wrapping all around there is all the soft stuff around it. Any, any transformation we see, you got, you have people side of things. How do we actually work with the, the, the, uh, the, the, uh, the consumers of this and also the providers of this? Their, their process is gonna change and we gotta figure out how that works. And then, then also the um uh the uh the uh the the business process optimization uh piece of it there so there's a lot of things that that comes into play there. Yeah, so, um, I think my next question is probably applicable to both of you, so please feel free to weigh in, but, um, when we do any sort of large transformation project, bringing our people with us is so important. You talked about trust. Um, I think Chin, from your perspective I'd like to hear what do you think is so important about OCM organizational change management when you're doing a significant AI transformation in your organization. Yeah, I think if, uh, I break down actually my job role, you can see that my, my, my, uh, my role is innovation at scale which is a little uh ambiguous there what it actually is, um, it actually encompass some major functions to help, uh, our customers adopt AI and it's actually the data and AI practice which is that say for self is required. Our tech, our, um, enterprise strategy, technology, the architecture side of things. People in performance, that's the OCM performance side of things there and then the vital, which is the user experience side of things. If you think about what you just described there, we need all of it to actually, uh, do this successfully, and that OCM or change manner piece is still central and core to it. So all that is actually under my umbrella because we have to work together actually to make sure that adoption is successful. Thank you. OK, question for both of you. So how are, we'll start with you. How do you see the landscape of AI changing as we move forward? What are the things that you'll do? How, how I'll go back to the landscape in a second. Chen said something that made me reflect on the answer to the question that you asked. And when we started this project, the ability to get at data. Was somewhat of an issue, right? So you said we had to take all of that data that we had and we put it in one place and to the question of where AI is going now we wouldn't have to do that, right? The ability to integrate into so many different things with AI is one of the. Bigger changes maybe in the last 6 to 9 months that would have certainly made my, you know, journey with this application a little different, so I wanted to highlight that because I think it does speak to how quickly things are changing and how it's difficult for us in the seats in which we're in to sort of predict what's next, right? And so you've talked about your agentic AI framework. I'm looking at tools that do low code AI with agent builders, no code AI, which is just drag and drop. I think we're all trying to figure out what agentic AI can mean for us organizationally. Again, for UCLA Anderson, it's sort of this fail fast approach. I have a couple of things that are agentic. I'm not gonna say they're the. Sexy what everybody thinks agentic AI should be at this point. I have an agent that can call another agent, and it can successfully do that handoff such that the person who's going from agent one to agent 2 can then go into agent two and do specifically what they want so it all doesn't have to be done under one hood. And the reason for that approach again is building blocks, foundational. Again, if you try to architect something so large at the beginning, you stand that chance to fail by putting those building blocks together. In a very measured way as part of that journey is sort of how we're approaching it and how we're going to get there next. I think we're going to be in this agentic AI phase myself for at least the next 9 to 12 months. I know 2025 was supposed to be the year of agentic AI. 2026 will probably still be a year of agentic AI, but I think the ability to have agents that call other agents that actually can deliver on business outcomes without. Scaring away the humans who think their jobs are going to be replaced is ultimately sort of where we want to head next. OK, thank you. And then Chen, same for you. Where do you see the future of AI for enterprises going in the next 12 to 18 months? Yeah, I think it's, it's going to build on, I think we're going to get to a point where the discussion of agents as part of an enterprise is not going to be a question anymore. It's just a, it's going to be a reality that we're going to have to account for and plan for there. And, and I think all the, the, the patterns and trends and architectural approach is gonna help support that's gonna be driving that. I actually look back at how we, we, we look at compute services. If you remember, went from virtualizations to containerizations to serverless at this point in time there, I think no one is questioning the fact that we can run enterprise critical systems on AWS in any of those, those of the compute services, which was not the case when we were first starting, and I'm seeing the same trend in the AI AI side of things with the architecture support of, of that, uh, that piece there. And I think the uh the framework that we have like our our Kindlegenic framework, it's a very lightweight framework and it to addresses Howard's point, it's meant we're not heavily investing any particular tech stack side of things. We know 3 months from now, 6 months or 12 months, it's gonna change. Something's gonna come up. We're gonna have to make sure that it can adapt properly and pick that up, uh, really in in an efficient manner, and I think that's where we're gonna go. It's, it's the, these sort of lightweight frameworks where we can adapt, change, and actually just pick up the latest trends as it comes along. Great well I wanna thank you both for sharing your comments and your perspectives. I think a few things that are really important is, you know, the, the criticality of the data, making sure that we have clean data and then it's used in the way that it is intended to. Um, understanding outcomes. AWS always talks about working backwards. I think we're all here trying to solve business problems, and we have to look at what is the business problem we're trying to solve and then work backwards. Um, I think involving people, both of you mentioned having to bring your people with you to make sure that when you go through this transformation they understand the what, the why, and what role they play. Um, Howard, you mentioned iterating, right? Fail fast. How do you make sure that whatever you're building at the end of it isn't not what you expected? So really just making sure that we iterate, and then I think both of you talked about trust, really making sure that there's trust as you build these new systems. So as we wrap up our session, I can't change the screen. Sorry, let me go do that. Um, I wanna thank you all for joining, um. And I wanna make sure and I hope that each of you from this session learned a little bit more about AI and more importantly how you can leverage AI whether it's agentic or generative in helping to solve your business problems. If you're interested in learning more about how Kindle can help you, you can visit booth 1475 or you can register for an agentic AI workshop using the QR code. So I wish everyone a wonderful rest of your day and enjoy AWS reinvent and thank you for taking time with us today.
