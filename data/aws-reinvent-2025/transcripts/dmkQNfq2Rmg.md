Uh, so, good afternoon, uh, and welcome everyone. Thank you for coming. I know it's end of Thursday and it's kind of hard. So, uh, I appreciate you taking the time and coming, talking with us. So, uh, today, uh, we will take an opportunity to talk through, uh, AWS Secrets Manager's extension of its current capabilities from. Natively managing and rotating AWS secrets to now do something very similar for non-AWS secrets or third party secrets, which has always been a challenge. My name is Ritesh Desai, as it says, and I'm here joined with Raj Phajay from Fannie Mae, and Raj is going to take an opportunity to talk through Fannie Mae's use case and how this specific delivery or manage external secrets benefits them. Uh, By the way, I will have to share Raj and Fannie Mae have been partners and customers of talking with us over multiple years, providing us with timely and valuable feedback which has eventually led with a lot of launches, enhancing overall customer, uh, security posture. So thank you. Um, next slide. All right, so, um, obviously as is tradition with Amazon, we start with customer problem and then I'm gonna talk a little bit about how we thought about the approach to the solution and then eventually how we got to what we launched, manage external secrets and of course followed up, uh, you don't have to take AWS's word for it. Uh, there'll be a customer, Fannie Mae talk about how this has helped them, uh, and continues to benefit them in the future so. Um, we will end, I will take on after that and talk a little bit about, uh, the high-level workflow, and then do a couple of minute demo and I'll talk through what exactly is happening in that demo. All right. So, customer problem, uh, third-party secrets. There are a bunch of customers that store third party secrets like, let's call it Salesforce, API keys and other such that you sometimes, it's really hard to set up a regular rotation for this. You have to build lambda functions and then each third party has separate lambda functions. There is an inherent risk of rotation of availability risk. What if it rotates in CR manager but does not rotate at the at the source, and so there's a downtime risk. There's the continued cost of keeping all of those lambda functions up to date security wise and things like that. So we started to think about. The problem in a way that we've thought about AWS Secrets. Secrets Manager today integrates with all AWS services that use custom or use a customer secret, right, and we natively integrate with them and rotate them. So for example, if a customer creates an RDS instance, they can simply do a check box and it will automatically store the secret in Secrets Manager and set it up for rotation. So then we started thinking about it and we said, well, why can't we do that for non-AWS secrets, right? Why can't, and then after that, after months of working with customers and partners, we eventually came up with a strategy of building this what we launched, uh, manage external secrets. So this was launched, uh, last week. We are going out today in the spirit of being incremental in nature. We'll have 3 partners that we are actively integrated with. Of course, Fannie Mae has been the pilot customer, giving us feedback along the way, and we, we have eventually launched it, uh, last week. So this is, um, kind of my time to like say, OK, let's talk and learn from Fannie Mae and see what and how their use cases are being solved by this. Uh, thank you, Rush. Uh, my name is Raj Partajay. Uh, I'll be talking a few things in terms of the customer pain points, the, what are the, the outcomes we are looking out of this particular, uh, capability point of view, and by using this solution, what result we are able to achieve. So with that, let me give you a little overview about Fannie Mae. So the Fannie Mae is a chartered organization by the US Congress in 1938. Fannie Mae provides reliable source of affordable mortgage credit to borrowers and renters in the United States. So with that, let's go over some of the pain points of what we have observed in our environment. So when it comes to the, the third party secret manager, by the way, we have been using the AWS Secret Manager since its inception. We were partnered with the AWS to build the services, uh, uh, which is helpful for all of us. Uh, how many of you are really facing this pain points of managing the secrets? How many of you are using it? Yeah, it's, it's a, it's a, it's really, if you look into the diagram over there, you know, if you have to manage the custom, you know, the, the third party secrets, you have to write a custom function to manage, rotate that secret. Now you have to schedule that one. You have to do the observability around that one. All these things becomes a custom development, so it increases the complexity. Managing, maintaining of this custom solution is going to require your additional resource capacity. Inefficient manual processes involved. For example, how are you going to rotate the one if you are not writing that lambda function or something to rotate the secret if you are doing manually? Think about that manual complexity of what it's going to bring the risk to your business processes, what's going to happen if your secret rotation fails or it is not timely updated. So that the risk is, you know, the, the, the interruption to your business is going to be very high if you do the manual processes and disappropriate effort, what you need to spend on managing these secrets, so. Added, you know, the overhead of multiple third party integration. Think about it. It's not just one ISV or one third party SAS what you're going to integrate. Most likely in this cloud world we have to integrate with many of them. So what that means, several custom things you need to manage, maintain that one. These are all the pin points. Not only that one, when there are version changes, you have to change that one as well. So with that one, let's look into what is our desired capabilities, what we are looking, what we are looking at when when this particular pain points we observed. We want to enable the centralized uh onboarding and managing of these credentials. Why it is important. By doing so, we should be able to give the self-service capability to our application teams so that way they could manage that credential. Ensure that there is a reliable and secure way of getting the secret from the secret manager or the the you know for the application to consume the secret which capability is already available, so leverage that capabilities, support the seamless credential rotation so that way, you know, minimize the business interruption as part of this rotation cycle which allows the the and the additional important feature what you need to look into that one is. The secret needs to be replicated to the multi-regions because your application is, if it is running in a multi-region, you don't want the secret to be consumed from one region to another region, so the secret replication is a key desired capability and provide a Complete compliance and governance for the secret rotation capabilities. So these are all the desired capabilities what we put forth with the product team and with these new features when we integrated the following results what we have observed. Operational efficiency. So this allows us to streamline the secret onboarding, secret management. End of the day, the manual processes, whatever I'm talking is no longer really required. It may be required to initiate the things in some cases, but the end of the day, the secret is auto managed. So that that goes into the automated compliance so you get the inbuilt ability to auto rotate the secret based on the policies. So you just define the policy. What is the good part of this one if you do the manual this one or. Manually on board the secret, the person who is on board the secret still has the knowledge of the secret. There is a risk associated with that knowledge, right? You don't want the people to have the secret. You want the system to have the secret. So this gives you the automated compliance for that one. Next comes to the centralized visibility from the which delivers the unified oversight into the secret management for you. Because now it is not just your internal secret what you are going to manage through this one service, it's also providing your external secrets, third party secrets. And then when it comes to the security, think about that one, the scenario what you are talking about now. The human is out of the loop from the knowledge of the secret point of view. It is a system to system, so from this highly improves your security posture and reduces the manual handling. End of the day, from your operational efficiency point of view, from the security point of view, you get the secret is managed well and secured well, as well as reduces your potential business outages because one of the important things here what we worked with the team to provide the solution is make sure that when the secret is rotated, the application doesn't break. We should be able to rotate the secret without breaking the applications. So that's the, the, the, the final, the, the end of the result what we achieved by using this new product. With that, I'll pass on to uh uh Ritesh to give the closing mark. Yeah, so, uh, thank you, by the way. So I, I think it is a really good uh. Insight into what customers' use case concerns are, problem, specifically from a point of view of Fannie Mae like a customer, but I honestly speaking, 80% or 90% of these are very similar to other customers and so our. of working with uh anime was take all of the learning and kind of apply it so it helps other customers as well and we have seen great, um, you know, feedback about this feature so I'll do a quick high level walk through. So there are certain aspects of, uh, this mental model of. Natively integrating with third parties that is slightly different than what we would do with AWS secrets. So in AWS service I know enough about AWS services that I know what type of secret it expects. And so in this case there is a little bit of initial configuration to ensure that a specific partner has a specific predefined format once that is. The rest of the workflow, if you have used Secrets Manager in the past, is exactly the same, right? All the great benefits that you get out of Secrets Manager continue to remain the same. That includes the envelope encryption through KMS, the integration with Security hub, the integration with cloud formation, the integration with config, all of that exactly remains the same. And in addition to, I think what Raj mentioned, the compliance part. Everything is audit trail or audited in cloud trail, right, so everything is monitored. It's similar to what you would see in any AWS service. Any mutation action, any action on the AWS service will be tracked there. And so. Nothing changes. So I think the intent of the slide was to say there is this slight difference about how you put the secret into the system, but after that everything just flows. So this kind of gives you perspective or this view gives you a perspective of. Retrieval. So there's, as you can see, a customer application, and it is interacting with Secrets Manager the same way, similar to like you could use the CLI, CDK, SDK. You can use the latest launch Secrets Manager agent to retrieve the secret. All of the functionalities remain the same. Behind the scenes, what is happening is the rotation code that was approved and validated by Secrets AWS and the partner is now incorporated into the rotation schedule. So this is not a lambda function. This is just a code that we run as we assume the role of the. Customer and run it on the ISPs side so it will first update following the same process that we do today. First update the secret in the resource which is at the ISP site. Ensure that it's working and then update it in secrets manager. So talking to a point of, hey, application downtime, the risks to that. We are shifting the responsibility over to AWS, so we're saying we will make sure that the applications do not go down in, in this kind of scenario. So I think that is a key aspect of it, and there are 3 points written over here and. The 2, the last 2 are extremely important. So the biggest problem with rotation of people wanting to rotate or not has always been, oh, I have to do a lot of work to rotate, right? So this ensures zero overhead in terms of rotation and gives you a complete managed rotation experience. The partnership trust uh ecosystem we believe AWS has a really solid framework of ensuring the partners that come into our system are well validated and insured so we, we continue to do that. So when you look at it from that angle, we are saying this is a part of ecosystem that is well trusted and you continue to use it, uh, to leverage Sequence manager rotation. So that's where we are at. So once um. In the next slide, I'm gonna walk through a demo. It's a recorded demo, so I'll try to talk through it. I didn't want to use audio here. Uh, and so it'll have my, my voiceover. So I'm supposed to click this button. I'll try it. All right, so this demo is obviously of the console, as you can see, there is already an admin secret created there. Now you go into the system where if you're not looked at it, there is now a new system called manage external secrets, and you'll see the three partners that are in there. So for example, now we select Salesforce and remember I talked to you about the predefined format and metadata that you have to store. So this is where you would set that up. So. As you can see it it it's slow, but it'll go through. It'll essentially all of these items like consumer key, secret, base CRI, all of them are already identified as the metadata in predefined format. So once that gets set up. You go to the normal screen, of course, the naming structures that your company or your organization, um, ensures that your customers follow or your teams follow, sorry, uh, we'll go through that and then if you notice something here, the rotation is automatically. Default enabled. So there's, it's usually in a normal secret. We do not automatically enable it, but it's already enabled and that admin secret that was created I showed you earlier is the one that is used to rotate the secret. So, um, so now, of course, the secret has been created. If you're not looked at the console, you have to go down and save it and then finally it'll come up, uh, and so. One of the key things that I wanted to show in this demo was if you look at the versions here, so versions are Secrets Manager keeps hundreds of versions of the secret behind the scene, but, um, if you look at the version here, um, you will notice, notice the number E01 at the end. Um, it is now marked as AWS current, which is if you do get secret value, it is going to return that secret or that value, sorry. In the initial setup, this type of setup, secret is set up for automated rotation. So, and it'll rotate immediately after the secret has been created. So right now what the person is doing in the demo is refreshing it so it starts to rotate. So, you see now the E01 is still current, but the new one has been created and now switched. To current. So it's already rotated and so even if for example a customer is still handling the manual part of the secret and copy pasting it, it is rotated immediately after creation, which means the new secret is not now available. I mean no one knows about it, like it's less human visibility. So that's kind of the view of it. And so that's where I'm ending. These are um. Uh, some of the QR codes my team asked me to add. Um, there's, if you are a customer, Uh, that is looking for, for a partner integration and, and the three that you see do not fit the bill, please, uh, let us know. Talk to your SA, talk to your team. We'll make sure those are prioritized. And of course there are tech dogs launched as well. So thank you again for joining.
