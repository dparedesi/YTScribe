Welcome. Uh, I'm Mike Hedgey. I am in my 5th year at AWS. Uh, I like to say that I do Epic stuff at Amazon. Uh, that's mainly because I came out of retirement after spending about 30 years at Epic. I was Epic's technical fellow, so what does a technical fellow do? Well, we looked at new technology. for Epic's core system to make it easier to implement, easier to operate, and easier to scale. Now in the past 4 reinvents we've really focused on Uh, running Epic on AWS, we've, we've heard from Tufts Medicine sharing their story on how they implemented Epic, uh, directly onto AWS. They were the very first organization to run production Epic on AWS. We heard from Geisinger Health in a three-part series where they talked about their decision. Their execution and the results they they received migrating Epic and non-Epic applications, what we call integrated applications, uh, onto AWS from on-premises and that brings us to, uh, today's bold claim. This time around, I think I, I, I, I want to put this out there. Running Epic on AWS. Has become standard practice, or at least it's becoming standard practice. And I've, uh, I'd like to be able to substantiate that claim for you, uh, and I'm gonna substantiate in terms of adoption. Benefits and results. Then we're gonna pivot to what we're gonna be talking about today going beyond the EHR. So when I started with AWS in 2021, the epic on AWS community. contain 2 health systems, only 2. Tufts medicine, which was known as Wellforce back then. And Central East Hospital cluster out of Ontario, Canada. If we fast forward to today, there are 46 organizations in the EPIon AWS community. Folks from the United States, Canada, Australia, all live or implementing Epic on AWS. And when I talked to a, a healthcare exec about why, and uh he, he framed it very, very well, I thought. He said it comes down to with these tight margins that health systems have to operate in. It's important to look beyond just benefits to IT. And he said there needs to be a focus on 3 benefits, and you guys deliver on that. He said the business benefit, the technology benefit, and the financial benefit. And I'll just step through what he had mentioned to me and the important thing is these don't all have to be in balance like this triangle, they just have to be in harmony with each other. If we look at the business benefit, we're talking about agility, we're talking about experience, and we're talking about security primarily from the agility standpoint, uh, being able to, to ensure that infrastructure isn't getting in the way of innovating for the populations that you care for. That infrastructure isn't getting in the way of speed of mergers and acquisitions of divestitures. It isn't getting in the way of leaning in with EPIC's Community Connect, where you're offering EPIC to health systems that you have a clinical relationship with that can't necessarily get EPIC directly from themselves. And the experience side of things, making sure we're demanding so much of our physicians, our nurses in terms of documentation, making sure that they get a delightful experience running Epic, and then from a security standpoint, we're getting health systems are getting inundated with ransomware tax and having an Epic isolated recovery environment running on AWS gives us confidence that we can still continue to deliver. Informed patient care. Even if ransomware has taken her on-premises systems offline. We take a look at the technology side of things, it comes down to scale, resilience, and performance. We talk about scale, what we're talking about here in Epic terms is something called global references per second or GRFs. That's how EPIC measures how much work is being run on their database. And Epic sizes their workload on AWS larger than any other cloud provider, and it's been that way since they first started sizing on AWS in 2021. It was 8 million global references per second or GREFs. In 2023, it grew to 42 million, and today, 2025, we're at 140 million GEFs. Now if you think about that, that's about an 80% year over year growth compared to a normal health system that grows on average 20% year over year. It's important to stay ahead of, of your growth. From a resilience standpoint over that same time period. AWS has the best resilience record. And it's more than just service resilience, it's also about application resilience. The Eicon AWS architecture that we collaborated with Apion is spread across 2 regions and 3 availability zones in each region. That's like spreading risk across at least 6 data centers. And then performance, making sure that you get consistent, excellent response times and the way that you do that is first use fast technology that Epic approves. Second, Use the newest fast technology. And then 3rd, making sure that you are replacing your, your epic stamps with the latest technology to make sure that you get consistent, excellent response times. That also helps to drive down some costs. It keeps the response time good and keeps your clinicians happy. Which brings us to the financial side of things. And, uh, Jeff Bezos once said that there are, there are two types of companies. Those that work towards price increases and those who work towards charging less, we will be the 2nd. If we take a look at the 116 as of July of this year, 116. Reductions in AWS service prices. Many of you probably know that, uh, but the focus on trying to save you money is something core to our culture. And we've seen organizations improve their operating margins. We've also seen organizations take some of that savings and start investing it into some innovative practices. So we, we've got those three benefits and the results really speak for themselves. If we take a look at the class research that's done with health systems, uh, where they survey respondents on their experience with a vendor. AWS received the highest marks, and this led class to award AWS with the best in class for public cloud in 2025. So what does all this mean? It means that uh well this is what I used to support the claim that uh that Epic on AWS is becoming uh or has become um a standard. What we wanna do now this time around, we've talked about moving Epic to AWS in the past uh reinvents, but today I wanna look at, uh, uh, what, what are, what are folks doing to improve their operating. Outcomes beyond the HR. What are folks doing to improve their clinical outcomes beyond the AHR? What are folks, uh, what AWS services are folks using to that include EHR data, uh, that really help improve care delivery. And so to answer those questions we're going to hear two stories from two organizations, two speakers, two transformations. We are going to hear from Jupiter Medical and their experience with Amazon Connect, and we're going to hear from Ray Children's Health and their experience building a modern data platform, and then we're going to sit down and have a little fireside chat with them as we dive a little bit deeper. But let me introduce our, our first speaker. Uh, this is one of the pioneers of EPIC's Community Connect program, uh, one of the first organizations to implement where they, they share their EPIC environment with, uh, smaller health systems, and now it's pretty much standard in all Epic health systems. Uh, today he is the chief information officer of Jupiter Medical Center in Florida and please welcome to the stage, Kevin Olson. Thanks mate. The Godfather, grandfather of community connect, that's kind of nice. All right, we'll go with that for today. Thanks. Uh, again, Mike, uh, I introduced myself. I'm Kevin Olson, uh, Jupiter Medical Center CIO. I've been there for about 5.5 years, and for those that don't know about Jupiter Medical Center, we are in Palm Beach County, South Florida, just north of Miami, Fort Lauderdale, tucked up on the Treasure Coast of Florida, uh, very attractive place to live. People come there from the north during the winter to kind of play, uh, uh, warm weather instead of cold up in the north. So we're going through that experience right now. So. It's a great market. Uh, we've done some really cool things over the last couple of years, including our migration from, uh, or to, to Epic on AWS. So, uh. So I can get the pointer to go here. There we go. So a little bit about Jupiter Medical Center. So very proud in terms of our independence. We're the only independent healthcare system in the area. We've got tenants, we've got HCA, Cleveland Clinic, everybody's around because it's an attractive market. Um, with that said, we're also very proud of our, our score in terms of leapfrog A, CMS 5 stars, which really measure clinical outcomes, which is what we're all striving for. Um, but that said. We all face these cost increases. Mike kind of referred to it a minute ago, labor costs, supply costs, everything else going up. But then our reimbursement remaining relatively flat, maybe 2 to 3% in Medicare, but then the private payers follow suit and they're kind of in that same ballpark. So it's a very challenging time in terms of margins and healthcare, and there's no really, you know. Light in sight in terms of this big pot of money sitting at the end of a rainbow, so we've all got to kind of roll up our sleeves and kind of figure out how to run more efficiently, effectively, etc. So for us, our journey was really to get away from this fragmented system we had. We're very proud of our outcomes in terms of clinical care, but the systems and platforms that we're utilizing and running did not reflect that. So we had very fragmented experiences for our, our providers, for for our patients. So if you had a. Clinical visit in the hospital, you'd have to go to one portal. If you had a clinical visit in an ambulatory setting like your provider, you had to go to another. And if you had to pay your bill, you had to go to get a third. So our goal was really to create one unified experience for our patients and our providers, so. In 2022 we decided to take the journey, make the leap, and go to Epic, having gone through a few of these in the past, it was a pretty good, good, good little journey for us with the overarching goal of having one experience for our, for our patients, which was absolutely crucial because it's a differentiator again competitive market, those costs increasing, reimbursement staying flat. At best, so again, that was kind of our overarching goal is to really kind of make that experience a meaningful one for our patients world class, as we say in in our delivery of care. So that went well. We went live, but along the way we recognized, hey, there's some additive technologies and benefits that we can take advantage of, one of which was Connect, not Community Connect, AWS Connect. And so we reached out to our partner at the time, our, our, our rep, and said, hey Rich, you know we can do something different. We have got this really very old legacy platform. It's costing us 3/4 of a million dollars a year. We have a 9% abandonment rate because of folks just not getting the service that they're looking for. The analytics didn't exist. We had to sift through manual reports. Same time we've got these very expensive diagnostic imaging modalities, CT, MRI, that are really not being utilized to their fullest. We're like we're like 75% utilization as far as our imaging modalities, and patients are frustrated. They may get an appointment two weeks out instead of in a couple, you know, 24 to 36 hours. So that, those are a couple of big, big deals. And again, the cost of running such a platform, a little bit extravagant in terms of cost. So we had every intention of making a change there. So again, we reached out to our rep and we decided to put that in the scope of our epic migration. Fast forward to 2024 Labor Day of 2024, we went live and we saw that radiology backlog really decrease, so 60% reduction in, in utilization of, you know, schedules, capacity utilization of those very expensive modalities again, CT MRI, 20% improvement. That's significant, so much so that we've got another CT that we'll be installing here in the next probably 3 months, I believe is the target date. Our abandonment, our abandonment rate in terms of calls reduced by 50%. We're at about 4% now, and then again, the operating expense significantly reduced as well. So really, really good positive outcome. So the next piece of this is where do we go next? So as we continue our journey in terms of, you know, patient engagement, patient satisfaction, creating that world-class experience. There's other additive benefits that we found along the way. Mike mentioned IRE. We've got the marketplace to buy underlying technology, but really think about what is next in terms of, of AI enablement, experience enablement for the patient. We're really looking at some at-home functions where I'm at home, I need to get to a clinic, what's the closest one? What's the best one? How do I get there fast? What's the directions? Can I integrate that with MyChart somehow to kind of do the navigation and get information into into the portal. So that's something that we're we're looking heavily at currently as we speak. There's a lot of other things outside of the patient experience space in terms of technology, but that is a huge, huge one for us that we're looking at because again, the competitive landscape. It's not getting any, any less competitive. UHS has a hospital they're building. I can almost see it from my office, not quite. It's a little bit of an exaggeration, but it's close. And so, you know, it's getting tighter and tighter, and we wanna remain our inde keep our independence intact, uh, because we're wildly, um, emphatic about keeping intact and profitable. So that's a big deal for us. So that patient experience, clinical outcomes 1 and 2, if you will. So more to come as things develop. One thing, kind of key takeaway as we look at the technology underlying technology, and we hear this in the press and we hear it all over the place, well, AI is gonna displace folks. Healthcare is a very human. Experience, right? Take care of our bodies and it takes a lot to kind of get through traverse the system. It's, it's difficult talking to insurance companies going from one care setting to another, whether it's off site, off campus, onto a main campus. It's, it's difficult. So our intention is really to make that as seamless as humanly possible for every patient that we serve in our community. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Mike. Thank you, Kevin. I'm looking forward to have a seat over here. OK, thanks. Look forward to diving a little deeper in the fire sat chat. Um, I'd like to introduce our second speaker. Uh, she's a, uh, was a literal rock star. In a previous, uh, uh, iteration of her, her career, uh, Rockstar meaning Rockstar Games, you know, Grand Theft Auto, she has taken her experience and, uh, brought that into, to healthcare now, and she's the director of integration and analytics at Rady Children's Health, Caroline Peca. Thank you so much. Let's do it. So I started at Radi Children's Health two years ago, and the first question I asked was, where's the data? And the answer I got was everywhere. Some data was hosted by third parties like CERN or our legacy Data Platform. Some data was on SQL servers that were managed by IT in some basement basement room. We all know those rooms. And most of the data was in dashboards, emails, laptops, and people's minds. Our data was like a 1000 puzzle pieces spread across different tables, every piece being beautiful on its own, but we didn't have the full picture of a child's healthcare at any point. Every click, every email, every login, every data extract cost us time. And in pediatrics, seconds matter. When a clinician has to wait for data to load, the patient has to wait for their care to move forward, and that's what we are fixing. So we started building the digital nervous system at Redi Children's Health. It's a living, learning ecosystem where data flows freely and securely from bedside to boardroom to the research lab, where insights are available as fast as our patients grow. That's the transformation we started. The first thing we built, I'm sorry. was our new data platform, Platform Mosaic. It's a cloud native platform built on AWS and powered by Data bricks, Tableau Cloud, and GitHub Enterprise. It's governed, it's scalable, and it's ready for AI. Data bricks is the engine beneath the hood. That's where our data experts prepare, transform, model data at scale. Within one One single workspace, so everybody's collaborating. It's also the the space where we have our ask the data functionalities. That's when a non-technical person can ask questions in plain English and explore a data set. Imagine that. It's democratizing data science responsibly and securely. Tableau Cloud is our uh facets of our mosaic platform. It's where clinicians, analysts, and operational leaders can um access visual stories and these dashboards instead of having outdated extracts have access to fresh data. It's also uh where they can all collaborate, share, develop new dashboards, and also publish them within the guardrails of our data governance. Elation is our brain trust. That's where we document all our KPIs, catalog all our data, and where tribal knowledge is finally available and certified. There's also the functionality to ask in plain English questions like where can I find asthma cases by zip code and get an answer in plain English, uh, where you get the data steward, the data set, and the business KPIs that you are probably going to be wanting. Finally we have AWS and AWS has all these tools Athena, Glue, Sage Maker, and it's the playground for our research and innovation. Our researchers are able to experiment, analyze, develop models at scale. All of this is collaborative with uh cross functional and. And other institutions, but at the same time they can do this within hours and minutes rather than waiting for infrastructure infrastructure to happen with IT. That's gonna be long. um, so this data platform, it's where governance meets empowerment. All these tools enable creators to innovate, researchers to develop faster, and users to have access to insights faster. But our journey to the cloud is not just about technology, it's about partnership and AWS was our partner in moving from a concept to the reality. They actually co-invested in our modernization efforts, making us innovate faster. We had an AWS architect within our sprints um who was helping us develop our architecture. Making sure that we could always track the cost of whatever we were going to build and building an infrastructure and an architecture that was really secure and HIPAA compliant. And then finally AWS helped us design this environment that's HIPAA compliant and secure, making sure we can um uh encrypt everything that had uh role-based access and also that everything was embedded. So when our data engineers had to create new pipelines, this took hours instead of months. Then there's our RCH chat. It's our private generative AI assistant that we've built in the same AWS ecosystem. It's on cloud 3.5 and has rag models which are retrieval augmented models. They don't guess the answer. They actually go within our internal knowledge base and get the information from our policies, operational documents, etc. So when somebody asks, you know, what's the reimbursement, uh, policy for education. The RCH chat gets the answer from the appropriate approved policy. Or when somebody asks like what are the social media do's and don'ts again it goes retrieves and reference back to the security and compliance policy. It saves people time that's for sure um I mean they can leverage this chat with sensitive information and feel secure that the data stays in our ecosystem there's no hallucinations and every private chat is logged uh and HIPAA compliant. So it's really, you know, a dream for everybody. I got some feedback. Somebody said it's like having somebody 24/7. Available to help me and and that doesn't judge me with all my silly questions so that's the kind of adoption we can only you know like dream about right it's amazing. So now we're in front of the next wave. Yeah, I know more, um, so it's the merger between Children's Hospital of DOC CHC, who hired me two years ago, and Radis, a Children's Hospital of San Diego. And also because we like to do this to each other, we're going to Epic. So within this merger, it's an opportunity to really reimagine everything, right? We'll be able to ask ourselves what applications truly serve patient care, what applications need to evolve, and what applications should go to the cloud. And we wanna be cloud cloud smart we don't wanna be cloud everything. AWS taught us that infrastructure is strategy, so we wanna make sure we place things where they're the best, whether it's being secure, cost efficient, or just more efficient in general, right? So we'll use that lens as we, you know, take both systems from both organizations and create this connected ecosystem, um, as we merge and then Epic, I mean with the native interoperability and the fast data updates, it's the perfect anchor for our platform Mosaic AI and advanced analytics capabilities. This is where our data strategy merges with the clinical strategy. So what would the future look like? Imagine a researcher wanting to develop an early stage diagnostic model for congenital diseases, and he goes to our platform Mosaic. The data is curated, so ready to go. There's all these amazing tools for them to build the model, and they build something within what, minutes, maybe hours. What about the clinicians, uh, that need to know what's the readmission rates in these clinics in next, uh, for the last 3 months they go to the RCH chat, they ask us questions within seconds they have a trusted answer. And finally imagine the supply chain manager that gets proactive alerts when the stock is low and then they can make a timely decisions. That's what we're doing that's the digital nervous system we have built. So what's next? There's 5 facets. The first one is application modernization, which is, you know, looking at everything that we have as organizations and making sure we're making the correct choices with regards to cloud fitness and just applications in general. The second one is our data fabric. We wanna make sure that what we've built for CHOC is going to integrate with what we have at Radi Children's Hospital and create this world of data science and AI. There's sustainability. We wanna make sure we optimize our costs, our, uh, operations, our storage, everything that has to do with the cloud. There's AI enablement, so we wanna add some rag models and agentic uh uh opportunity to our, uh, RCH chat. And then finally there's community we've started to build this vibrant data community where people learn and grow together and that's really, really important for us to continue building it, making sure it thrives. So I know it's, it's a lot, um, you know, the merger, hey hi, the cloud, um, I mean, cha change, change is scary, but for us at Radis we've decided to, you know, go above and beyond our fear, right, because fear is just curiosity in disguise it's the feeling that you get just before you learn something amazing so we decided to try. To fail fast and to learn faster. And we built with our partners and we built with trust. Our journey was not about technology at the end it was about courage, the courage to move from comfort to clarity and to believe that empathy and innovation can go hand in hand. Because every time we push a byte in the cloud or we publish a dashboard or we create a chat, a chat prompt in our RCH chat, um, what we're really, really doing is getting better care faster to the children, and that's what technology should do. It should amplify care and the future at Radis thanks to our partners, our colleagues, and. And also our uh our team members, um, is now so here we are. Thank you, Michael. Thank you both for your presentations. I'm looking forward to diving a little deeper with you. Uh, Kevin, I'll start with you. Um, I love that, uh, metaphor that you shared about, uh, being able to see that construction happening. Um. How does the immediate competitive pressures really shape your technology decisions? You know, Carolyn kind of alluded to in her presentation about change. You know, I think some folks are locked tight that they don't wanna change, and I think you've gotta look around and kind of look at the landscape of the competition. What do they have in terms of I've talked about the patient experience a little bit today and what, what do they have and try to investigate how do you make it better, you know, and I just think it's crucial and, uh, you know, San Diego is competitive as well. I know that, but you know, South Florida where I'm at is very competitive and so keeping that create those creative juices flowing. Ready to embrace the the technology that can make, make change in a positive way for the organization is crucial and um we'll keep doing that as we go forward for sure. Yeah, wonderful, uh, Carolyn, uh, keep on the, uh, the theme of transformation here. Uh, you've led some significant change in Children's health and more to come, more to come. Uh, what skills and organizational changes were crucial to execute this transformation, really? How did you build and develop your team? Oh my God, I think the number one was communication and collaboration. Um, I think, um, from my experience in. Uh, in arriving in a healthcare and definitely in my organization there was a lot of silo. There were, there was a lot of silo of work being done by my team or other teams, but also a lot of surprises like here you go, this, this new thing, right. So what we're really focused on was really getting our stakeholders whether it's physicians or our rev cycle people, uh, you know, started with us in the project as we started so at first they had no idea what platform Mosaic was and why they should even care, but we still tagged them along with the correct, you know, messaging for sure. We don't wanna make them completely confused, but we really. Brought them along the journey like at every single step including the the steps where they they needed to be more involved um and at the end of the day was teaching our team members to do so and to be more collaborative because at the end of the day they should be serving um our stakeholders and really understanding their business as much as possible and being, you know, their buddy. I call it the buddy system so we buddied up. How wonderful you both, uh, mentioned the human element of this here which, uh, I like to think that's a, a transform a transformation or transition into, uh, um, AI, what I like to call augmented intelligence as opposed to just artificial, uh, and so Kevin, you emphasized using AI to augment, uh, rather than replace human interaction. Uh, can you give us some specific examples? Well, certainly the connect piece, you know, that's not to displace a human, you know, but it's certainly to add efficiency to their to their to their work, their everyday work, and at the same time have data to make changes in terms of interactions with a patient, capturing information, whether it's some sentiment analysis that came through that may not be as positive as we all would like, um, but to do that in a little more close to real time. And that's, that's an enabler, you know, that's not just a displacer of people, that's just enabling more human efficiencies that's one supply chain is another one we'll be looking heavily at um we've, we have workday, you know, but we wanna look at some other things in terms of operational choices when it comes to supply chain replenishment because behind labor. The supplies in terms of expense in any health care organization it's, it's just the fact of the matter and like I said in my presentation reimbursement is, is a little bit uh 2 to 3% maybe, uh, but uh it's not getting any, any tougher or any easier and so I think the enablement of processes through AI or whatever we're gonna call it, um, is just crucial, um, and I think the successful organizations are gonna embrace it. And not take this kind of fear, you know, tactic, uh, or stance, uh, going forward. So, uh, it's an interesting time for sure. I've heard it characterized as, uh, expanding human capacity, you know, with the folks that you do have. Absolutely love it. Um, so, um, Carolyn, with RCA Chat, you're, you're building a, uh, similar, uh, human centric approach. Um, with all the concerns around AI hallucinations and accuracy, how did you gain clinician trust, uh, in the system, and what guardrails did you put in place? Uh, did quite a few things. The first thing is really, uh, one, relate our RCH chat to their previous experiences with, um, with any chatbot, um, if they have any. So we try to tell them it's the same as chat GPT or any other, um, you know, chat that you might be using where. There needs to be a human in the loop. You need to be looking at this critically, right? It's not different. It's the same for those who have no experience, and there are some, uh, with any chatbots. It was all about, uh, on boarding them. So we really took the time to hold their hands through sessions of what this can and cannot do. Unfortunately, you can't, like, you know, think about all the use cases they, they could be using this for, uh, but we did it in a way that was really creative and. And fun so they could start thinking about how they would use this in a way that makes sense and um and to your point they can be critical about um it's for sure like any type of rag models we definitely did a lot of validation and we have performance monitoring on our models to make sure that they don't uh drift and and such so we're very invested in that but for the chatbot itself it's all about like education and just making sure they they understand it's not like 100% accurate. OK, let's move from, uh, technology to some of the tangible impacts that, uh, you're seeing. Uh, Kevin, you mentioned some remarkable, uh, uh, results with Amazon Connect, I mean, the 50% reduction in abandoned calls, for example. What surprised you most, uh, about the operational impact within the 1st 30 days? The, the level of adoption, it didn't, you know, a little concern about, you know, change in terms of the team and so I think they, they, they embraced it. They, they took a hold of it and owned it, um, I failed to mention in my presentation, you know, the thing that kept me up at night too is like we've got a growth strategy, right? So we've got a new patient tower, we got a new surgical institute that just opened up and a new hospital we're building. So those incremental pieces like this we're talking about, if you can set aside the worry of those operational initiatives and tasks are huge. So the the the the embracement of the technology in terms of the process change for the team was was a welcome surprise in a really strong way. And Carolyn, you're democratizing access, uh, but with data. How do you balance making data accessible to non-technical users like you mentioned, that's awesome, uh, with ensuring HIPAA compliance and proper governance? That's, well, step one was governance, right? We don't give access to anybody at any stage if we don't really understand what they have access to and what they can do with it, right? So this is really a step wise exercise where we identify groups of people who can uh do things and then we enable them so we started uh originally with um discovering there's a lot of power users within the organization that were um actually new SQL new Tableau um we're doing this either um on by their own in a silo or um in. Their previous organizations, so how do we enable these people? So we built the governance for these power users on how, uh, what data they can have access to, what tools they need to have access to. We built policies, we built a community, we built, um, you know, best practices they have to follow and definitely as they publish we built this, um, this governance of the quality. So they can't publish a dashboard for uh broad use without coming to our team and going through the process we would go through as we were, uh, publishing our own, uh, data pro uh products. So that's the power users. Anybody else, whether it's with elation or Git just giving GitHub access, it's all about education and, uh, and the use cases and. Building that relationship so they come to us when they have new use cases or they actually tell other people to come to us because they have use cases so we really wanna make sure that the, uh, you know, people who wanna do things feel welcomed to come and see my team instead of the traditional, uh, IT. I don't want this. I, I don't think that's really beneficial for any organization. I love that, uh, as we look to the future. Uh, 33% capacity coming, is that what you're, you were, you were saying? What's next on your innovation roadmap? You shared a little bit of that, but I was wondering if you could maybe dive a little deeper. Yeah, you know, I mentioned the supply chain earlier, but I think, uh, regularly I get different partners will reach out. So I spoke to a partner last week about some technologies that they're utilizing to enhance the robotics, right? So. I won't name the name of the vendor, but it's probably in your healthcare it's probably in your institutions, but, um, working with those partners to kind of help our surgeons in terms of how to provide more efficient care, timely care, and the sooner you're discharged, the happier the patient is, right? So, um, with the low morbidity rates and all those kind of things that we're measuring on a regular basis, those are, those are exciting things and so that's. That's one that's that's keen interest to our to our team for sure. Uh cool. Carol, looking forward, um, how are you approaching the integration of traditional data sources with, uh, newer sources like genomics, social determinants of health, and. IOT devices, yeah, so the platform mosaic we've built is really with the vision of, you know, we wanna be modular. Things are gonna change, um, for genomics, for instance, you know, what's the best way to house the genomics data or use the genomics data. So we have that use case currently where we're evaluating our partners, evaluating capabilities, evaluating our use cases of today, but also the future. So for every new use case we think about what's the best out there or what's the almost best out there and then let's take a look and see whether or not we need to modify our data platform or uh or use what we have already and um and build the guard rails for that so it's all about like trying right? like making sure that we have those moments. With new vendors that um are wanna showcase how great they are with uh genomics or or images for instance and understanding what they do versus what other partners do and you know where where we stand with regards to that so we built a platform that's modular that's future proof basically and uh we can always build on it and change you know we're I mean that's important like we're not locked in if that makes sense sure does. So, um, before we close, Uh, I wanna ask you both, uh, for a little bit of practical advice. Kevin, I'll start with you. For those considering a similar journey to yours, what would you do differently if starting today? Um, for us, well. You know, you showed us that early in the, the, the introduction about those that have moved Epic to AWS or went direct with their implementation. We were talking about this earlier, so just do it. I mean, there, the, the, the, the fear of failure, you know, in this space, I think has been quite a bit diminished, you know, probably couldn't say that five years ago, a little bit earlier in terms of adoption, but just doing it and then kind of recognizing that the additive features that are there on the platform that we've taken advantage of just in a small scale, we, I think we're just scratching the surface on what we can do. Um, but the starting point is just do it, just get it stood up and see what's there and, and, and. Jump on and go for the ride. I mean, that's kind of where my mind goes answering that question. I feel like putting on a pair of Nikes or something. Yeah, yeah. Uh, Carolyn, what's your advice? Um, what's, what's the most important piece of advice you'd give healthcare, uh, technology leaders in the audience? What should they look to do, say, Monday morning? I mean probably a culture change, right? So I'm, I, I, I, I, I feel like there's definitely a lot of. You know, thinking about risk, right, everything's risky and it's, it just, just freezes everybody, um, and coming into health care, that was the first thing I observed. Everybody's like, nope, we could do this because all of these things. I think it's a change of culture of like why should we do this and what's the benefits and moving from there we can address the risks. The risks shouldn't be like the first thing we think about. It's what's the benefit and then and then you tackle the risks. And if at the end of the day all these risks make no sense, then they make no sense, but it shouldn't, you know, it shouldn't. Stop us to be creative and research and think about new things, uh, because at the end of the day the world is like going fast besides us and we're just looking at it pass by and at some point it's gonna be like a really huge change if, uh, if we don't start today with changing how we, uh, look at things, look at curiosity, look at, you know. Trying things out, um, and I think for me what I instilled in my team was like the Friday, you know, figure out day kind of vibe where you, uh, on Fridays you pick a topic you wanna be curious about and you try it out and you have to come back to the team with your findings of what did you try out and what, what was the outcome, right? That's a big culture change in, in, in healthcare in my opinion from being there just two years, um, to, to, to really change from negative to positive. Yeah, I think we've, we've heard the term, especially outside the industry of failing fast, and that's, that's scary in healthcare because failure could affect patient lives. But I think there's this, this, this concept of of uh one way doors, two-way doors right in your decision making process. Definitely want to take your time on the one-way doors where you can't go back, but there's so many different two-way door opportunities out there to just try, just do it as you, as you imagine. So I, uh, we'll, we'll close on that, um, folks, you may have some questions that you wanna ask Caroline and, and Kevin. What we're gonna do though is we're gonna meet over on that far wall afterwards we can take the microphones off and get ready for the, the next session up there. Uh, and, uh, if we wanna carry the conversation out in the hallway, we, we can, uh, both of you, thank you so much for, uh, sharing your insights, sharing your stories, your experience. It was, uh, wonderful to, to listen to. I've learned some things and, uh, uh, thank you. Hopefully you've, uh, you've learned a couple of things too, and, uh, with that, uh, we will, um, we will adjourn and questions we'll meet at the, at the far side over there at the end. OK, and please fill out the session forms on the app. Thank you.
