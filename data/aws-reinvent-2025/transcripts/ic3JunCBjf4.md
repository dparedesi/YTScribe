summary: "This session, \"RAG vs MCP: Making the right choice for enterprises (DEV342),\" compares two critical architectures for generative AI: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The speaker explains that RAG is primarily for \"read-only\" retrieval of enterprise data to ground LLM responses and reduce hallucination (ideal for document search, policy Q&A). MCP, on the other hand, is a standard for unifying integration between AI agents and systems, serving as \"tools\" to take actions, orchestrate workflows, and automate tasks (ideal for system integration, API orchestration). The session provides a \"decision framework\" for architects: use RAG for knowledge retrieval, MCP for isolated actions/automation, and a \"hybrid architecture\" when intelligent workloads require both business context (from RAG) and the ability to execute actions (via MCP). A significant portion of the talk focuses on cost analysis, showing that while MCP can be more expensive due to tool execution and token usage, a hybrid approach with smart routing, prompt caching, and batch operations can optimize costs while maximizing capabilities."

Hey hello guys. thank you so much for being here. It's really nice seeing everyone watching this, uh, important topic. We just talk a little bit about RAG and MCP and bring a, a vision a little bit more about business and architecture, what is the right choice, right? So, uh, before we start, just, uh, who here has been using rag nowadays? OK, an MCP? Yeah, fifty-fifty, I'd say, yeah, but nowadays MCP is more popular, right? But you need to address some situations, uh, and understand how can you make like the best choice, uh, for your architecture or for a customer. So we're gonna talk a little bit of, uh, why, why it's matter, right? Uh, the definition like really simple about raging and speed. We're gonna talk. About your choices, uh, the tools that you have on AAWS to run MCP and RAG or how to design architecture, and we will do a comparisons like side by side, and the most important is the idea is bring a decision framework that can help you, OK, in your company. So why, why it matters, uh, nowadays data is the base for all the, the AI stuff, all the generache AI, and it, it is accelerating and evolving rapidly, uh, and more and more people are using RA, and nowadays MCP is so popular and people are using a lot of MCP, so we need to understand exactly what you need to use. That's a key, uh, choice when you design architecture to your customer or inside your company, and you need to know exactly what you're gonna use. It involves a couple of risks like uh complexity, cost, and security, especially, OK? And again, the goal here is to bring a decision framework uh for you. So what choice do you have? Rag and MCP. Rag is a retrieve augmented framework. It's mostly used to enhance your LLLMs and work with your enterprise data. So you have. Uh, knowledge base you have, uh, specific documents. You have your databases and it, and if you would like that the LLM work just with that data, uh, you can use, you can reduce hallucinations in this case, and you can keep answers aligned with your, uh, specific scenario in, in your company. Usually it's better for it's search for Q&A knowledge base, so MCP. Is the model context protocol. It's basically to standardize all the communications between agents, right? It creates a, a, a pattern like the HTTPS, uh, like the old data, all the communication protocol. So it's usually. It's more used for the LLMs as a tools. They need to take actions. They need to execute some actions. You can also read data, but it's usually for uh other uh auditors, OK. And it usually it's better for automation, for system integrations and tools that are to, to connect with your, with your agents. One options we have on AWS. So here is just uh stack is just an example. It's not an architecture. You have more tools than that that you can use. It really depends on on scenario that, that, that we'd like to design or the problem that we're trying to solve. But if you have a couple of tools on AWS that you can use to design your rackar texture and you have a couple of tools that you can design your MCP or use your MCPs, uh, server, uh, again. You can use one or another, you're not, you don't need to use all of this. Uh, we can go and see some, some examples here. So here is a really basic example about rag. All architectures that I'm showing here, they are available on AAWS as a, uh, reference architecture or on the documentation, and here you have basically a user accessing a rack application, talking to your LLM, and you have a vector database and all your documents, data, media, or whatever you need, OK? That's exactly what rack does inside your, uh, knowledge base and your information here. Here is also rack but with a little bit more complex architecture. Different scenarios here that you can use, uh, in your models or in your company. You can use open search. You can use lane chain, uh, here you can use Bedrock. So it really depends on how, uh, you design your system or how you would like to solve your problem, OK. Here's a reference architecture for AMCP. So MCP you can use Firegate, Lambda, uh, all the authentication. Now, uh, all the, the other services on AAWS that you use to support your MCPs, but it's like a basic architecture, a little bit more complex. But again, takes action and do much more stuff in this case. Here is a little bit more complex architecture, but in this case, using Agent Core, right? So here you have uh all the Agent Core runtime running your MCP services and connecting with other AWS services or external uh services here. You have memory and your other bedrock services. So we have a little understanding about architecture and we understand how RAG works and MCP works so the idea is is doing a a a comparison between them. So, uh, again, RAG is primarily for, uh, retrieval data just really only you're not taking actions, right? Uh, it's the, the content is like relatively static the the. Policies in your company, documents, uh, your risk, uh, tolerance is a, is a little bit low, and it's a quick time to valid to implement. So the complexity is not so high and you can implement it a little bit faster. Uh, MCP usually is used for your AIA agents to interact with other tools. Maybe they need to connect with other services like Salesforce or any other services to take actions, uh, and you can use MCPs, usually for, again for automations, workflows, orchest orchestration against these things, OK. Here are some common use cases that you can use with rag. You can use for document search, for example, or have a policy Q&A. Again this is all documents that you have and you would like to to access your knowledge database chat that's. Uh, each, each one of these use cases has a different architecture and you can use different services, but basically rag is recommended for this kind of services. When you talk about MCP again, you, you will see more automation, monitoring, integration with other systems, API orchestration, workflow trigger, or even the VPs automation. So, uh, MCP will give you a lot of tools and more power to your application or your LLM to talk to other systems. OK, one important, uh, thing about this comparison is exactly about cost. So I bring here just a, a, a comparison again. This can be really different depending on, on your architecture. I give an example about 10, 10,000 carries a day or 10,000 workflows day, uh, using vector here embedding, LLM interference or MCP tools. You have uh more tools or or functions and cushions here and you can see that the price really changed so that's why you need to understand especially about cost, what kind of architecture you should use. Or you should use. Even a hybrid architecture, right? So here is a decision framework that you can use when you think about what kind of uh architecture I, I would like to implement. Again, uh, Rag rag alone it's basically to provide information from your documents from your knowledge base, your database that you like to retrieve all information based on on that context, right? It's perfect for really only information MCP. Uh, it's more simple and isolated actions without a complex, uh, business context. So if you don't need a business context, you don't need your documents, you can use MCP. But now you can use the hybrid architecture. You can use both, right? Because you can have uh your business context in your rack and you can use MCP as a tool to access everything, so it's best for intelligent workloads or workloads that need to take some action or communicate with other systems. There's a couple of strategy talking about costs that you can adopt. So first, use prompt caching because you don't need to, uh, send prompts every time with or or or or spend money with tokens. Uh, you need to reduce the count of tools that you use with MCP because if you have a lot of MCPs server workings with a lot of tools inside. It will multiply your costs every time you, you execute an action. So that really needs to be really well designed in this case, uh, use bath operations. You can use a process a lot of things at the same time and you, you reduce your cost, and it's really important to implement a smart routing that you can take, make a decision between using MCP or RAG. Without using LLM before using LLM, right, it will reduce the cost. So in a simple, simple way you can just ask, do, do, do I need knowledge ground? You can use rack. Uh, do I need two orchestration or actions MCP? Do I need both hybrid and ever consider cost latency and governance in this case, right? And talking about the hybrid scenario, you can see again the comparison in costs about between between these three architectures, all right? You can see that the MCP alone consider this 10, 10,000 workflows day, it's really more expensive and here you, if you implement all the cost strategy you have a Uh, a really good scenario for the same kind of architecture. OK. Again, it really depends on, on your problem, how you, you design your system, but that's a fair comparison between these three architecture, OK. All right, some key takeaways to wrap up what, what we're talking about. Again, rack is very good for your knowledge base, uh. MCP is really popular right now because he is making all the LLMs or agents really powerful, accessing everything, but you have to care about costs, about security. It's a little bit more complex, so you need to really think about it. But now again, if you need a balance between power and complexity, you can use both, OK. And AWS provides a lot of tools as we've seen, like you can construct like building blocks and you can put both architectures together, right? So that's it. I would like you guys to connect with me. Here's all my social media, uh, LinkedIn, YouTube. I'm always posting content about AI LLMs, and, uh, you can connect with me. Thank you so much.
