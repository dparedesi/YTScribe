summary: "This session, \"Building Sovereign Cloud Environments\" (COP409), features Bo Lachange and Randy Domingo discussing how AWS helps organizations build sovereign cloud environments, particularly in response to evolving global regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, and NIST 853. The talk focuses on the concept of digital sovereignty—giving customers control over their data, including where it resides, who accesses it, and how it is secured—while still enabling them to innovate using AWS services.\n\nThe speakers introduce the \"Landing Zone Accelerator\" (LZA) on AWS, an open-source solution designed to help customers deploy complex, secure, and compliant multi-account environments. LZA leverages the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) to dynamically provision resources based on configuration provided in YAML files. This approach abstracts away the complexity of CloudFormation and allows for a modular, scalable architecture that can adapt to various regulatory frameworks. Bo highlights that LZA is particularly useful for highly regulated industries (like public sector, defense, and healthcare) as it stitches together various AWS security services (Control Tower, Security Hub, etc.) to meet strict compliance needs like data residency and exfiltration prevention.\n\nRandy dives into the technical implementation, explaining how LZA's monorepo structure is organized into packages for the accelerator core, configuration, and custom constructs. He walks through a code example of setting up AWS Security Hub across an organization, demonstrating how LZA handles the orchestration of dependencies—ensuring prerequisites like config recorders are in place before deploying rules. The session emphasizes that LZA is partition-safe, meaning it works in commercial regions as well as isolated partitions like GovCloud.\n\nThe talk concludes with a Q&A covering topics such as migrating existing environments to LZA, the need for separate LZAs in sovereign cloud partitions (as they are disconnected from commercial regions), and the future integration of AI agents to assist with configuration management. The speakers position LZA as a critical tool for enterprises that need to balance the agility of the cloud with the strict governance required by digital sovereignty."\nkeywords: Sovereign Cloud, Landing Zone Accelerator (LZA), Digital Sovereignty, AWS CDK, Compliance, NIST 853, Data Residency, Security Hub, Open Source, Infrastructure as Code\n---

Alright, uh, good morning, everybody. Um, we are here today to talk about how to build sovereign cloud environments. Um, I'll allow myself, I'll introduce myself. My name is Bo Lachange. I'm a principal engineer within, uh, Amazon Web Services. Uh, to my left here is my colleague Randy Domingo. He is a senior software delivery manager on the team, um. So today we're gonna introduce the concept of digital sovereignty and really this is a code talk we do wanna kinda talk about uh the problem statement at first in terms of what digital sovereignty is how customers are having to address this, the challenges that they see, uh, um from a global perspective, uh, goes into really what is the choice around controls that are adoptable for you as an organization and what they're doing, uh, and then we're really gonna touch upon how. AWS is kind of taking this approach and how to approach it from a sovereign cloud perspective and then how the landing zone accelerated on AWS, the, uh, solution that Randy and I, uh, manage with our team, uh, the concepts that we've taken utilizing the AWS CDK will go low level in terms of how we're, uh, addressing these challenges for large scale customers, uh, but to understand digital sovereignty again, um. Uh, it's very important to note that, uh, a lot of times customers and organizations really, uh, coming in AWS, you know, as they're bringing, uh, you know, their business into AWS, they're having to manage large swaths of data, uh, you know, and. In today's time, you know, the landscape is always evolving, uh, from a regulatory perspective, uh, at a global point, uh, we see a lot of regions like especially in Europe where, um, the regulatory compliance are changing at a very rapid pace, so customers are not just having to manage their own security standards that adhere to their business needs, but they're also having. To, uh, adhere to regulatory compliance needs as well. So from, from that perspective as you're managing your data, you need to understand, you know, from a learning perspective what controls are available to me, how do I evaluate my threat model in my environment, what controls are there, but I also need visibility into my environment as well, so. That's where customers want control over their digital assets and and how to really manage that data in the cloud. They want that control and and choice of which prescriptive controls they can use to safeguard that data from, you know, various scenarios like data exfiltration still have that technical autonomy, so they're not essentially restricting themselves from innovating in the cloud. So as we start talking about sovereign cloud, um, I, I did mention that customers are, you know, operating in various regions. Sometimes we have customers that are US based. You have other enterprise level customers that are more, uh, scalable in in the sense that they have a more global, uh, presence, and that's where it gets really interesting from an enterprise environment in terms of how we're layering, uh, controls. How we're allowing uh different segments to talk to one another, uh, and at the same time, you know, again, uh, as part of the shared responsibility model customers need to be able to control their data and have the choice of how they secure and manage that data in the cloud. So, um, from that perspective we wanna give customers. The flexibility in determining how am I layering on my preventative control layer, how am I handling, uh, my detective control to, you know, gain that audit and visibility into the uh AWS ecosystem so I can ensure that I have a strong secure security posture in the cloud. So What we've seen with customers as regulatory uh environments evolve over time, um, customers are, you know, concerned, um, you know, AWS as we, you know, give, you know, want customers to bring their business in the cloud, we constantly preach, you know, be the ability to innovate and move faster. Uh, but as we've seen Randy and I many times, customers also have to understand, uh, how can I, uh, you know, ensure that I have a strong security culture, right? And that's where customers are having to lean on, you know, can I, can my environment operate within the AWS partitions, uh, you know, where I, I may. Able to take full advantage of, you know, all the services and capabilities that AWS provides, um, or do I need to go into a more sovereign cloud perspective where I may be more restrictive and we're gonna talk about that in a little bit, um, but customers should have the ability to choose and I think that's where we kind of talk about the digital sovereignty pledge where, um, you know. The AWS landscape, you know, if you keep up with our services, we're rapidly innovating and providing more choices for our customers. Uh, for example, uh, over time, one of the big pain points for customers was, you know, VPCs and understanding, you know, within my network what did that traffic look like in terms of, you know, having a centralized. View and then recently we um enabled VPC encryption control so being able to see you know uh uh you know at a centralized view what plain text communication is going on in my environment and customers wanna be able to take control, uh, take advantage of more prescriptive controls like that and understanding where the threats are in our environment. And that's part of the pledge, the ability to continue to still evolve on our services, make them more strong for customers to operate in the sovereign cloud partitions, um, where we, you know, provide that existing capabilities and really expand, uh, upon that. So, um, that way they can continue to build, uh, regardless of the access restrictions that they can still apply to their workloads and. Again, we also talk about, you know, everybody's aware, you know, generative AI is a thing now that is a stack, a technical stack that has now been brought into the landscape and introduces from a security perspective a lot more challenges that, you know, business leaders, including CIOs need to be able to understand how can I exactly, uh, you know, still maintain that level of innovation but at the same time again, uh, provide, you know, ensure that our security posture is still strong with AWS. Um, I've delivered with, uh, a number of customers across a large number of verticals. Randy, Randy has as well across a variety of industries, uh, some very highly regulated. Um, as we start talking about, you know, platform readiness, uh, you see a lot of these AWS services here, they all play a key part. There's no one service to rule them all. Um, I can't layer on like networking controls and ensure that that's also gonna provide, you know, identity access management. The idea is here, and this is where our the landing zone accelerator solution comes into play is to kind of stitch all these elements, uh, together. Uh, and at the same time too ensuring that we are, uh, identifying and, you know, reducing security risk within our ecosystem, you know, protecting networks also, you know, at the same time safeguarding that data, preventing, you know, various scenarios like data exfiltration, uh, especially when we start working with highly regulated data, you know, if you're working in various, uh, regulatory frameworks as well, you know, that, that, that's a typical nightmare scenario that you need to always safeguard for. Um, This is a lot of compliance requirements, but again from the AWS lens, uh, I think we're up to 143 security standards and compliance certifications that AWS supports. So, uh, some of the popular ones. That you may be familiar with, uh, you know, FedRAM, GDPR, you know, HIPPAA, uh, very common. NIS 853 is widely used, uh, amongst a lot of customers as well. So, um, this is kind of a large scope ahead of what LZA, uh, the solution is trying to do in terms of, you know, deploying these, uh, scalable controls within your, uh, ecosystem, especially as you start to scale out your, uh, environment. So, this is where we're gonna start talking about the landing zone accelerator itself. Um, so I kind of, uh, you know, kept mentioning security compliance, uh, regulatory frameworks that customers are having to adhere to, and that's also, uh, just the base layer where, you know, customers still need to adopt their own security controls that don't fit within that framework to better safeguard, you know. A lot of our digital assets, uh, especially when you start working in a lot of highly regulated environments, and that's where, uh, those environments is where the LZA solution and of itself was built from, uh, where we designed it, uh, to be open source, um. This gave us more, uh, more feedback, uh, you know, from the overall community in terms of, you know, making sure that we have the most secure solution possible where, uh, we operate beyond just the normal, uh, partitions but operating GovCloud and other partitions as well again for those really highly restrictive customers that have, uh, uh, a deep security, uh, requirements, right? So, uh, the idea around the LZA is, um, you know, we wanted to provide a really balanced approach. Focusing on extensive extensibility visibility as well as modularity within the solution and you know Randy again we'll kind of touch upon that a little bit more as he starts really deep diving on the solution itself, um, but again it's a model configuration that we've seen a lot of customers use, uh, you know, within, uh, uh, um, like DOD, NATSEC, um, a lot of our, uh, public sector customers and even venturing into the private sector, uh, from a global perspective, so. We, we definitely leaned on the, uh, LZA or LZA rather, uh, leaned in heavily on the uh AWS cloud development kit as well, the AWS CDK for a lot of that dynamic provisioning that you'll kind of understand how we're, uh, utilizing that base technology. Um, so we, uh, the LDA solution, uh, is tied, uh, fairly closely with the AWS control tower. So from that perspective, when you are operating, you know, you are establishing your own landing zone and layering on your own prescriptive controls in terms of, you know, how these controls adhere to your business needs. Um, LZA with control tower is, uh, you know, something. That we, we highly recommend for, uh, all our customers to use, uh, understanding that AWS control tower, when we start talking about those sovereign cloud partitions are not available and some other regions aren't, and that's where that modularity component comes in from the LZA side so you're still able to take advantage of LZA and all the governance resources that we can provision in your environment, but. Again, as we start talking about, you know, platform readiness, um, there's a lot of design choices that come into it, you know, such as, you know, how am I layering on my preventative controls where I take advantage of organization policies like SEPs, resource control policies, how do I prevent data exfiltration. Like, hey, do I prevent, you know, uh, you know, these, these workloads that are, uh, meant to be isolated, do I prevent like VPC peering internet gateway attachments? Do I wanna make sure that my network traffic never leaves, right? And, and again, you start taking a lot of these security concepts like incident response, um. Identity access management and that's where you kind of see again how all these elements in their own security pillar uh kind of are stitched together again to maintain that security posture uh within AWS. That's also where, uh, again Randy and I, um, you know, developed the, uh, LZA universal configuration so to kind of give a, uh, level of abstraction here, uh, LZA is a solution that utilizes the CDK. It is dynamically provisioning out the, uh, your environment based on your inputs. The configuration is. Is a, you know, a prescriptive guidance where, uh, and we'll kinda go into some of the security workbooks, um, that we've developed, uh, to, um, to frame against various compliance frameworks, uh, when we initially designed this right, but, um, we essentially wanted to have a global representation of regulated customers so um. As the LZA is a globally adopted solution that we've seen in, you know, the ANZ, uh, AMEA, Namer, um, we've had to ensure that we had security compliance workbooks that map to those respective, uh, frameworks like GDPR, C5 in Germany, and this 853 is a widely adopted framework as well. And we really wanted to make sure that we had a support model that continuously iterates on this, and Randy and I will be able to provide those links for you to consume, uh, but yeah, uh, you see, uh, the universal config in and of itself is based on our well architected, uh, framework as well as security reference architecture. Uh, to ensure that, you know, again we're maintaining that strong security posture aligning those controls to those regulatory standards, um, and we've also, if you take a look at it, um, networking starts to become a thing where, you know, uh, there are various WAN patterns that are, are supported in the, uh, LZA. And uh we do have various network pro uh you know, security and network profiles based on what is your use case, right? Somebody will, uh, not every customer is the same. Other customers have various business challenges and security challenges that they have to adopt and that's where we wanted to provide options for customers where, you know, they can take still take advantage of that, uh, industry and reg regional guidance packages as well as again the, uh, extensibility layer that LZA provides when you start talking about various ISV products because again. Customers, you know, coming into the cloud may be very strong in a particular technology that they wanna lean on in the cloud, you know, as they have to come in, um, with tight deadlines, they wanna still lean on that service capability to ensure that they are maintaining that security posture within AWS. So again, uh, the LZA, um, from what we've seen with customers, uh, I, I've started in AWS back in 2016 I believe. I've been doing landing zones with, uh, customers since 2017 now. Uh, this is used to be a very long. Process and a lot of that time is once the once we got a picture of what the landing zone would look like the development phase came in, uh, and that's where LZA is really trimming that development timeline down. We're taking care of that orchestration, all the orchestration elements, uh. For you, uh, so that you don't have to, and, uh, that's why we've started seeing the global adoption of LZA in and of itself where, you know, we can lean on, um, you know, you know, a lot for like Greenfield customers, you know, leaning on those highly regulated industries and provide that multi-account structure that, you know, is really needed. Right, especially again, it's very, um, you know, just from even a small environment, you know, customers have to be mindful of their disaster recovery or business continuity planning, uh, requirements that would necessitate them operating still at a multi-regional landscape, right? And that's where you need to start having that, you know, the scalable controls in place. So I, I mentioned some of the workbooks as well. We've, um, you know, you'll find these work boats and AWS artifact as part of the universal configuration and how we've, uh, architected and designed the universal config that is up for public consumption as well. But this is just a snippet again of like NIST 853, which is widely used in terms of, you know, from an auditor perspective they'll want to see in your environment how are you handling this particular control. Whether it's at a preventative detective layer understanding how to respond to incidents, um, and that's where the LZA comes in for you and at the same time we've layered on those controls to kind of at least you know again accelerate that. Uh, ability to maintain, you know, compliance within your environment. Uh, C5 is another one that we've seen from a regulatory perspective, uh, especially out in Europe, and that's why the European sovereign cloud, uh, has come about is that their, their regulatory frameworks are changing very, very fast, and it's very, uh, difficult for customers to keep up with those changes and at, at the same time adhere to those, uh, you know, compliance, uh, regulatory requirements. So from a usability perspective, and then I'll kind of hand off to Randy to talk more about the LZA solution, um, it is open source, so as you're using the LZA solution, um, you can reference our implementation guide install in your environment wherever you want, uh, you can file feature requests, issues, anything related to the LZA solution, and our team will see it. The, the interaction with it, uh, by default and, uh, there is a lot of extensibility and, you know, feature availability for the LZA solution by way of, uh, YAML configuration files we wanted to make that, uh, user experience very seamless where you're not having to understand AWS cloud formation at a deep level. We wanna give you a YAML. Configuration that you're we're taking your inputs and we're ingesting that into the uh LZA engine which is using the CDK and then from there as we're taking your inputs we're handling that multi account multi region uh scalability for your controls so uh that's it at a high level uh Randy I'll leave it to you. Thank you. All right. So I'm actually quite excited. Uh, this is a code talk, so I get really dive into the code, um, a bit here, um, in the LZA. So I'm gonna start kind of high level down we're gonna work our way through an example of one of the, uh, configuration options that the LZA allows you to do, um, specifically we're gonna be setting up security hub, uh, through the LZA' gonna kind of go through how it's normally done, um, and some of the orchestration steps, how we configure it through LZA, and then we're gonna dive into the. The code base so the LZA like like Bo was saying is open source, um, so there's you know obviously no secrets in, in, in the magic that we're doing there, um, but one of the things that we don't get to do often is really walk through how, uh, we're utilizing the CDK to be able to go, you know, touch, uh, uh, all of the accounts and regions within within your environment here so, um, this is a pretty kind of standard set up this is, uh, the account structure. Uh, that we have within our universal configuration. So kind of a standard security OU with a, a workload OU here. We do break it up generally within kind of our, our dev test prod OUs, but here, just a generic workload OU, um, and then our management account is, is our root account here. Um, so when we're setting up Security hub and we want to set that up across the whole entire environment, we need to, of course, make sure organizations is, is enabled, um, and then from that management account, right, or root account, if we wanted to be able to go delegate and configure security hub into a security audit account or security tooling account, we need to go enable it, um, in that account and, and pass the delegation over to it. And then finally, once that delegation has happened, uh, we wanna also ensure that all of our workload accounts are configured so that way we also have situational awareness of what's happening in those accounts. And then finally, um, if you've used Security Hub, there are some frameworks that do require, uh, some, uh, uh, config uh metrics and alarms to be in place, uh, logging events like cloud trail feeding it in, uh, so that way it could go in and. Um, help, you know, identify findings and, and, and configure it so again, pretty standard, um, architecture here for many of the AWS security services that you want to have delegated over to a separate account and then enabled across your whole entire environment and then across, um, all of your regions that you have enabled, um, but you'll see, right? So 6 steps here to be able to go, uh, get that done if you were kind of going through the console. the So in the LZA as Bo was talking about, we use, uh, YAML files to be able to go describe the environment that we want to build, um, so in this case, uh, you'll, what you'll see is the kind of the top level here, the delegated admin account we want it to be our audit, uh, this is just setting up one standard, just the foundational security best practices, um, and then you'll see the series of, of, uh. Uh, config rules and, and metrics and alarms that we have configured as well. So if you're familiar with the LZA I've used it before, this is in our security config YAML. Um, this, these are the inputs that go into the LZA to be able to then drive the CDK engine. The net result is that you end up with um the cloud formation templates that um will deploy out all of those resources so there's about 14 resources just to be able to go enable all of the um architecture elements that we had in the diagram before. Um, what this doesn't take into account though is all of those orchestration steps, right? So the landing zone accelerator also has a deployment pipeline that's with it and it understands the A, then B, then C, uh, orchestration and dependencies that, that, that, that need to be done, um, and what stacks need to go when. So kind of working our way down now, um, again like I said, the LZA is an open source project that QR code just goes to our GitHub repository, uh, if you wanted to go in and and look at the code there that's where our documentation is that's where we, um, take intake from our our our customers and then get, get, and, and that's where we put out, um, you know, different road map items and issues and kind of our release notes for, for, for our, our solution, um. The way that our mono repo is broken up, it is a TypeScript project. Uh, we are using TypeScript because it is, uh, CDK. We are exercising the CDK directly, um, so we just wanted to stay very tight and close with, um, with, with, uh, the way the CDK project is built. Uh, there's 4 major modules or, or, uh, packages within our mono repo. Uh, we have our top level accelerator project that has our top level CDK. Um, uh, application and all of the different stacks that are, uh, represented when you go deploy out the, the LZA. Uh, we have a separate config package because we share that across our code base. Uh, so we just, uh, you know, leaning in, in code and had it as a separate library. Um, and then same with the library approach, any of our custom constructs that we're building, so, um, again, we want to stay very close to the paradigm that is CDK. So again, you have your stacks, and then the stacks utilize constructs. Those constructs represent collections of cloud formation objects or resources that you want to have deployed. So any of our LZA specific ones we, we keep in our constructs library. Um, and then finally we've extended out a, a little bit past the CDK and we've been building out a module library as well, and these modules, um, can be, um, you know, used outside the LZA. They can be integrated, uh, but what this allows us to do is a lot of the things that we're historically doing in custom resources, uh, we're starting to move those over into modules so we could just go call, um, the APIs and the service, uh, clients directly. So, we're going to get into code and all code and design documents start with the, with the flow chart. So, here's kind of the call flow for, um, what we, what we were building out earlier with the, um, With the security hub use case, but it, it again, it is a CDK application and it all starts from our accelerator project. So from the accelerator package where you go in and we load in our configuration, we ask the config library to load it for us. It does some initial validation checks, make sure that, you know, the syntax is good, um, and then after that's loaded, we start working through each one of the stacks that we have, um, as part of the solution. So that then goes over to our modules. Uh, we have moved again, like I was saying, some of our items that we had in custom resources, we're just calling the modules directly now. Uh, one of those are are, for example, setting up our security hub, uh, frameworks and just ensuring security hub is working. And then finally we start really getting into the meat of the CDK project, um, or the CDK stack here and in this case we're building our security resources stack. Our security resources stack has the config rules, the metrics and alarms among other, uh, kind of security service related resources that are in there, um, that, that it deploys. But those constructs and those libraries, if they're from our custom constructs library, uh, we'll fetch them out of there, um, but then when we're able to go use the the the ones that are, um, you know, that, that, that are resident in the normal CDK project, we'll utilize those as well so. Yeah, so I'm gonna start working our way down. We're gonna go kind of look at the code a little bit, um, this is our kind of create security resources stack, um, little call out here, um, we have built the landing zone accelerator to be able to go to work in, in every region, every commercial region, um, as well as our, um, our, our non-commercial regions and, and other partitions in here, so. Uh, a big part of our code from, from day one was ensuring that we are writing region safe and, and partition safe code. Um, so if you're in partitions like GovCloud, um, or, or, or other regions like that, um. Uh, the, the LZA will work in those, those environments, um, so this specific stack, um, what's great about CDK is it allows us to be able to go right, uh, higher level logic, right? We can go in and, and understand whether or not the stack should. Even be included or built out as part of our deployment engine. So in our pipelines, um, what you'll see is that, you know, we have the orchestration of we're doing our organi organization steps in, in, in this stage we're doing our security resources in this stage we're doing our networking in another, uh, we, we go in and we verify at that stage that that we are doing the right stacks that are there. Um, and then lastly, if you're familiar with CDK, it's just a pure, uh, invocation of our security resources stack. So we instantiate that object, um, we pass in the descriptions, we have our own specific synthesizer that, that we're building, so that way this allows us to be able to go in and deploy and synthesize, um, multiple stacks at one time. Um, we are really trying to take advantage of the compute that we're on. Uh, to be able to go generate all of the, you know, the hundreds or thousands of stacks that we'll have to deploy across the, uh, the environment that you may have. Great, so kind of double clicking what does that security stack, uh, actually look like? Uh, we try to, we're trying our best we know our, our code is open source, so we know that, um, we have customers and and partners that are looking at it so we're trying our best to keep it as readable as possible, um, and, and this is. Uh, a literal pluck of that, that, uh, that construct constructor within that stack. So, um, you'll see that we try to go encapsulate and functions, the, the smaller pieces. Um, this is. This has made it easier for us to test. We can go in and, and test each one of these functions at a much smaller micro level, um, and then kind of the, you know, the theme of, of reinvent this year makes it a lot easier for our, um, AI tools to be able to better understand the, the code that's there. So if we're, we're, we're leaning in and, and, um, using tools like like Qiro and all that to be able to go in and, and help us, um, uh, evaluate some of the code and, and, uh, help author it, so. Um, so we'll click in a little bit further. So we're looking at setting up the AWS config rules here. Um, this is the create AWS config roles function, and you'll see in that, um, YAML file we had, we had a list of rules that we want to deploy, and this is pure, uh, serial logic that we get to go take advantage of, um, because we're inside CDK. So again, uh, other, other solutions, cloud formation is great, um, however, you know, the reason. We have CDK so that way we can make a little bit more logic based, uh, decisions as we're, um, deciding what resources we can put in our stack. uh, cloud formation does support logic, um, but, uh, if you're familiar with it, it, it is, um, this is a lot more easier to go express when it's written as code here. Uh, as we work through that list here, we, we're able to go see whether or not the rule is a custom role if, or if it's one of the regular managed config roles, and we just pass that on over to our, um, our constructs library or the standard CDK constructs library to go instantiate and build out those, those, uh, config roles. Um, and then, um, you know, if, if you're, the other features that we support with config, uh, also supports remediation. So if you have custom remediations for any of your manage rules, or, uh, remediations for any of the, uh, roles that you define in general, we would be able to go in and deploy those there. And then finally, one of the big callouts here, uh, is that this is a CDK project. It is ultimately cloud formation that's generated at the end, uh, with the landing zone accelerator, we're able to go determine all of the dependencies that are happening with resources that are above it so. Uh, in this case, uh, we know that, um, you know, we can't create our config roles if we don't have the config recorder enabled, and the config recorder is also deployed in the stack, um, kind of, kind of north of the function, but we have to set those dependencies to ensure, uh, that the config recorder is generated before, um. Uh, before any of our config roles are, are done and same, same is true all across the board for many of our, uh, stacks within, within the landing zone accelerator. One of the value adds that we have in there is to really make sure that it's able to go handle those dependencies. And then finally, um, what you'll see is the, the cloud formation, right, that, that generates it, um, those are the, um. The, the cloud formation that's generated by the CDK. So, kind of, um, We talked about a little bit earlier, um, as, as far as you know, that's how we build these environments, the definitions of what good looks like as far as environments, um, and how to be able to go in and have these, these secure environments both touched on a little bit with our universal configuration, um, but these links here are to kind of to, to, uh, uh, two sites. So the first one is a blog that kind of goes into a lot more detail about what we're doing from a digital sovereignty. Uh, perspective, utilize, utilizing the landing zone accelerator. Um, and the second one is our universal configuration for the LZA. Um, what you'll find inside that GitHub repository is not just the configurations themselves, but the documents. So, we try to really go into detail about, um. The, the rationalization and the reasoning that we had of like why are OU structures the way it is, why we chose certain config rules, um, so a lot of the, again, the reasoning behind the decisions that, that went into that architecture, to be able to go then, um, give you the information needed when you go look at our compliance workbook, that's an artifact, and looking at it more from the control's perspective of why was that config role added or why was that SCP added, um, and that clause there. So, um, and, um, Lastly, um, I, I'm gonna go back a slide here because I, I kind of wanted to get through all that because I know there's, there's gonna be questions and all that we want to leave room for questions, but, um, we're part of the, uh, the, the cloud ops, uh, talk track this year, so come check out the kiosk. There is swag there. So, I'm, I'm gonna go back to this because, uh. I saw people, um, kind of taking pictures there but kinda happy to, uh, answer any questions that might come up um happy to discuss the LZA um in general and then kind of how that fits in with the with the use cases that that y'all have. If there's any questions. It's a good question, um, regarding data so sorry about that it's launch, uh. 2 boys. lots. this A second Directly in the AWS surveillance. Yeah, yeah, I'll try to repeat the question here. So once the, uh, sovereign cloud region is launched, um, will I need to go, uh, deploy out two LZAs, one in our global regions and then one in the, in the, in the sovereign regions. So, um, did I capture that correctly? I think um. Yeah, so the, the kind of the, the answer there is, uh, you know, depending on, so when we talk about the sovereign regions or we talk about even our commercial regions and you're building it out there, um, you can go deploy out your LZA today to be able to go, go build, um, you know, specifying the region that, that you wanna have it deployed in. As we start expanding out and we start talking about separate partitions that are not part of our commercial region, those don't have any connection points between each one of the, the partitions, right? Um, so that would be a separate, uh, instantiation or a separate landing zone that, that you would be building out because the, the best way that that you would think about it is even if you're doing this in, in commercial regions, you're, you're gonna have two separate organizations, you're gonna have two separate management accounts that are there, so. Um, and, and, and then that kind of affords you the, the opportunity to, to decide, right? Like some customers want to just stay within that that sovereign region or um if you have use cases or compliance, um, to be able to go utilize both, then you would have both of those environments. OK. Yeah. Any other questions? Uh, when will LA support, uh, and here's a. I guess the the one that support is busy. Um, are you talking about the features of Security hub or the security hub frameworks? The hub, the new, uh, service. The CSPM, yeah, um. Yeah, uh, we, we've definitely received market signal from, from customers, right? Like one of the feedback mechanisms we have since, you know, we are open source is, um, we see it internally and externally, so I think we're aiming for second half of, uh, no, not second half, some apologies, uh, second quarter of 2026 right now on our roadmap for, for that service. Oh yes, you. So for the um the module input uh it's basically all the animal files populate how it's gonna lay out the. Yeah, and to me that screams kind of with all the AI talk of some sort of an agent. To help guide that that input, do you see anything like that on the road map? Yeah, I, I think it would be, so the question is, with the YAML file and the editing of it, um, and, um, you know, definitely all the talks of agents and AI tooling that's out there, how does that relate? Um, I, I think it's safe to, to, to say that like we are leaning very heavily into the AI space. So when we're talking about MCPs and ensuring that the structure of our, um, YAML files is, uh, amenable to, to those tools, um, we're very much looking in that space. So, um, yes, the, the, the LZA is definitely moving towards that direction, um, hopefully more information to come very soon on that. Cool. Question up front. Yeah, I'm just wondering, um. Cloud migration or implementation, so. Probably not a lot of organizations here that are greenfield. Uh, we already have lets on. It's hopefully already in cos you have. Have you had contact with customers that have moved to this? Yeah, yeah, so the question is around migration. So, so yes, we've, we've seen a lot of customers that have already existing, um, um. Uh, existing landing zones, existing organizations, right, existing resources that are already deployed within, uh, AWS, and, and how can they go take advantage of the, of the, of the landing zone accelerator, um, there's kind of a few approaches that, that we've seen, um, some like all the way from one spectrum where customers are looking at it as an opportunity to go retire that environment because it was kind of stitched together and be able to go migrate those workloads over. Um, so treating it as a green field, um, and then we've also seen customers just piecemeal utilizing, let's say the security services of the, of the LZA, right, to be able to go in and take advantage of your SCP management and your security services that are there and just, you know, once you have production workloads and your networking is pretty set and, and all, all of that's pretty static, like you tend to not wanna go touch that. Um, that being said, with, uh, CDK and cloud formation allowing, um, resource assumption and management of, of existing resources, that is something that we're looking at to be able to go allow, uh, imports into the, the LZA of, of existing resources so we can go interact with them and start manage managing them going forward. Um, it's also a focus of kind of our modules here to be able to go. Uh, understand what has already been deployed in an environment like Security hub and then looking at the configuration that's provided, be able to go then shift it to that, that manifest, if you will, right? That, that explicit I want it to be able to go look this way, so. One more question. Sure, so how strict. Organizational structure and your own structures. Yeah, so the, the landing zone accelerator is broken up into, so the question was how, uh, strongly do customers have to uh adhere to the organizational structure, um, and account structure that's within the landing zone accelerator. So the, the, the LZA is broken into two parts. One part is the deployment engine, um, we kind of went through the, the code base a little bit of, of how that works. And then there's a configuration that you, that you feed it, which we have within our, um, like for example, our, our universal configuration. Um, the engine itself will deploy out whatever you tell it to deploy, uh, through the, the AAMO file so you can tell that I want this organization structure. I want these accounts that are deployed out to, to, you know, these OUs, um, you're very much in control of what, what's there. Uh, however, when we're talking about kind of highly prescriptive environments and, and environments that are really, you know, kind of taking advantage of a lot of the compliance work that we've put in. That's why we built out the universal configuration, right? To be able to be a lot more. This is how we would build an organizational structure with the controls in place, with the SEPs in place, if you wanted to be able to go quickly, hydrate and stand up in the environment today. Um, so, long-winded way of, of, of, of answering your question of, you can ask the LZA to go deploy whatever you want. Um, however, we have opinions about what you should probably go deploy based off of our well architected frameworks and our, our security reference architectures. Yeah. Any other questions? OK. So, um, Bo and I will, um, obviously stick around for a bit. I'm happy to kind of dive into kind of more details on, on what is in the landing zone accelerator and kind of, um, what we're doing, um, uh, especially within, within the sovereign region space, um, so if there's any other questions feel free to kinda, kinda come by, um, we'll we'll hang out outside and obviously in here for, for the, the foreseeable time, but, um. Yeah, if you have an opportunity again, the Cloud Ops kiosk is, is in the village. Um, they have, they have swag and demos and, uh, and, uh, uh, workshops that are available that's over there, but, um. Yeah, I appreciate uh you coming and taking the time to uh hear about what we're doing.
