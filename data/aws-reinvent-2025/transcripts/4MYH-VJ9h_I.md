Thank you. My name's Pete DiStefano. I'm with SolarWins. I'm here with Ryan Lauer from Paquiolen. Uh, we are gonna spend some time today kind of taking you down their cloud journey. So let me quickly take you through the agenda. We got industry challenges, artificial intelligence, Pecky Owen's overview, uh, Generative AI, uh, the cloud journey of Pacquiolan, uh, artificial intelligence, AI, agentic AI, OK. I just wanted to make sure we got a few words in there about AI because I know we wanna kind of get the jump on all the people here cause nobody out here has talked about AI yet. So I thought we'd come out there and start with that. Seriously, we will probably talk a little bit about AI later on, but we are gonna take you through, uh, Ryan and his company's journey. But before I do that, I wanna talk a little bit about industry challenges that we're all facing. Now, I'm not gonna read this list, whether it's troubleshooting or root cause analysis, visibility gaps. If I had to boil challenges that you're all facing today, one of them is time. Time when things are not going right, time when things are down. And really, what does that really boil down to? It's the challenge of delivering on services in today's very complex environment. So I'm not sure what your environment looks like. You might be pure cloud, you might be pure on-prem, you might be some hybrid world. I believe most of us are in some type of hybrid environment. Well, you're gonna hear a lot more about solar winds and this concept of operational resilience. Well, resilience, what are you guys who are working in an industry means when something goes wrong, how quickly, how resilient can I be? How quickly can I get up and running? Well, operational resilience is the concept of, I know something is gonna go wrong. I might have a bad change that causes an issue. I might have a bug in some software or a system that goes down. How can I plan for the fact that things are gonna happen? How do I plan for when there is an issue, I can continue to deliver a level of service without any impact to my business. That's what our entire company, our portfolio is about, is helping you become operationally resilient. Now, Our goal is to help you and your people be able to be operational resilient, and that's with the workflows, the processes, and of course, the technologies that you're using to support and observe your IT environment. Now, instead of me talking about that, what I'd like to do is we're gonna have Ryan talk about why time is of the essence within his company. And how important, how critical it is to deliver on service for the success of his company. So Ryan, why don't you take us, uh, through who Pacquiolan is. So here at Pacquiolan, what we do is live event ticketing, and most of our clients, uh, are in the college athletics arena. So what we do is we provide people the ability to buy the tickets, scan them at the stadium when they come in, um, and there's. Different times that we have, um, traffic spikes, and that's basically centered around the time that we do on sales for our clients, um, when we have people coming into the stadiums and scanning and coming into the, the stadium and stuff like that. All right, so, especially this time of year, uh, I'm so thankful that Pacquiolen was willing to spend time with us, cause this is really the bread and butter part of their year, and they're spending time with us. So thank you for that. Let's, let's kind of go through a little bit of this journey that Pacquiolen has gone through. Let's start with just talking about, tell us about your IT environment. I know you're hybrid, right? Correct. We have, um, a couple of Kubernete's clusters, some in EKS, some on-premises, and, um, we have different AWS architecture that also works with some of our other on-premises architecture. OK, so. I talked about challenges just a moment ago. I talked about things like root cause, getting to the root cause quickly or um how does, do I understand, do I have visibility to everything? What are some of the historical challenges Pacquiolan has had? So, when we started to containerize and move all of our on-premises, um, services to a microservice architecture in either EKS or on-premises Kubernetes, some of the challenges we found where we weren't sure how some services would interact with other services, um, and how they would act being containerized is, instead of being, say, in a beanstalk or an EC2. Um, and what we did is we installed the SolarWinds APM which helped us kind of get an insight into how our services were interacting with other services, any kind of network latencies or anything like that that we could find, um, SolarWinds would show us in their dashboards, and then that way we could better tune our services. We can set more realistic limits and requests based on what we see in our traffic. All right, so you've been using. They've been using solar winds, uh, for a while, and there's a variety of different tools, but what was the new approach you guys decided to use and, and why? So, the 8 p.m. was relatively new. Um, we kind of wanted to see how everything would interact with each other as we were doing our migrations and then when we do those big on sales or we have those big football Saturdays where people are coming into the stadium and scanning their tickets, we wanted to be able to have insight into how all of those services were acting as well as our infrastructure so that we could see CPU memory, disk rights, um, network that. Kind of stuff with our infrastructure as well as the APM and then also show all of our AWS infrastructure behind that single pane of glass that SolarWinds gives us so that we can sit behind and look at these dashboards and say we have a dashboard for SREs, we have a dashboard for development for customer service, everybody watches their own dashboards to be able to tell how their services are reacting. Um, what kind of impact they're seeing in, in their different areas. Yeah, would you mind telling the folks what you had to do this morning? So yeah, this morning, there's um there's a couple of big on sales. I know bowl selections are coming. Um, so, as I was watching the AWS keynote, I was monitoring our on sales. Um, our sister company Side Arm also has early signing day today, which is a big day in college athletics. A lot of people are coming to the sites, um, just to see, you know, who their colleges are picking from the, the high school students. And what we like to see is how everything's operating, and the SolarWinds dashboards gives us that, as well as setting up alerts for some of those key services and bottlenecks that we, we've seen in the past. We set up alerts so that if we kind of see something going wrong, we're notified well before our clients are calling us saying, hey, our systems are down. All right, thanks. So you've been an AWS customer 89 years. Uh, yeah, it's been about 8 years, I believe. So you know what, what have been the benefits of now leveraging AWS because you guys migrated from on-prem into the cloud? Why AWS? So AWS gives us the ability to scale quickly if we're noticing that our nodes are high. On memory or CPU from one of our dashboards, we can go ahead and scale up. If we notice our services or, or maybe a service is getting bottlenecked, the request time isn't kind of where we are, isn't where we want it to be. We can always scale those services up. And AWS and EKS allow us to do that to whereas on-prem, it's a little more, requires more planning to add hardware into our clusters. All right, so, monitoring, you monitor a network. You monitor a database, you monitor an application. Why observability? Just so that we can get a jump on any issues we see and we can better plan for the upcoming on sales for the upcoming football seasons. We know where our services are at. And even though we do a lot of our changes in the off time during the summer, um, come full load, and even though we do load testing unit, sometimes it just doesn't react the same way as live traffic. So what we like to do is, is those first couple of weeks, we, we're all on a call, we're watching our dashboards and making sure we're all talking to each other, making sure that everything is working the way we want it to. And if we start to see issues, um, we can make adjustments right then and there and solar winds. Gives us the ability to do that with the real-time metrics for either our APMs or Kubernetes clusters, EC2s, databases, stuff like that. All right, well, thanks. So, first of all, I didn't mention AI once through his whole, uh, but don't get me wrong, I will get that in here in the next couple of minutes before we're done. And by the way, if you do have any questions, I've just got a couple more slides. We'd like to open it up if you have any questions for Ryan or, or for myself. So, I do wanna talk a little bit about SolarWinds and our overall platform across the board. On the left, you'll see our observability offerings. And I say monitoring observability cause monitoring is a key element. It's a foundational element of observability. But if you truly want to understand the state of your system, you need to look at all the elements together. And as Ryan said, when you have multiple teams, being able to look and have the same single source of truth, and to be able to look at the the impact that um a database or an application or an Structure is having on the overall system and looking at it together on a platform. That's why we've built out a full stack observability platform. And with SolarWinds, you can do that from SAS or you can do it from on-prem. Your call, full stack, wherever your stack is running, you can run at SAS or on-prem. We've included incident response to really connect the dots between all of the things that are happening in real-time and communicating to the people that need to solve that problem. And then to complete the life cycle, all integrated into our service management offering. So whether it's your help desk, your problem, your change management, your incident response, and your monitor observability at SolarWinds, we believe these three things together. Can help your people, your processes and workflows, and help you with your technologies to be operational resilient. Now, just to give you an idea on the, on the, whoops, sorry, to give you an idea, when I talk about full stack, when I talk about observability offerings, we're talking about your networks, your infrastructure, your applications, your user experience. To not understand the user's perspective of availability and performance, you're not looking at the whole picture. It doesn't matter how many green lights you have in your network operating center. What matters is the user's perspective of performance. So being able to look at all that stuff collectively is really important, um, as well as your databases and security, and by the way, all built on a common platform. That delivers dashboards and alerting, intelligent alerting systems, and yes, machine learning engine, generative AI and newly announced agentic AI. We'd love you to come by our booth, 1380. Let our guys show you some of the stuff that Ryan and Pacquiolen is doing, and some of the other things that SolarWinds can bring to the table, so you can understand how your company could be operationally resilient. Any questions for Ryan or myself? Thank you for taking the time.
