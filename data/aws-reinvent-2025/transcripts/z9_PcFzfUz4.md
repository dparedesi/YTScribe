summary: "This session, \"Transforming Supply Chains with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore (API206),\" features Chris Bingham, AWS Ambassador and Country CTO for Switzerland at Fujitsu. He discusses how Fujitsu's Uvance decision intelligence offering uses AI to assist supply chain managers in dealing with volatility, disruption, and transformation. The talk highlights a real-world use case where their AI solution helped a customer assess the impact of an earthquake on their supply chain in just 2 hours, compared to 3 days for competitors. Bingham explains how they overcame the challenge of \"agent drift\"—where AI agents lose relevance over time—by re-architecting their solution using Amazon Bedrock Agents (referred to as Agent Core in the talk). This new architecture provides a unified platform for agent lifecycle management, observability, and integration. They introduced a \"Guardian Agent\" that uses observability data and human feedback to detect drift and automatically update prompts, ensuring agents remain aligned with business context. The session includes a demo showing significant cost savings and resource efficiency improvements."

Hello, welcome everybody. Thank you for coming. So yeah, I'm Chris Bingham, I'm the AWS Ambassador and country CTO for Switzerland at Fujitsu. And uh A Fujitsu, we're applying AI to real business issues that are beyond just code generation, which we've heard a lot about today and this week at Reinvent, with the aim of aiding and accelerating skilled people, such as supply chain managers. So what challenges do supply chain managers face? Well, not being one myself, I did the 2025 thing and I asked an AI and it told me uh all of this. Uh, the answer, lots and varied challenges. But I feel they can be summarized with three key words, volatility, disruption, and transformation. Anybody else experiencing those things in mayor work these days? It's a bit of a common theme, isn't it? So Overall, supply chain management involves working with a lot of rapidly shifting data. Across many, many dimensions and sources, from suppliers, from customers, from customs and regulators, from manufacturing, through to sales and every business unit in between. And of course this kind of high complexity, high dimensionality scenario is exactly where AI excels. Particularly where AI works with experienced professionals. Domain experts who can wield AI to achieve positive business impacts, and creating positive impacts through data and AI is at the core of Fujitsu's Uvan decision intelligence offerings. A key tenet of Uvan's decision intelligence is to enable your teams through data and AI. By providing solutions which act as companions, supporting you in your work through the combination of Fujitsu's technical expertise and your domain expertise. This approach delivers high quality decisions at pace with the aim of creating positive business and social impact. And in this spirit, our teams applied their domain knowledge to create a solution to help supply chain management. Our first generation solution was built to aid supply chain managers through automation and AI. It leveraged AI agents to intelligently help with balancing inventory, and crucially, with managing adverse effects and disruptions. For example, this screenshot shows the supply chain effects of an earthquake which occurred in January 2024. In this case, this real world case, our customer was able to quantify the impact of this earthquake on the supply chains and begin mitigation within 2 hours. Their competitors, by comparison, had to work around the clock for 3 days to get to the same point. Which sounds wonderful. However, this version of our solution faced some technical challenges. In a nutshell, speed. Agentic AI like all other uses of AI is only effective when it's attuned to reality. And here our first generation approach was limited. Lacking a single cohesive platform for managing agent life cycles, the very pieced together architecture which we had hindered our ability to adapt agents to changing circumstances. Unchecked, this would lead to agent drift. Agents moving away from the business context over time, resulting in the relevance and quality of their responses degrading, leading to negative impact on the business outcomes our customers could achieve. So how did we build a solution which could rise to this challenge of agent drift? Well, we're at Reinvent, so naturally enough with AWS. Specifically, Bedrock Agent Core provides that single coherent platform for managing our agents' life cycles. Agent Core replaced the mishmash of components at the heart of our AI agents with a single joined up platform. This simplified architecture diagram illustrates how Agent Core integrates into our Uvan SCM solution. Agent Care Runtime provides, naturally enough, the runtime environment for all of our AI agents. Agent Core Gateway handles the integration of all of the supply chain data sources and tools which those agents need, whilst Agent Core Identity manages centralized access control for all of those agents against all of those tools and data sources. And last but by no means least, agent core observability provides deep insights into the how and the why of AI agent performance. And that final piece, agent core observability is the linchpin to how we addressed the challenge of agent drift. By creating yet another AI, yes, more AI on top of AI, the guardian agent, as we call it. The guardian agent is tasked with guarding against drift. It works to identify cases where our SCM agent's responses have started to degrade and then acts to correct that drift based on both agent core observability data and supply chain managers' feedback. The Uvan SCMUX includes opportunities for supply chain managers to provide qualitative feedback on the business performance of the agents. This enables Evamp's SCM to capture any shifts in that business performance independently of any technology metrics. The Guardian agent can then combine that business performance feedback with observability data from from Agent Core. Most especially the chain of thought data like the example which we see here, to work out where in that chain of thought, the agent has started to drift. Yep. And in doing so, formulate modifications to the prompts used for that agent. These prompt updates are then stored in a central Dynamo DB prompt table and utilized the next time that drifting agent is called. This means that automated analysis of and reaction to agent drift is triggered by human feedback. By supply chain managers identifying insufficient business context fit implicitly through their feedback, creating a human centric approach to evolving the AI agents which are supposed to help the humans. So with that, I'm now gonna show you a quick video demonstration of UA SCM. And hopefully we'll get the audio. I'd like to show you a demonstration. When the project started, the customer had 1000 people working under one SCM operation. Their resources were aging, and young veteran workers were expected to retire in 3 years. Reducing the required resources was one of their most pressing challenges. Their most labor intensive task was ordering components. They had about 50 to 100 workers at each plant collect task only because their systems were silent. They had to manually calculate the inventory to identify access and stock items using Excel sheets. One person could cover up to just 10 items, so they needed 1000 people to cover their global operation. So they built this dashboard. Now all they have to do is to solve all modifications from the system. This dashboard is now used by the company's top management and also by procurement team. Here in this view, you can see the carry train at one. Factoring in its procurement, production, sales. I haven't seen that can do the same. The yellow dot indicates the time for religion. The red dot indicates stockout, but the purple part shows the opportunity to be lost due to suckout. The blue line shows the optimal airing to according to a dedicated prediction model generated by our evolution. In just two months, the AI generated accurate prediction models with error rates of less than 10%. 4300 component categories covering 1.2 million Espanos up 2 million Ecas. Leading to more than $10 million cost saving, also contributing to resource saving from 1000 to 500. So by just following this blue line, the customer only reduced the cost associated with the vas manual costs, but also increased the revenue, avoiding the loss of sales opportunities. The value generated so far is significant as you can see, but if we s We can aim to have the necessary resources again from 500 FDs to 250 FDAs. In these operation labs, humans take actions by checking automatic alerts from the system. But we are now in the AI age, where further automation for even larger business market is possible. As this view is just for demonstration, state out alerts are rounded up in. and using money. But in the actual operation, alerts are automatically processed by those languages. So while those ages are places in the past. agency. This job description defines what the agent is expected to be, and the returns to find what data connects us and what actions it. The selected a here are moved from left to right in the compound scale as the agents crosses them. The orchestrated agent selects the best solution from those agents answers. These agents are evaluated according to these indicators, and that the farmers are trained according to humans. If AI agents, in other words, Jen design with certain songs were implemented aftercoming sound data works are integrated and streaming, and how to be able to take appropriate actions based on health understanding. This illustrates the concept of Fujitsu devices, which is to add business value from tens of millions to hundreds of millions of dollars through reorganization and export implementation by solving entire problems using the same thing. He can see all your wise hands in the winter. So, for example, in this dashboard, when an earthquake occurs, the system identifies its impact on the customer supply chain. Most companies can manually calculate livestreams using excel sheets, such as which suppliers and components are likely to. But identifying the impact such as which is extraordinary. and and we will. 202, the peninsula in Japan. This custom was able to Ballpark within 2 hours. The officers at Japan's Electronics Manufacturing Industry Association spent 3 days without sleep to do the same thing. Japan is an ethnic farm country, but the same approach applies to many natural disasters, including hurricanes and flood, deal with cos such as the recent declaration of Martian. OK, so to summarize. Our customers are seeing meaningful boosts to their SCM team's efficiency from deploying Evan SCM leading to significantly more rapid responses to incidents within their supply chain. And thanks to Bedrock Agent Core's capabilities, we've been able to accelerate the integration of new data sources, such as may come when you have a new supplier, by roughly an order of magnitude. And these benefits together improve your resilience, both against everyday issues and major adverse events. And with that, if you'd like to learn more about Evan SCM or any of the other solutions we offer, please do come and visit us, we're at booth 1851, which is roughly in that direction. Uh, or please connect with us online via the QR code here, and we will happily arrange for our experts to come and meet with you after Reinvent at your convenience.
