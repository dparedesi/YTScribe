Hi guys, welcome. Uh, guys, now we want to talk about one thing that very special that we created in Brasilia, capital city from Brazil. So we are a pair of user groups in Brazil. So we have a challenges that create fun events, so many tasks, many process to do, and what thing, oh, how can you use. AWS services to improve more and create one thing and centralize that with diverse services and keep more energy in things that very are special that care people engaged people so I'm Priscilla Rausjo. I'm business developer at Claro Brazil and today we have Dan Andy. Uh, I'm a solutions architect and leader of community AWS community in. Nice. So guys, we are more than 400 groups around the world in Brazil, more than 220. So we have very challenge that to create, have fun events, and many tasks and process and platforms, so. You can, as you can see, we are defining events details, speakers, dates, registrations, design, cre, registration, so many tasks, more than 20. How can we do this 11 place and use AWS is the challenge. So we have uh some communities and deliveries now in this year we have a famous event from NAS called AWS Summit in Sao Paulo. So now Sao Paulo, we did the one special in VP. We send a lot of message to people around in the event and call them to engage in in the community lounge. It's amazing. So a lot of message that we sent to them and again. And interacting with us, it's cool. And now we have 22 events that we did in Brasilia and one with, uh, without the platform and then another with the platform so we can check some details and data that show us that did its work. So now we can see one message that we sent to the people, uh, for the WhatsApp. And we have some data that show us that it's very works in our community. So now in this side we have uh um 119 that you can see day 9 here, 1109 uh views uh in the first event and the other side we have more 2020. 7% views because we send messages in the second event on the other hand, we have a lot of like it. People like more than we can see, so people like more. 28 more are posted in our networks after that receive the message through WhatsApp. Oh, we are Brazilian and we love so a lot memes, so we send memes to our community lounge people in NAS summit in Sao Paulo and then can check the care code and then link it and can connect with us through this platform. Guys, how to use AWS to create fun. So now I can. Asking you then what you did is the is the better part is now. Uh, thanks, Pre. Uh, I'm going to demonstrate now how we evolved, uh, from a simple MVP into a production reed architecture built on AWS. Our first MVP is intentionally simple. We use Amplify to speed up development, S3 for stat key content, and a basic API manages simple actions like uh event triggers and messaging. Amplify enable uh application development in AWS, asset 3 for assets, messages on me and API gateway inside the ECU. Uh, Cloudwa for monitoring, very simple. This helped us the test, validate the idea fast, but I knew I wouldn't scale. This is a true MVP, very, very simple, but fast to test. But I have a challenge. Are more communities joined? We need better scalability, stronger security, and more flexible, uh, services to build the new features, uh, faster. And then I'm called Priscilla again to involve the community for solve this challenge. So, uh, we think, oh, we have a lot of talent developers in our community, so we can use this strong force to create something together. So why the reason that we collaborated in communities in Brasilia, Guyana, Sao Paulo, Belen, and the other community users that create together one thing that we call it. Yes, yes, this collaboration, uh, guided to architecture, and I, I understood what we, you do need, uh, and define, define the next steps. Now I have this architecture, uh, production read architecture be for moot community platform. We decide to use Hot 53 to host domain and manage Deas. Cloud Front for CDN delivery content and low latency anywhere in the world. WAF for security protects the application for filtering malicious requests. The frontier layer is served by the S3 and Cloud Front for fast and high. Back in the API run in ECS frigate deployed across multivibi zones. Back in in the API runs uh. Inside the the ACS on Fargate application load balancer halt and distributed the requests around the Fargate desks for network and security, use public and private subnets are uh cross AZ for increased security, navigator for, uh, connection on internet. For database layer, we use the Amazon Aurora moot AZ to improve his reliency and availability. SCR stores image containers image for notifications. SNS handles HTTP in the webhook notifications, um. SES for send transactions in mail like uh registration, confirmation, invites, new meetups, and the others. Uh, for observability, finally, for observability, cloudwa, cloudwa for metrics, alarms, uh, and cloudwa logs for ingest logs and the, uh, whatever this architectures preview provi provides a scalable, reliable, and secured, uh, in flexible, uh, architecture to support multiply WS community. And now I'm. Production red to scale, uh, that's it, Priscilla. Yo, so let's go. Let's talk about benefits. What kind of benefits we have with this platform. So now we can forget to send 20 or more messages to the people. We can just use the console to send messages before or after the events and simplify. In the past we used 10 or more inputs in different platforms. Now we can use in one place to do the whole process and new ways to advise, connect people. Now we can use a platform to connect the people more efficiently, and I calculate estimate more than 70 hours per year, save it to keep more energy in the people, to engage with the people, to have fun. That's the that's the goal. So now we have the face of our console, um, that's called uh party community because we have fun we love so much to have a a great moments together and through this we can make a management of all events, community days, uh, meetups and summits, uh, whatever, uh, the community wants to organize we can do through this platform. So guys, um, if you want to connect with us, uh, we have this Per, uh, care code. Feel free to connect with us. In the side we have a user group Brasilia, that group that are in PE as a leader and member. So guys, thank you for your job. You're a rock. And we have two user group Goya that then uh as a perf and uh and uh and the other guys and they are very partnered with us. So if you want to connect with us and understand more our platform and our challenges, um, feel free to connect. Hi, it's a special moment that I will share with you. A lot of uh faces that help us a lot. We are diversity because we have a lot of younger girls work as a developer in our team only for free as. A volunteer a lot of commits in the GitHub. We have a GitHub too and that we share a code and the other things if you want to connect with them, feel free to follow him uh in their uh networks, OK? So thank you. Finally, finally, it's fast. So thank you and uh the final message is if you're interested in uh. Support if you have any idea or if you have a skill to code help you to increase the functionality in this platform and connect with us. If you want to connect with us here, we have our code. you can connect with me or enjoy us in up in Brazil, feel free to connect and that's my patent. So thank you. You are very talented architect. So thank you. Have a fun event event happened. That's it. Thank you.
