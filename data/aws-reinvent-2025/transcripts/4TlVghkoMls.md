summary: "This session, \"Reimagining SIEM architecture using AWS S3 Buckets (SEC346),\" presented by Vega Security, challenges the traditional, centralized Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) model. The speakers, Ellie and Iran from Vega, argue that monolithic SIEMs lead to excessive costs (\"syntax\") and data fragmentation due to the requirement of shipping all logs to a central location. They propose a \"federated architecture\" where logs remain in their native locations—primarily AWS S3 buckets—and are indexed and queried in place. This \"security analytics mesh\" allows security teams to run federated searches, correlations, and detections across disparate data repositories (S3, existing SIEMs like Splunk/Sentinel, data lakes like Snowflake) without data movement. Key benefits highlighted include a 60-80% cost reduction by eliminating egress fees and SIEM ingestion costs, improved visibility by making it affordable to retain high-volume logs (like VPC flow logs) for longer periods, and a unified \"single pane of glass\" interface using KQL (Kusto Query Language) for analysts."

Hello everyone. We are Vega. We're a start-up started in January 2024. We raised $65 million from cyberstarts, Acel, Wetpoint, and. To completely change how you do security operations and security analytics, um, and today we're gonna talk about how you can reimagine your SIM architecture using AWSS for buckets, something that we all have today, and how you can increase your visibility and get a lot more out of your data without compromising on costs and breaking the bank. So, um. Just a bit on us, I'm Ellie. I'm the co-founder and CTO here at Vega. Uh, I've been building Vega together with a team for, uh, almost two years, since January 2024. I'm based in New York, originally from Tel Aviv. I've been doing cybersecurity for more than 15 years. Started on the offensive side, uh, and now on the defensive side. Actually did a lot of, uh, uh, low-level engineering, which is gonna, uh, show up in, uh, the talk today. And also Iran. Uh, hi everyone. Uh, my name is Ian, head of, uh, threat detection and research at Vega. Uh, past 10 years, roughly doing incident response, uh, threat hunting, managed the SOC in the past, uh, led engagements, uh, of incident response in a global IR firm, and today at Vega for around 1 year and a half years. Perfect. So really when we started Vega, um, we spoke with hundreds of enterprises and we asked them and spoke with them about their challenges today that they're facing with their SIM and their security operations programs. Um, and really we have, we've identified three common problems amongst almost every customer that we spoke with. The first one is growing security telemetry volume and with. You know, migration to the cloud today and multi-cloud environments, the types and volumes of security telemetry just grows year over year and you know, significantly grows, and you have cloud logs, VPC flow logs, you have all these logs that you want to be able to generate security insights from them, but it's really challenging. It's really challenging many times because of the cost constraints that are coming with the traditional architecture of the same. And really if you think about, you know, the traditional monolithic architecture requires you to send all these logs and pay for each byte of log that you're sending into your SIM and therefore you have to deal with all these cost constraints. Um, another common problem that we've seen amongst every organization or a lot of organizations is as a result of the growing data volume as well as the cost constraints, we've seen a lot of organizations who just keep. Multiple data repositories of their security telemetries. Maybe they have some in each cloud environment. Maybe they have a bunch of different SIMs. We've seen organizations with 9 different SIMs and uh different data lakes, and think about how you can deal with that. Um, and All of these, uh, uh, uh, you know, uh, problems really stem from The outdated monolithic architecture of the SIM, which requires organizations and leads, you know, engineers and, and the security operations teams to work with some assumptions of, uh, you know, what you can do and what you should do with your, with your security telemetries. And the most important assumption that we are challenging at Vega. Is telemetry, security telemetry centralization. And we're asking ourselves, why do you need to centralize and copy each byte of data that you would like to be able to monitor on? Uh, why can't you just query data in multiple data repositories instead of sending it all over the internet, uh, uh, into this one centralized data location? Another one is. Why the storage and detection, engineering and threat hunting capabilities must be coupled into the same uh monolithic system. Just like how, uh, uh, you know, we've seen data technologies that decouple storage and compute. Why? Security operations teams have to rely on a single monolithic piece that couples together their storage and the storage fees together with the security processes and outcomes that they want out of this security data. And really it also we're asking the question of why cannot you utilize multiple uh uh uh data repositories and storages, uh, maybe even your S3 buckets to achieve the outcomes that you would like out of a traditional SIM, uh, querying the data, correlating the data. And what happens really when you have multiple data repositories? Maybe uh uh that's due to MNA. Maybe you've acquired a new company and they have another SIM. Maybe as a result of data residency requirements, you have to keep data in multiple data repositories. But uh, you still want to be able to cross correlate. Uh, data across all these different repositories and even, you know, either build an a detection, right, on top of this data, maybe do some threat hunting or respond to a real incident and you would like to be able to query all this data. Fundamentally, You know, those outdated architectural assumptions that are coming with the monolithic architecture of the same really, uh, uh, uh, you know, uh, make the threat detection team as well as the architecture team, uh, uh, you know, it's, it's a huge challenge to solve these, uh, problems with the traditional tools that we have today. And let's talk about how it affects real, uh, AWS customers today. OK, so we can take uh A address as a, as an example how to uh leverage um a federated architecture to achieve security operations. So, uh let's see, uh, there's an organization they want to, uh, monitor and apply, uh, detections and threat hunting and incident response over their AWS environment. So for that, first of all, they gotta enable those logs. They are cloud trails, VPC flow logs, guard duty. So there's a fee of course for AWS to enable those services. Those services are creating logs and audits, and those logs need to be retained. So we have the AWS storage, that's your cloud watch, your S3 buckets. So you have the service creating the logs. You have now the storage there, but the team cannot really leverage those logs for any security purposes when they're simply retained in that storage. So what they gotta do in the, you know, the, the, the old fashioned way as we call it, they gotta send it to the SIM. So they gotta uh start shipping all the logs from AWS outside of Amazon and into their SIM. So this is leading for AWS egress costs. For data movement, then we have the most significant cost for the SIM ingestion and also the SIM storage because you want to retain it for a long period of time and most most SIM solutions today. Of course, um, you need to also apply security modules and this, this costs additional costs, meaning that if a security team wants to go ahead and have uh security operation capabilities on top of your AWS environment, they gotta have 6 places where they're actually spending money just to do this simple thing. Imagine there's an organization with 200, 400, even 750 ES accounts, uh, and how much money just cost just to get the data to where they can start leveraging it. So, uh, with this example, this is what we're, um, one example of one thing we're coming to, to, to fix and, and address, uh, in our federated approach. So, uh, let's see how this looks like, for example, when we do not ship the logs to the SIM. So, we got the, of course, the service, so we gotta enable those logs. Uh, we gotta store them, so in the database storage, but that's it. What basically we're doing, we're applying an indexer to index those logs exactly where they already are, where they natively already live. So we're using uh indexing computes in the same cloud, in the same region to take those logs in, let's say S3 buckets and create an index for them in the same storage. So we're, we're able to achieve that index without chipping the logs outside of AWS. The second part of this, of, of this process is to be able to run queries, threat hunting, incident response, detections, and that's where, uh, Vega is a console. Um, which is external is able to reach out to that storage, to that index, and do queries, do federated detections, do instantent response, and essentially everything a security need a team would need to, um, uh, to, to, to do detection and response over AWS. So we just have some service fees, the storage, the 3 buckets, some, some computes, but it's a small fraction of the money it actually costs when you don't need to ship it. So in this scenario, an organization with let's say 750+ HDBS accounts that can achieve these security operation capabilities with 60 up to 80% cost reduction. By doing this approach, so there's no what we call syntax. Uh, let's see 22 use cases, an example. Uh, with two organizations that we're working with who are using S3 buckets, um, to, to, um, to use the federated architecture. So one is a major e-commerce platform. They essentially had a seam solution that they use for everything they need, but they also needed to have a longer retention period, so they're shipping everything to S3 buckets just as a backup. When we started a conversation with them, we just told them, listen, all your logs are already in a, in a very low cost, high performance storage. But you're also sending it to the SIM and it costs you so much money. So essentially we're, we started to index all their logs, their firewall, EDR, Office 365, any data source that they have in estuary buckets. We just applied indexing for it exactly where it is. This made their SIM entirely redundant because they were able to create detections on top of the S3 threat hunting on top of S3 incident response the same, so they were able to churn and entirely remove the SIM and the immediate value was a 70% cost reduction in total. Um, they have the same security capabilities but even more than that because now that they have this additional cost they're able to say, right, so now I can have longer retention periods of my data. I can onboard more data that I could not have onboarded before. Let's say I can have a load balancer logs or waf logs or the EDR event telemetry, something that I say I cannot really fit in my SIM, but now that I have this extra money plus the capability to operationalize data in a low, in a low cost, high performance storage, now it's an opportunity for them. Uh, the second use case is a Fortune 500 pharmaceutical company. They had a very, very large SIM. Um, really dozens of terabytes per day. And at some point they realized that they cannot afford to send all the logs from AWS to their SIM just because of, of, of the insane amount of costs of uh that it takes. So they were looking for a solution to uh have security operations on top of their AWS without shipping it to the SIM. So, uh, we came in, we started to index all their, uh, they have a 500 or more than 500 AWS accounts. So we started to index their cloud trail, VPC flow logs, guard duty, cloudWatch, any piece of data, RDS logs, everything they needed for the security day to day. Uh, they gained full visibility, all detection capabilities on top of it, but did not ship a single log out of Amazon. Everything solely rela uh there, no egress cost at all, no syntax, um, but then you can say, but I have an issue now. I have logs for my security team in S3. But also have logs for security in the SIM, so practically what happened there is data fragmentation. Practically what happened here is the security teams need to work on two consoles, and this is what we wanted to avoid. So Vega also have that capability to go ahead and connect to an existing SIM, also an existing data lake, and also to object storage and cross correlate information that does not exist in the same place. One more slide So there are 3 core. Things that we're um focusing on. The first one is the capability to to have a correlation cross storage. If I have logs in S3, logs in my SIM, log in my Elastic, logs in my Snowflake, logs in other cloud platforms, I can still run one query that is taking these logs and these logs and cross correlating it, so the fragmentation becomes irrelevant. The second thing is hybrid data lakes, meaning that I can have uh data lake, let's call it the S3 I can have something which is the elastic and I I can have the SIM. So different data lakes of different technologies of different even query languages, but it would still work seamless. And the third thing. Is to still keep a unified security view, meaning one platform, a true real, uh, single pane of glass, even though I have different data lakes, it's still 11 console, one query language, and just one interface to work in for the team and let's see how, uh, let's see how this looks like at a high level. So you must, must be asking yourself how does this magic work behind the scenes. So this is basically what we've been working on for the last two years. And we call it SEM, Security Analytics Smash. Now, the architecture of security analytics Smash really gives you the flexibility of connecting to the data wherever it makes sense to keep the data. And you must be asking yourself, well, now I have to rip and replace my existing SIM. But no, as everyone said, one of the core capabilities of Vega is understanding that you already have made a lot of investments in your EDR platform, in your existing SIM platform, in maybe a data lake where you're shipping some of your logs. Maybe you're using a pipeline tool like a Quibble to push them to ask for buckets. Vega can help instantly operationalize all of these data repositories uh uh without moving all the data. So we can connect to any SIM, Splank, Microsoft Sentinel, Google Setups, Elastic. We can connect to any NextGen SIM and XDL platforms like the Sentinel One Data Lake or the CrowdStrike NextGen SIM. And all of the telemetries that you already have in there, they can stay in there, and over time, if you feel like it makes sense for you to move them to S3 buckets or a data lake, it's up to you. You now have the flexibility to choose where you want to store your data. Now, but the real power of Vega comes when uh uh we talk about data lakes and object storage. So we can connect to also data lakes such as data bricks or Snowflake. And if your CIO decides that, you know, you guys are going all in on a specific data lake, that's fine. That should not change uh how the security team is working or building and managing detections. But most importantly for AWS customers, Vega shines if you have a lot of data already in object storage. And if you think about most of the telemetries that are born in the cloud, or basically all of the telemetries that are born in the cloud, they are naturally born in object storage. Vega allows you to keep all the cloud logs and the VPC flow logs within those object storage. What we do is we have our own indexing technology where you don't need to ship the data to any data lake or or a SIM. We can connect and index the data within the same cloud and within the same region. This architecture makes so much more sense because there is no need to send data all over the internet. Now, think about a multi-cloud uh environment. Maybe you're using multiple clouds. We have a customer who is utilizing all three major clouds across tens of regions, and they have thousands of cloud accounts across each each cloud provider. With them we can instantly operationalize all of their data in the. The data locally, save a lot of money. This can come up to millions of dollars and even tens of millions of dollars, but still achieve all the security outcomes that they want and get visibility out to all of the security telemetries. Also, you have much more power because you can be in control over your own indexes. You can keep the indexed buckets in your AWS account. So now you have more attention, more flexibility to where you want to put your data, and less cost. Sounds good to me. Um, really, all of these data repositories are are accessible for a single KQL query interface. So our user interface and user experience is very good. People love it and especially analysts who are already familiar with the pipeline language like SPL or Microsoft Sentinel's KQL we leverage the same KQL so it's easy to get started instantly, um, uh uh and, and get your sock uh to be familiar with the system. We also obviously leverage a lot of AI and LLM capabilities within the product to, to make, uh, uh, uh, asking simple questions really easy. And I think the most important piece is that this is the foundation for an AI native security operations, because once you have this single semantic data layer across all of your security telemetries in every data repository, you can now achieve the AI outcomes that you want out of your data, because we all know that your AI triage, AI detections, AI ability to respond to threats is only as good to be, is only as good as the data that the AI and LLM can access. Now we're almost out of time, but uh if you would like to chat more, we'll be at our booth 1928. We're also gonna give some hotdogs. So uh I would love to see you there and chat, chat about your same challenges and how Vega can help. Thank you.
