summary: "In this session, a Slack representative demonstrates how the platform has evolved from its roots as a simple messaging tool to a robust environment for **AI-powered development** and **Agent deployment**. The speaker emphasizes Slack's key advantage as an event-driven platform that provides an out-of-the-box UI and deep **context**—understanding user relationships, channel history, and permissions—which is critical for building effective agents that can operate alongside human teams. The 'Slack Platform' is presented not just as a collaboration tool, but as the interaction layer for the increasingly autonomous enterprise, capable of bridging the gap between legacy systems and modern AI solutions.

The presentation features two main demos. The first illustrates how teams can streamline workflows by integrating multiple agents like **GitHub Copilot**, **Cursor**, and **Claude** directly into Slack channels. By invoking these agents to perform tasks asynchronously—such as creating pull requests or answering repetitive questions via a **Channel Expert**—teams can reduce noise and maintain visibility. For instance, the 'Channel Expert' agent can ingest past conversations and documentation to automatically answer repetitive questions, freeing up human developers to focus on novel problems. The speaker highlights how agents can handle tasks like 'my expense report was rejected' by routing users to the correct policy documents, effectively handling 'tier 0' support within the chat interface. These agents coexist in channels, providing a unified interface where multiple specialized bots can be called upon as needed.

The second demo focuses on the **developer experience** of building these agents. The speaker showcases how Slack's **Socket Mode** and simple API surface make it ideal for 'vibe coding'—a rapid, iterative development style often assisted by AI coding tools. By using **Socket Mode**, developers can bypass the complex infrastructure setup of public endpoints and webhooks, allowing them to iterate safely behind corporate firewalls. Using **Cursor**, the host generates a fully functional agent in minutes from a single natural language prompt, highlighting the platform's speed and ease of use for prototyping. This approach allows developers to instantly test their agents in a secure environment. This 'zero to hello world' in minutes capability is positioned as a game-changer for rapid innovation and avoiding 'POC purgatory,' enabling teams to get tools into users' hands faster.

Furthermore, the session touches on the importance of **context and permissions**. Slack's architecture allows agents to act on behalf of specific users, inheriting their permissions and access levels. This ensures that an agent cannot expose sensitive data that the invoking user wouldn't otherwise have access to. The speaker concludes by encouraging developers to leverage Slack's new UI elements—like streaming responses, shimmer states, and 'thinking' indicators—to build modern, responsive AI experiences that feel native to the platform. By combining rich context, event-driven architecture, and a familiar chat interface, Slack aims to be the command center for the next generation of AI agents."

Hey, everyone. Thanks for coming. All right. For a couple of days. All right. So I want to do two things today. I want to talk about How you can take your AI assisted development and use Slack to supercharge that to streamline it. And I also wanna touch upon how you can use Slack to deploy agents and build AI. So, I'll try to go over some high-level topics when I can. I don't know, actually, who in this room uses Slack in the room in this box area that uses Slack? OK. Has anyone developed on Slack before? OK, 1 or 2. OK. OK. So I'll go over some like, I'll try to sneak into my high-level concepts. Um, all right. So Slack, the Slack platform came out maybe 8 to 10 years ago, and at its core, it's basically an event-driven platform, right? Just like Slack, the products. So back then, we called them bots, right? Bots were just basically non-human actors within the Slack workspace, and now we call them agents, which are bots with LLMs attached. But the technology and the architecture is almost exactly the same. So the past few years, we've found a really good match with the development that's been happening. So, it's really a kind of a natural match of Slack and it's seen a lot of explosions. So, I wanna focus on the far right here. I'm not gonna talk about Slack usage. I'm gonna really focus on developer conference. So we'll focus on AI specifically and what we're doing within Slack, you know. So, every company is complex, you know, there's no one silver bullet, one solution that works, you know, you companies make acquisitions, they have employees build things and leave. Um, you're working, there's always a blend of solutions. So our approach to AI is trying to support all of that, you know, whether it's out of the box, whether it's something that you, you've had running on your servers for 10 years, whether it's a partner that you chose to work with. So, we try to build in a way and give you the tools to be able to serve all those things. Because really, I'm sure all the businesses you work for use all that. So, I would say our biggest advantage is the UI. So when you're developing AI you should be focused on what? The new technology. Uh, the business value, the solution. Slack gives you an out of the box UI you don't have to worry about. Um, we've been through some new things this year. So, have you, have you seen work objects? Uh, we, we're having some new multimodal stuff that's coming out. And then probably one of the most popular aspects of working in Slack and building AI is context, right? So to have a good agent, what you need is who's talking to who, what are the relationships, how do people relate to each other, channels relate to each other, objects relate to each other. What happened last week and also what happened in the last 5 minutes. So, oftentimes though, that's what it takes to have a good contextual agent that actually makes sense, that actually serves a purpose. So, we give that to you through a set of APIs where you can call in real time. You can call on behalf of the user as well. So, when you're launching agents in the Slack, you can understand what that user is allowed to see and only what that user is allowed to see, and then use that context for the agent. So, We, we also launched this year some automation. So like I mentioned, every company is different. Sometimes you don't want to build, right? So you just want to be able to do no code or configure. So, and that's the case, you can also automate that in Slack. And then, lastly, what we've been trying to do is take All these new UI elements you see around the internet on different AI products you use, and blend them into a Slack platform, but do it in a way that doesn't increase developer load. It doesn't, it doesn't take any like cognitive work to do. So we put in streaming, shimmer states, thinking strings, things like that, kind of naturally into a platform, but we've done it in ways that that allows you to develop very quickly. So, I wanna bring over, I wanna run a demo here, and what I wanna show you is How you can use some tools you might use today when you're developing with AI within Slack. All right, so I'm gonna talk through this. Well, this is Slack, if you haven't seen it. Um, what we have here is a payments channel. This is a group of developers working on a payments app, right? So, GitHub is in here. Um, in your Slack, you probably have many different apps and bots sending messages, so this may seem familiar to you. Um, but in addition to GitHub, what we also have is a co-pilot agent. So, launching agents in the Slack is essentially native. We've had the capability for a while, we've matured it, but it just comes out of the box functionality. So, in this example, let's say there's an issue, and I want to invoke an agent that's in this channel. So, what I'm gonna do is call up the GitHub co-pilot agent. From this action fail. And just call it like I'm calling another human, right? There's actually 6 different agents in this channel, um, but I'm just gonna call GitHub co-pilot. And what it's gonna do is it's gonna take off. It's gonna say, all right, I have a job to do. I'm gonna do it. Um, you might see some emojis being used. So I think it'll say, yup, I have some eyes, I'm looking at this. So, I know there are 8 people in this channel. Your channels may have 1000, you may have 5. But typically, you want everyone in the channel to understand that something's happening and I don't have to do anything. And then the one person being able to do that thing, right? That's probably the most efficient way to work. So, what Co-Pilott will do is automatically let your team know, yup, this is being looked at, being taken care of. We've went ahead and created a PR, um, you can look at the web as well, and then it'll use some of our new UI elements to just update the progress along the way, which is pretty cool. So, Um, if you use co-pilot before or, you know, cursor, codex, this will look very familiar to you. You can see your running agents. So, we always try to give you the ability to delink exactly where you need to go, in case you want to go do some deep, deep work outside of Slack, right? Cause sometimes that's the best place to do it. So if you really wanna see what, if there's different processes running, you can go ahead and delink there. And then this PR essentially will just be updated over time. I think overall, it's gonna do maybe 3 commits. Um, and then co-pilot will just do his thing. Again, we'll de-link for the people that need to go out. And the best part of bringing the AI development into Slack is it's becoming more and more asynchronous, right? No one wants to sit there and stare at their computer and, and, and watch it work. So when you're in Slack, it'll just give you a notification when it's done, right? If you wanna go check, you can see what it's doing, great. Or you can go about your day and your little activity monitor will pop up when it's done. Uh, I want to point out a couple of other things. So in this one channel, we also, I think we have 6 agents total. Uh, we have some other agents here. We have Claude, Codex, Cursor. Um, does anyone use Cursor? That's right. Anyone? Oh, that guy does. Anyone use, uh, Codex? Or Claude. OK, OK. All right, so me and Mosa and Claude. So all these agents are in that channel as well, and you can call them in the exact same way. So. Um, that's an interesting distribution though. In addition to that, we have some out of the box agents. So oftentimes, if you don't wanna build, you just wanna use Salesforce agents. We have that, we have those as well, and those are gonna be under the agents tab. And what those are really useful for is saving your, your team time. So, Channel Expert is one that we came out with earlier this year. You know, I'm sure everyone in this room's had channels where people drop in and ask questions. Maybe they're good questions, maybe they're bad questions, but they're definitely distracting questions, right? So what the channel expert does is it automatically looks back for the channel, also looks at any resources that you choose to give it access to, you can just click and add to it, and it'll go ahead and try to answer those questions. So, it's great for people that aren't on your team. Maybe it's great for you if you came back from vacation, you're like, all right, what happened? Or maybe there's like, oh, does this issue happen before? It's just a little value add. Um, I use it in all my channels. It's great. Um, if someone asks something, there's a very good chance that they can, they can get that answer through those resources or the past 500,000 messages or pings that came into that channel. So that's cool. And the employee agent's a fun one too. Because, you know, this is, this, this channel is called Payment PR. Every once in a while, you might get someone pop in and be like, oh, my reinvent expense was rejected, which obviously development team would not support that. So this agent would kick in and be like, all right, no, no, here are the company resources. Like you want to go here to ask accounting about this. So, yeah, having all those within, I mean, maybe you wouldn't have 6 within one channel. This is obviously for demonstration purposes, but you can, and they can live there in harmony. So, looking over here, We have the plan. So, the, uh, agents saying, you know, this is what I'm gonna do, this is how I'm doing it, and I'll update you along the way. Um, at the end, it'll clean all this up actually, so it'll just have a nice message. Um, there's, it is in progress. I think it's, OK, so it's done. And what you can do, you can also open up a VS code. So really, the whole goal is to let the people find what they need to find, let everyone else know things are happening, cut down the communication. OK, so we're back here. Obviously, this is an extremely simple solve. Um, this isn't a, a really complex gentic solution, but it did solve it. Um, it created a PR, um, I went there. So, if I close here and I go over to the actual PR, the other thing that happens is I might be over here, I might be reviewing it, maybe it takes 5 minutes, maybe it takes 2 weeks. Um, but because that agent is over in the channel. Whatever I do in here, it's automatically gonna reflect, so my other teammates can see. What's interesting about that is it also shows up in search, right? So, for incidents that pop up when you're using Slack Search, you're searching in Slackbot, all of this data will now pop up, like, oh, that incident actually resolve resolve resolved. That just happens automatically for everyone in the company, which I think is really interesting. So, not best practices, no comment, merge, obviously not the best thing to do, but you can see it actually keeps it updated. You can see the history of the issue and then actually the resolution. Um. So, pretty interesting. All right, I think that's done. Let me pop over here. All right. So I showed you a couple. Um, we launched probably 100s this year. Um, Slack platform is always free. There's no, you can just install apps, you don't have to worry about it. Um, if you're paying these companies, we wanna make sure you get the most value out of that. So, if you go over to the Slack marketplace, you can click to install, um, and add them to Slack. So, I encourage you to check that out after this. OK. So shifting more to, say, from AI assisted development to actually building agents in Slack. So, this is good because I, I think most of you hadn't built on Slack before. So what is a Slack app? Like I said before, Slack is, it's an, it's an event-based platform, right? Essentially, an app is something that sits over here, receives events, and sends events back. I mean, it's not something you can figure on Slack. So, we, you know, we're language agnostic. Uh, I do wanna call it one really cool thing though, which helps getting some, takes zero from uh, from zero to low world from like hours to minutes. Um, and that's the ability to use webSockets. So, when you launch, um, a local Slack app, you can use our CLI, you many of you probably use Vibe code now or AI assist code, that works well too. Um, you can actually run it in socket mode, so you don't have to worry about setting up an endpoint, you don't have to worry about getting approval to set up this static endpoint for events to go to. You can actually run it right away within seconds and have that work in Slack. In that scenario, hopefully you're starting in a sandbox, but then when you go to production, you have the option to keep it in socket mode or set up a static endpoint. So you always have that option, and when you're building for a company, it's a really nice option to have. I don't know if anyone's ever been in those arguments trying to open up an endpoint before, but it can kill a project extremely quickly. Um. Let's talk about it. So, there's a couple of concepts in Slack with OAth, I guess they're not that unique, but when you, when you install a Slack app, we have the bot or the agent. Um, then we also have the ability to Authenticate each individual user, which is more and more popular these days. So, I mentioned earlier how you can get the context for that user. You can take actions on behalf of that user. You can search, you can understand who they talk to, what they talk about, how things relate in their life within Slack. You can pull all that in through our APIs, and we, it's just a simple, simple OO. You, you can get that through the user. So that's a really important topic as well. All right, let me come back over here. And I thought about showing you, I don't know, some complex ways to build and getting deeper, but frankly, like, if I was gonna build on Slack and I was gonna launch an agent, this is what I would probably do, so I just thought I'd show you the simplest possible way. So This is Cursor. If you use Cursor, you'd recognize it. But basically, In the past 10 years, Slack, we've made a lot of hard choices, right? It's incredibly simple to make a complex platform. You just say yes to everything. Like, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. You have this incredibly complex platform. It takes you 18 months to learn to configure. You need a PhD to even like enter this space. We've always taken the opposite approach. Like, no, we want to be simple, straightforward, easy to use. We want you to be able to, to build an app in less than 1 hour. We want to be quick. Um, and it's paying dividends now, cause it, it lend itself very, very, very well to AI assist or vibe coding. So when you plug in your tools against Slack, I mean, this is, this is using, um, a simple one paragraph, maybe two-sentence prompt saying, build me an assistant-like agent using public Slack docs and go nuts. You know, it's searching the web, there's a couple of tools, but I'm just kind of letting it run. And it's obviously running it fast forward, but I think when I recorded it, it took 67 minutes. Um, and at the end, you get a fully functioning Slack app with one paragraph. So, I mean, that's the, probably the biggest advantage of our platform is just that simplicity, right? The ability to just try it out. Cause when you're building, I mean, I don't know how many of you people in this room have built something that is in POC purgatory. Probably everyone. I have, like most of my stuff is in POC purgatory, I would say. So, I mean, really the advantage to this quick approach is you get in the user's hands, right? Something might seem incredible in your mind and, you know, it might be like, you, you think you're like carrying everything, but you get in the user's hands like, yeah, that, that's not that sweet. So being able to actually launch and test quickly is critical, right? You might, you might fail 99 times out of 100 when we're in, when we're on like the frontier of building agents, trying new solutions. So being able to actually do it this quickly and launch, I think it's critical. Um, I mean, the one thing I would always, I always caution against is spending 6 months with a plan, building big architecture because everything changed since then, right? Just get it in someone's hands, start testing. Um, yeah, so I just gave it that one prompt, and that is an installable Slack app. You could run that by run and socket mode, and it's in your Slack workspace. Um, you don't have to do anything else. So, Back over here. OK. All right, so. I wanna open up to some questions. What do you, questions about Slack, about AI, about agents, about tools you use, anything, anything I've talked about. What do you, anyone got anything? No? All right. No one? OK. OK, well, check us out over 840. I don't, it's that way. It's like, if you see, actually, if you see Red Hat, it's past that. So if you wanna come by, we, we can show you how to build, talk through solutions, work with you on whatever. Yeah, thank you.
