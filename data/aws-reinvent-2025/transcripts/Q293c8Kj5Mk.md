Good afternoon everybody. Welcome to uh reinvent Day One. How's everybody feeling so far? Great. Awesome, awesome. Well, thank you for coming and joining us this afternoon to our session. Um, let's just start with a couple of questions here. So, how many of you by the show of hands, uh, in the room, they are either thinking of modernizing your SAP, uh, environment or have already kind of started that journey? Yeah, that's a few here, couple here, awesome. And then what about, uh, you know, your non-SAP workload? Have anybody started looking to migrating to cloud as well? Yeah. Perfect. Perfect. So, um, my name is Shafli, and I'm the senior solutions architect manager, and, uh, today we also have two gentlemen here, Hajo Kaura, a senior solution architect, uh, and then we also have, uh, Noah Parker, solution architect. So we're going to talk today about how to build your secure foundation that you need for the migration of your SAP rise and non-SAP workload. OK, and this is part of the NTA 318 session that we have here. So at the end of the, the session today, you're going to learn about how to set up your AWS cloud foundations, and we're going to talk and discuss topics such as migration strategies. What do you need to consider when it comes to resiliency and your disaster recovery? We're also going to talk a little bit about what about your network connection options coming into AWS. And what do you need to do? To have a secure environment for your workloads. So, customer with on-prem SAP environment. Have to deal with multiple commercial constructs. And you also have to deal with multiple support contracts, and each of these support contracts have their respective SLA. And customers also have to deal with undifferentiated heavy lifting. Of the infrastructure management. So As customers looked into SAP rise. Compared to the on-prem deployment of SAP. Rice is basically represents a simple commercial construct. So what is rice? RICE with SAP on AWS stands for a comprehensive Business Transformation offering. That brings together. SAPS for HANA private cloud. AWS infrastructure. And The managed services into a single solution. So, think of it really as a SAP cloud platform delivered as a managed service. So as customer look into moving to SAP rise. It comes with infrastructure management. Software support And also technical manage service. Essentially, what this does is allow customers to shift valuable resources. Away from the traditional infrastructure management and the health and caring and feeding. To those resources into what's truly important for the business. And that also allows the customers to Look into business innovation with those resources. Now, working with thousands of customers like yourself. We are seeing customers dealing with a wide variety of challenges. Customers are looking for solutions to better your business. And you could be strategizing on. How do you transform your business to stay competitive in today's market? Maybe you're looking to enhance your customer service. Right? Or maybe you're looking to optimize your supply chain. Or maybe you want to become a data-driven organization. So customers could also be dealing with compelling events, such as cost-cutting objectives. Maybe uh data exit, data center exit or consolidation. Workloads or system consolidation because of mergers and acquisition in your business? Maybe you're dealing with end of life support that's coming up for either hardware or software. Or maybe you're simply looking for ways to be innovative and innovate with services like Gen AI. So regardless of what those drivers might be. Modernizing a mission-critical workload like SAP on the in the cloud will allow you to address these business challenges. And also make these transformative improvements within your business. Now, let's uh talk about cloud migration strategy here. So when you look into the cloud migration strategy. There are really a few areas you need to consider. First is what will be your migration strategy from your on-prem and SAP environment into RICE, and this will be an SAP managed AWS environment. The next one you want to think about. Would be, what about your non-SAP workload? What about your mission critical non-SAP workload but have dependencies on SAP? Now you need to have a migration strategy for those workload and those who will be looking into migrating to AWS in a customers managed environment. So Hazhou will, will talk about the consideration of those two and when it comes to things like connectivity and stuff like that. So, with those non-SAP workload migration, There are additional things you want to consider the 7 R's of migration strategies. And these will be rehost, relocate, re-platform, refactor, repurchase. Maybe retain or even retire. So I'm going to give you a little bit of an example of what I mean by all those, uh, the seven R's. Your on-prem SAP ECC environment. You need to transform to rise. Your CRM, your EWM components. Doesn't need to be replaced with S4. Your BW or not Hannah. Those you need to repurchase with Data sphere. So within your environment, you might have. Vertex, PLM. Those, you might need to either re-host or refactor onto AWS native services. I'm pretty sure in your environment you probably would have some sort of a custom application within your environment. Those you need to either consider to either retained or maybe even retire as part of the journey. So those will be the things that you wanna consider when it comes to thinking about your cloud migration strategy for your SAP. And non-SAP workload. Mondelez International is a food and beverage company in the US. They have went through a very similar journey as well. So with them, they had to deal with fragmented SAP infrastructure environment. They were dealing with over 80 production SAPIDs. And Mondelez, what they did was they chose to go rise with SAP on AWS. Because they believe AWS provide the most secure and reliable cloud platform for their mission critical SAP workload. And this is also in alignment with their migration strategy of their non-SAP mission critical workload onto AWS as well. So as a result of that migration of that journey. Mondelez International were able to achieve consistent operational support. And they were able to run the workload with best in class security, resiliency and reliability. Sean Tibor, the director of global cloud engineering at uh Mondelezuz. By leveraging AWS. Yeah, allow them to achieve greater security, agility, and reliability for their operations. Now, let's, next, let's look into what do you need to do to build a strong AWS cloud foundation for your migration. Having a strong ALS cloud foundation is critical to the long-term success of your environment achieving security, reliability, and resiliency. So let's take a closer look at that. One thing we do see that's very common for a customer that's coming or familiar with on-prem environment. Customers typically will start with 3 large AWS accounts. And this will be a death. A staging And a production account. Now, this approach. Over time and very quickly. are going to be running into complication. In a sense of, as customers start launching more workload into these 3 accounts or giving more and more teams access to these environments. It becomes harder and harder for. Customer to really isolate the workloads. And customers will run into challenges such as very complex IAM policies. You're also going to maybe run into IP exhaustion. And the separation between billings between the accounts or teams. It's, it's going to be a big challenge for them. So, with this approach, there's also no environments where customers could give access to the developer environment where they could experiment. Without running into the risk of potential impacting a workload or maybe a project. So What we suggest would be. As a best practice to create an AWS account, one account for each team. And that way is essentially allow customers to create. An absolute blast radius in terms of impact from a security and billing perspective. Now, let's take a look at how we start by doing that. First, we're gonna solve the AWS account. This will be the foundational container where your AWS services and resources will reside. On top of that, We're gonna have the AWS control tower. AW control tower provides the initial multi-account structure for the landing zone. It will also create and deploy an account factory that allows you to quickly create AWS accounts. It will configugure the initial organizational structure unit for the environment. As well as it will configure preventative and detective guard rails for your environment. AWS control tower enabled agility and governance for your environment. By bringing things like landing zone. And landing zone is your best practices and lessons learned for your environment. It will also help to centralize identity and access logging. And this is very crucial as you accelerate and grow in your environment. It will automate the compliant account provisioning. As well as establishing controls for your workloads. And this will be maybe a preventative control, maybe a detective control, or a proactive control. For some of you, you might be in a regulated industry. Where you might need help with establishing some of these controls in your environment. So don't worry, we do have teams within AOS that we can come and help to establish all these controls as well. So as customers start looking to leverage infrastructure as code and to execute faster. It is crucial to making sure that teams are being compliant as they execute and move faster in the environment. Now, In addition to control tower, what if customers that you need help with additional things? Maybe you want to integrate into additional AWS services like security services. Maybe you want to look into leveraging a DevOps pipeline that will allow you to do tighter. You know, configuration management. So with that, we do have the landing zone accelerator and AWS from our professional service team. So as you look into creating your landing zone or maybe writing code for a landing zone. Don't feel like you have to do this by yourself. There's actually a lot of helps that we have available. Obviously from our professional service team. You can also get guidance from our solution architects or maybe leverage one of our AWS partners as well to give you a hand. Now, for customer, they're looking for additional guidance for rise of SAP. We also provide step by step guidance on connectivity. And best practices for hybrid network design. We also do provide support for SAP specific security requirements. Now, with that, I'm gonna pass over to Harjo, where he's gonna cover the SAP rights architecture and integration. Hajo? Thank you. Let's explore architecture and integration patterns that connect SAPrise environment on AWS with broader enterprise infrastructure. Getting connectivity right is fundamental to a successful implementation. AWS provides 4 primary connectivity options for SAP rise environment. Each optimized for different requirements. Starting with AWS Direct Connect. It provides consistent network performance. With dedicated bandwidth at low latency. You can choose a dedicated connection from 1, 10, 100, or 400 gigabits per second. That supports multiple virtual interfaces. Or you can also choose from an AWS Partner hosted connection. Ranging from 50 Mbps up to 25 gigabits per second. With over 130+ AWS Direct Connect locations globally. You can design redundant connections for high availability. Moving to AWS site to site VPN. It's a cost-effective, quick to deploy connectivity option for SAPI environment. Traffic is inspected using IPsec. With bandwidths now up to 5 gigabits per second per VPN tunnel. Additionally, you can combine this option with AWS Direct Connect for redundant connectivity. For customers with existing AWS landing zones, AWS Transit Gateway provides the scalability you need. And it comes with several key advantages. You can combine or aggregate multiple VPN tunnels for higher throughput using ECMP. It supports up to 5000 routes advertised through Customer Gateway, which is significantly more than virtual Private gateway. Migration from AWS VPN gateway to AWS Transit gateway is straightforward. And it fully supports both IPV 4 and IPV6 traffic. Finally, Internet connectivity, for external users and mobile access. You can inspect Incoming connections, using AWS web application firewall. And additionally, you can route incoming traffic to SAP web dispatcher using AWS application load balancer. And the traffic is encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher. Let's dive deep into AWS Direct Connect. We start with on-premise corporate data center. In this architecture, We have two sites, Site A and Site B. Representing office locations where users or workloads are located. From here, we connect to AWS Direct Connect locations. Now these are physical sites. Where customers' network equipment connects with AWS network equipment. Now notice, we have two separate AWS site Direct Connect sites here. This dual site architecture is a best practice as it provides redundancy in case one site faces any issues, the traffic can be routed from the other. From here We are in the AWS cloud environment, using AWS global backbone network. In this architecture, We have a single AWS region, with two separate AWS accounts. Each with distinct purpose. The first is customer managed AWS account. This is where your non SAP non rise workloads are hosted. Now this could be your cloud applications, your IoT applications, data lakes, or any other analytics applications. This account also has an AWS Transit gateway, which acts as a central connectivity hub. Connecting multiple VPCs with on-premise corporate network. The other is SAP managed AWS account. Now this is where your rise environment lives. The AWS Transit gateway. In the customer managed AWS account. Connects to the SAP RS VPC in this SAP managed AWS account and also integrates with on-premise corporate network. The AWS Transit Gateway VPC attachment. To the SAP managed AWS account. Delivers predictable performance. With dedicated bandwidth. Which is important for your mission critical SAP landscape while maintaining clear separation across your hybrid environment. But there is more to this architecture. Notice the connectivity from SAP rise environment. To 3rd party SAS applications. SAPBTP and other external integration. These connections leverage AWS global network, which means low latency, high bandwidth, secure connectivity. Without traversing over public internet for most of the journey. This architecture is important. As it shows how your SAP rise environment connects across your hybrid enterprise landscape. Let's take a look at AWS site to site VPN. We have on-premise corporate locations. And a customer gateway, which represents firewall or router through which. We established 2 secure IPsec tunnels to AWS cloud environment. Now these two IPsec tunnels. Use 256 bit AES encryption, which ensures Secure connectivity over public internet. The VPN terminates at AWS Transit gateway in the Customer managed AWS account. Which then further connects. With SAP Rice VPC in the SAP managed AWS account. Similar to direct connect pattern. This architecture also leverages. AWS Global Network for External Connectivity. Choosing the right connectivity option. Depends upon your existing network architecture. Your existing infrastructure, or any specific requirements you might have. AWS has a decision tree. That guides you through key concentrations while selecting the right connectivity option. Let's take a look at the decision tree. Start by evaluating. Whether You have existing AWS infrastructure or account. Or any other applications running on AWS or you plan to modernize your SAP landscape on AWS in the future. For organizations without existing AWS infrastructure that can connect directly to SAP Rice VPC. On this path You need to decide Whether you need a dedicated connection or not. If you do not need a dedicated connection, And your bandwidth requirements exceeds beyond 1.25 gigabits per second. AWS side to side VPN with ECMP. Provides the scalability you need. Otherwise, you can go ahead with AWS site to site VPN for cost-effective, secure connectivity. If you do need a dedicated line. And also require encryption. Then, VPN over AWS Direct Connect is the optimal choice. Otherwise, AWS Direct Connect can be used to connect to any AWS regions directly. Now let's take a look at the other half. If you're planning for broader AWS adoption, then AWS Transit gateway-based solutions are the right choice, and they provide the scalability you might need. Now, on this path, the first thing you need to decide is whether you're going to go ahead with more than one VPCs in your AWS account. For single VPC scenarios. AWS Transit gateway in the customer managed AWS account can be used in the same AWS region where Rse Environment is also deployed. For multi-account scenarios. Or multi-account VPC scenarios. You can, you need to decide whether. You require SAP to provide AWS Transit gateway in the rise region for cross-region connectivity to your AWS cloud environment. Now if that's the case, then SAP provides the transit gateway, otherwise, you can go ahead with AWS landing zone implementation. And use AWS Transit gateway in your customer manage account and connect to the RS environment. Now I know It looks Complex at first glance, and you might be thinking, how do I decide which path is right for my organizations? The good news is, you don't have to navigate this alone. AWS has specialist network and SAP solution architects. Who work with SAP Rice customers every day, and they'll guide you on the decision tree, based on your requirements. Which could be your existing network architecture, your bandwidth requirements, any security considerations, or any future growth plans you might have. Let's take a look at operating model for SAP rise on AWS. This model Defines key responsibilities across critical parties in the rise ecosystem. As we know, SAP rise in a fully managed landscape, and this stack defines exactly who manages what. Right at the bottom from the AWS infrastructure, all the way up to the business applications at the top. Now at the top, we have customers and partner responsible for application. There. This includes application and change management. Any functional support, SAP basis application support. The green layer represents the connectivity. That's a shared responsibility between SAP and the customer. Further down We have SAP responsible for application, landscape and hosting. This includes operating system and database maintenance, SAP bases infrastructure support, backup management. And at the bottom, We have AWS responsible for resilience of the cloud. That includes physical infrastructure, the hardware maintenance, and the data centers. Let me show you how this model aligns with AWS shared security and responsibility model. Which forms the foundations of compliance and security. AWS is responsible for security and resilience of the cloud. This means we do the undifferentiated heavy lifting of the physical infrastructure. That includes the compute, storage, networking. AWS regions, AWS availability zones, and the locations. All the services that form up the AWS Cloud. SAP and the customer are responsible for resilience and security in the cloud. That includes identity access and configuration management, data, and any functional support. SAP Rice SI partner are responsible for migration of SAP applications into the rise environment. With this clear. Demarcation of responsibilities and roles. Everyone is aware of the responsibilities which helps to ensure critical migration paths and journeys. Now, with connectivity established. Operating model clear, let's take a look at AWS resilience capabilities for SAP Rice environment. AWS has extensive resilience capabilities for SAP Rise and BTP customers. We provide highly secure private network, interconnecting SAPRS, BTP, AWS, and third party services. With SAP rise available across multiple AWS regions globally. We offered broad geographic footprint. That helps our customers to meet their data residency and data sovereignty requirements. Both long distance DR and short distance DR options are available for our customers. Which helps them To take Resilience, strategies into picture. With low latency, high performance network between Ryse and BTP. We offer optimal integration performance. Let's now take a look at some of the backup capabilities. SAP on AWS uses encrypted Amazon EBS volumes and backups by default. AWS backend agent for SAP HANA delivers automated backups. With comprehensive backup retention and compliance capabilities to meet regulatory requirements. AWS Life cycle management helps to ensure storage optimization while maintaining data protection integrity. For your broader enterprise environment beyond SAP rise. AWS backup service provides centralized data protection capabilities. It's a fully managed service. That includes centralized backup management. Data retention And compliance monitoring capabilities. Key features include ransomware recovery with logically air gapped walls. Integration with AWSKMS for encryption. And cross-count management using AWS organizations. Additionally, you can use AWS Backup Audit Manager that helps. To audit and monitor your data protection activities to meet your compliance requirements. Now, we know that backups are essential, but they are just one part of a comprehensive disaster recovery strategy. Let's take a look at disaster recovery patterns for SAP rise the Environment on AWS. SAP rise on AWS supports two disaster recovery patterns. The first is short distance DR. It uses synchronous replication between primary and secondary applications. Within same AWS region but across separate availability zones. It uses synchronous replication. To provide 0 RPO, which means zero data loss for your mission critical SAP landscape. The other is long distance DR. It uses asynchronous replication between primary and secondary systems across separate AWS regions. But importantly, you can deploy your application servers. Across separate availability zones in this primary AWS region for regional resilience capabilities. This option provides RPO in minutes. While Balancing between data protection. And regional disaster recovery capabilities. For your broader application landscape, AWS Elastic disaster recovery supports multiple deployment patterns. Now, it could be from on-premise to AWS within AWS regions, within AWS availability zones, or from other platforms to AWS. AWS Elastic Disaster recovery. Minimizes downtime and data loss. While using continuous block level replication. It uses A staging area for storage with minimal compute. And provides point in time recovery. From which you can launch recovery instances on AWS within minutes. In this architecture, We have source servers on which AWS Elastic disaster recovery replication agents are deployed. Continuously replicating at the block level to a staging area in another region. Now this connectivity. is over a secure channel. Enterprise disaster recovery often requires Multi-account architecture. This architecture shows how AWS elastic disaster recovery. Supports recovery across multiple AWS accounts. You can have replication into a staging area in an account, but have recovery into a completely different AWS account. This could be based on your requirements and needs, which could be an actual production recovery. An isolated Dia drill. Or a recovery for only investigation and audit purpose. This account level isolation ensures data protection and multi-account support. Now let us take a look at security capabilities that help to ensure your SAP rise environment is fully protected, along with enterprise landscape. At this point, I'll request Noah to continue the session. No. Thanks very much. Security is the foundation of everything we do at AWS. It's not just a feature, it's built into our DNA. Our core infrastructure satisfies the security requirements for military operations, global banks, and other high sensitivity organizations. This means that you get the same enterprise grade security whether you're a startup or a Fortune 500 company. Using Rise with SAP on AWS, you'll be able to leverage the security benefits of nitro-based EC2 instances. Traditionally, the hypervisor protects the physical hardware and bios while also virtualizing the CPU storage and networking. With the nitro system, these functions are fragmented into independent purpose-built processor units known as nitrocars. Nitrocards offload these tasks to dedicated hardware and software and in doing so, reduce costs, provide performance benefits, and increase the security and isolation of virtualized resources. By design, the nitro system has no operator access. There's no mechanism for any system or person to log into an EC2 nitro host and access the memory or access any customer data on local or remote volumes. On top of this, every boot sequence is cryptographically validated and updates can be applied without interrupting what's most important to you and your customers. Using rides with SAP on AWS. Your SAP and non-SAP accounts will be separated with data in all accounts secured. In your rise with SAP account, encryption at rest is the default for data stored in file, block or object storage. Additionally, you'll be equipped with immutable backups powered by Amazon S3. In transit, data is encrypted using mutual TLS encryption, which offers enhanced authentication and security for network communications versus traditional TLS. This offers enhanced protection for your sensitive workloads and applications. Additionally, SAP offers Firewall as a service. Enabling you to inspect traffic between subnets and tiers in your rise environment. And with options for both short and long-range disaster recovery, you'll be capable of choosing the strategy which works best for you and your organization. In your non-SAP accounts, you could take advantage of our managed security offerings and let us handle the undifferentiated heavy lifting. For encryption at rest, AWS Key Management Service enables you to create, control, and manage encryption keys securely at scale to protect data across all of your applications and workloads and maintain regulatory compliance, all while maintaining complete control over who accesses your keys and when. In transit, AWS Cloudfront enables you to provide secure content delivery to your users closer to them. With encryption between users, edge locations, and origins. With AWS network firewall, you can perform deep packet inspection, filtering, and monitoring across all of your networks at scale, allowing you to focus on managing threats instead of managing infrastructure. And using AWS web application firewall, you'll be able to mitigate malicious bots and actors in real time. For all of these offerings, AWS provides multiple security sorry, connectivity options to connect to your existing infrastructure, providing speed redundancy regardless of where your data is coming from. With new connectivity comes new security challenges. Inspecting north-south traffic is critical to ensure your data is protected and your resources remain safe from malicious injection attacks. But misconfigurations can lead to sensitive data being compromised in east-west traffic flows as well. In traditional on-premises deployments, firewalls are positioned at the network perimeter for north-south inspection and internally for east-west inspection. AWS Gateway load balancer facilitates both of these inspection models using endpoints powered by AWS Private Link. Using these endpoints, you can provide a centralized inspection service for all lines of business and enforce an organization-wide security posture. This is done as a bump in the wire solution, meaning that traffic is transparently intercepted without any modifications to the original source or destination. By configuring AWS Gateway load bouncer as the entry and exit points for internet traffic, north-south traffic flows can be inspected seamlessly at scale. For east-west traffic, an inspection VPC using gateway load bouncer endpoints can inspect and secure all inter-VPC communications for both rise and non-RS resources. And for securing these networks on AWS, you can also take advantage of open-source solutions you've come to trust, third-party providers with state of the art network firewalls and appliances, your own hardware on-premises, or security services provided natively by AWS. In your rise with SAP account, AWS network firewall acts as the first line of defense for your traffic, filtering and inspecting all network traffic to and from Rise resources. AWS Macy discovers and protects sensitive SAP data by using machine learning and pattern matching to automatically identify sensitive data such as personally identifiable information and financial data in your S3 buckets, reducing your risk and helping ensure compliance. And at the heart of SAP's secure by default framework sits Amazon guard duty, which continuously monitors AWS environments for malicious or unauthorized activities. Amazon guard duty utilizes machine learning to deliver real-time threat detection across your workloads in AWS. And all Amazon guard duty findings are centralized in an S3 bucket providing a central repository for security logs across all environments in your organization. And if you've got your networks protected by a third-party provider, there's a good chance we've partnered with them to help you remain protected in the same way you've come to know in a seamless way on AWS. Here you can see all of the network firewalls which work natively with our AWS Gateway load balancer, allowing you to take advantage of the same security and scalability we built into our own network firewall service. But security isn't just about prevention. It's about visibility and control. Let me show you how you can integrate security incident and event management systems at AWS. Today, teams juggle multiple security tools, each with their own interface and workflow. Our unified platform approach brings everything together in one place, eliminating tool sprawl and reducing your operational complexity. Where teams previously spent hours manually analyzing connections between security signals, we can now automatically correlate signals across threat detection, vulnerabilities, and security findings. This surfaces critical relationships that might otherwise go unnoticed. Instead of security findings in isolation, we can provide enriched context about business impact and risk levels, helping teams understand which issues truly matter to their organization. Rather than spending time determining how to respond, we enable automated response workflows to address critical issues faster and more efficiently. Let me show you how AWS Security Hub delivers on these transformations. Using AWS Security Hub, your threats and vulnerabilities, controls and configurations, and sensitive data are unified in a single pane of glass. This allows you to prioritize those risks which truly matter rather than missing them or spending time sifting through siloed dashboards and logs. Over time, this enables you to monitor trends related to security, helping you understand if your controls are effective at an organizational level. And with resource visibility unified in one place, your teams can respond quickly at scale across all of your environments. AWS Security Hub uses the open cybersecurity scheme of framework. This enables seamless integration with third-party partners and tools. By reducing the need for data normalization, this allows you to focus on what's important to your organization's security posture. By bringing all of your data and events into one place, you can connect with other tools or native AWS services to supercharge your triage and response protocols. And with the flexibility to choose between all these options for your rise and non-rise workloads, you could build a central hub for connecting and securing your resources, both on-premises and in AWS. Using rides with SAP on AWS logs from your SAP and non-SAP workloads are centrally pulled in your security account, where Amazon guard duty continuously monitors and inspects for malicious or unauthorized activity. Guard duty monitors AWS cloud trail for suspicious API activity across your accounts to detect unauthorized deployments or access attempts to your resources. Using BPC flow logs and DNS logs from Amazon Route 53, guard duty analyzes network traffic to detect unexpected patterns, data exfiltration attempts, or unauthorized access using known malicious IP addresses or domains. And with the power of guard duty and AWS step functions, you can inspect, analyze, and automatically act on firewall logs from AWS or a third party provider, allowing you to block traffic to or from suspicious hosts at a moment's notice. For RS with SAP on AWS, this means early detection of intrusion attempts into your RS resources, adherence to requirements via compliance validation, and automated incident notifications, response, and remediation using AWS Lambda and AWS security hub. Through Project Unify, CSL is experiencing the power of Rise with SAP on AWS using a three-phase approach. First, they conducted a thorough evaluation of their existing SAP infrastructure and identified 3 distinct SAP instances siloed and disconnected. Together, CSL and AWS performed a lift and shift of existing applications to rise with SAP. Enabling increased agility, flexibility, and reduced TCO. For phase two, CSL has plotted a course for change with SAP Signnavia running exclusively on AWS. Through a modernization powered by SAPBTP services. CSL will be able to unlock new insights and data lakes and accelerate developer innovation using generative AI. For the 3rd phase, AWS is helping CSL reimagine their business entirely. Through this partnership, AWS and CSL have built a roadmap including automated document processing and ML powered forecasting using Amazon Sage Maker. CSL has already been able to address its inconsistent data standards and fragmented governance. But this is only the beginning. Mark Hill, the chief digital information officer at CSL, stated, we took a step back and decided how we wanted to reinvent CSL. Our goal was to create a robust environment that fosters innovation while keeping things simple, cost-effective, and productive. Through rise with SAP and AWS, CSL is able to do just that, all without managing any underlying infrastructure.
