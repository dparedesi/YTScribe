Welcome Welcome. I hope Reinvent is treating you well. So I'm gonna ask you a question. I'm gonna start this with a question to you and please raise your hands. If your production data were compromised tonight by a ransomware, could you prove recovery? Raise your hand. OK, 123. OK, I see some of you have a mechanism in place. I'm glad. In a cyber event. There is no warning. One moment everything is working fine. And then the moment after logs disappears. Data are not accessible anymore. Authentication doesn't work. You can't even send an email sometimes. And you know who's still at first? Your customers. Your users, the one you deliver the value of your company to. So social media starts creeping up, latency as well, and then executives feel it. And then you're left to wonder with your team and ask. Yourself the only question that you wouldn't want to ask. And we're online What's going on? Can we deliver Can we reach the public endpoint? Are we prepared? Can we recover from this? My name is Christian Critelli. I'm the EMIA lead for networking and resilience, and I'm here with Michael today. Hello, I'm Michael. Nice to meet you. It's a pleasure to have the next 55 minutes together. And today we're here to make sure that when something happens. Your organization can survive, can continue to operate, can stand still and continue to offer the value to your customers. Now let's define what a ransomware is. I'm gonna ask you another question. Who's familiar with the term SBD? One. OK. SBD silent but deadly. It's like a ransomware, right? When you feel it in the air, it's too late. It's in your system. And we want to avoid that, right? We don't want you to be unprepared. We want you to be prepared and brace for failure, right? So let's explore another interesting quote that I really like slash your defense cybersecurity spending. Immediately and uh redirect to resilience initiative. What I like the most is the little quote there Carney Maverick, you will be hacked, so embrace the breach. Now don't panic, you won't be hacked. What I like to deliver as a message here is that. You should be bracing for failure all the time. You should be prepared for recovery. You should be continuing and operating, knowing that at some point, like Doctor Virgen Vogel, Amazon CTO said. Eventually everything will fail. So you should consider that eventually everything will fail, so you will be prepared. To withstand To be resilient when it comes to data, when it comes to security, so the combination of protection. As well as preparation and recovery is what we call resilience initiatives. So yes. Spend your money in securities. It's very important, but also do not forget about resilience. Expand your view Today we're going to cover this. We're going to be talking about how to do this, how to be prepared, recover, protected. And how to make sure that you will withstand any service impairment, hopefully, and will continue to uh deliver your value because we want to turn panic into something predictable, unpredictability. And here is the Dilemma that I have and we have in the in the in the markets as well. Defender must be right 100% of the time if you think about it 100% of the time attacker only once. Now if you ask me that's unfair, right? It's unfair. Sometimes organizations don't even know that they have been breached until it's too late. Remember, silent but deadly. So You know, we want to change this, and we have frameworks in place. The National Institute of, uh, Standards and Technology called cyber resilience as the ability of anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to adverse conditions. Now I would like to point out that we should focus on those 4 words. Anticipate, we anticipate, we are learning, we are correlating our signals, our logs, and we troubleshoot, we understand, we learn, we observe, we have mechanisms in place to have observability, monitoring, alarming, self-healing, and we are prepared. We're not just sitting there and waiting for something to happen because then it's too late. We withstand. We're resilient. We have a layer of resiliency implemented in all of the different layers of our application from infrastructure to application level, right? Then we recover. We are able to recover and most importantly fast and also we adapt. We adapt because we learn. We test, we evaluate, and we learn, and we can adapt and maybe reestablish our RPO and RTO. Recovery point objective, recovery time objective. Who's familiar here with RPO RTO? I hope many of you, I see everyone, yes. So once we define that, we evaluate and then we can improve our resilience posture. So let's dive deep into some data now. 65%. Of the organization reported cyber attack in 2024, 65%, 90%. Of the cyber attacks involved an attempt. To hack the backup your data. Not just the data, even the backup, right, and almost 50% succeeded, and this trend is increasing year by year, 8 times. In the last few years. What does this tell us? Three things. First, ransom are surging. It's written there. Second, The backup are the targets, so we need to do something about it. Third, Company organizations are not prepared. They don't have data resilience in place. They don't have mechanisms to recover their backup. It's failing somehow. Now We had a glance to what ransomware attacks can do. What is the cost of downtime? What is it? 50,000,000 to 1 million, I repeat so that sinks in a little bit, 5,000,000 to 1 million. That's the cost, the average cost for a critical application for a Fortune 1000 company. And if you wonder how many times this happened, well, 3 out of 4 companies in the last 2 years have had an outage that was targeting their data. Right? And they didn't have any data resiliency plan in place. And now if you're thinking, oh, I'm lucky, I'm one off out of those 4, not statistically, no, you're not, and something will happen, so you need to be prepared. Now if you glance on the right, 49 million is the lost revenue, right? It's a lot. Of course if you don't have to pay all of the fines, the legal. The wages, the overtime working, the brand reputation, then you can invest to improve your services that you deliver to your customer and your margin will go up up to 20%. right? The thing that stings the most though is not just that it's 49 million. It's not just a cyber event. If you think about it, it could be a service impairment. It could be an API misconfigured on a Friday night, of course, on a Friday night. It could be someone from inside that ran a command. That was not the right common to run. I had too much rights. Right? So, Just think about it. Now glance on the bottom right corner. We have two lines. We have 49%. Of organizations that in the last year, this is up to 2025 paid the ransomware, so 49% of organizations that were hacked, they pay the ransomware. On the top line we have the percentage related to the capability of organization throughout the years of recovering from a ransomware attack using their backup. And if you see the trend that is going down while the trend of companies paying the ransomware is going up. I'm here today because I wanna change that. Rejoy Because we have also good news, not just bad news. We have different frameworks in place, and this is the new cybersecurity framework which is great and it's important for us as it should be for you as a customer or partner. And as you can see we have many services that align from a service point of view for AWS services to each one of those uh phases identity, protect, detect, uh, identify, sorry, respond and recover. Most organizations assume that it's all about security. I will repeat this until you know it's very embedded. It's not just about security. It, it's cyber resilience. We need to withstand, not just protect, and that's why we will go through all of the steps today together. If we look at receipt on what it is and the mental model that is behind it, we will see 3 things. High availability, disaster recovery, and testing. It's really important that we build. Resiliency of your data. Not just protection of your data, not just making sure that no one can access, but making sure that if someone access the data, then we can recover or then we can withstand and then deliver to our customers without even them knowing that this is happening. So this is the cybersecurity framework, the Nice cybersecurity framework. AWS also have a framework. That is called the life cycle resilience framework. We start here setting our objectives, right? What are the objectives RPO RTO availability for our critical application. We can start tiring up the application and depending on which one is the one most critical, mission critical or not, then we tire and tailor the RPO and RTO and availability according to our requirements. So we set the objective and then we design with those objectives in mind. In this case for data, apply this to data we design knowing that we need to recover in. 15 minutes we need to recover our data in 10 minutes, right? And we design and implement those principles like static stability, multi-region. Fellow-based architecture, multi availability zone and so on. Then we evaluate and test. Why? Because if we do not test, we will never know if the resilience that we put in place will actually work. It can be the most expensive, most shiny resilience implementation ever, but if we don't test, we don't know if it's actually going to react the way we wanted it to react when a service disruption is impacting our production environment. Then we operate operational resilience, observability, alarming. We correlate the data, we understand what's going on, why, and then we move to respond and learn we respond based on that, right? We respond. We implement what we learned. And this is a cycle that goes on and on, on and on because resilience is not just one day job, it's an opportunity to implement and it's a continuous interaction with you and your application and it's an improvement, right? It, it doesn't have to be just a one day job it's not like a check box you learn, you understand, and then you repeat. Now, Raise your hand if you're familiar with the shared responsibility model. Good, great. AWS is constantly improving and investing in setting a reliability in their infrastructure. And also security, right? And this is valid for the infrastructure security reliability of the cloud at the same time we expect you as a customer to be responsible for the infrastructure security reliability in the cloud, which means that we give you all of the building blocks, all of the services to actually. Be successful with your application, but you are the one to decide, for example. Do I use AWS site to site VPN to encrypt my data in transit? Will I use DDoS protection? To protect myself from deal set up, denial of services. Will I use to encrypt the data in rest and manage my key? This is the choice that you have. We give you all of the tools. You have this choice, and then the combination of this can also help you in being, if you are in a regulated industry, to be compliant with the regulation. HIPA Dora, uh, needs to whatever right as a solution architect me and Michael are here to make sure that even if from AWS standpoints there is a service impairment that is affecting our side of responsibility you are able to continue operate and deliver value to your customer because you implemented uh best practices such as studying stability, for example, sell architecture. So ultimately this collaboration between us is what really gives the success to the continuous operation and continuous uh value that you deliver to your customer now. Talk about resilience. We talked about ransomware SBD. We see cyber resilience as operational resilience because it should be. Formed by three areas that helps you to protect. Prepare and recover from cyber events. You protect, so you define the boundaries, the control access, security groups, NO, anything that can control IAM, anything. So you set the boundaries and the limits to your entrance to your public endpoints, for example, right? Then you prepare, you develop strategies. It's not just about technology, it's about people as well, processes in place, SOP standard operating procedures as well in place. And then you recover, you have a plan, so that when something happened, you are just executing a plan, you know just what's going on, you know one of those at the beginning of our conversation in that room asking, are we online? What is this? Are we able to reach our public endpoint? I don't want you to be in that situation, that's why we're here, because sometimes we think that we are safe. But unfortunately we're not. So let's talk about protect. We start here. Protect phase is about building the strong defenses to prevent and limit the impact of any cyber incident to your infrastructure, your production environment. focuses on securing critical system and making sure that is the first line of defense you have protecting and withstand against incidents that can happen and especially today, right? AIML, it's everywhere. Imagine. At AWS we have many services. We have more than 250 services. I don't even know myself all of them. But what I know is that we have specific services to help you in the protect phase for your data, for the resilience of your data, in fact. This will help you moving from protecting your data to having your data as resilient. And this is the move we want to move forward to. So we have Ralph 53 years old with DNSywall to help you with domain. Malicious intent and again AI here could be. One of those, right? Especially now VPN to encrypting your transit, uh, your data in transit, network firewall to granularly, uh, layer 3 protection implementation. And then we have Shield Advanced for the dog's protection as well. More than happy to dive deep in any of these services later after the conversation, the sessions, or even at the expo in uh the Venetian for a demo. Now Building on the previous slide, a truly robust data protection frame framework that is not just about data protection but it's about resiliency of your data. Has 3 pillars, security, of course, it's least privileged access, you know. Segmentation you can use transit gateway as well to segment your network at next to layer if there is no route as well there is no issues, right? And then security group and then you can have least privileged access as well all of this together in the security pillar to help you with the data production but we have resilience and there is a reason why it's in the middle. Resilience is the most important pillar because it will allow you not just to protect the data but to continue like I said, to deliver. It's about disaster recovery. We will see it later what services we can use for disaster recovery as well. It's about replication of your backup. It's about not being one of those companies that was 49% that were not able to use their backup to recover from a ransomware. It's about not being in those 54%. That had no capability. It's about not being in those that pay the ransomware. And then governance that it classifies the data it managed the classification, the management, the accountability, the compliance if you have any compliance to be regulated for. And all of this together will move you from just simply protected to resilience of your data. We have a problem or a challenge. Sometimes You tell us. Our customers, that there is too many information, too much logs, too much. And how do we manage all of these logs? It's like it's too much. It's too many services across multiple domains, multiple accounts, multiple applications, too many observability layers in place, which is what you should have. But how do we actually troubleshoot them? It's, it's, and imagine, imagine one second. Imagine you are under attack. There's a cyber event affecting your production environment, and you need to deal with this. It's, it's it's impossible. It's too much. So you can't imagine and pretend that every single engineer or support engineer or analyst can go and analyze every single occurrence that is happening to your application. It's too much. Also, find the right individual that is knowledgeable from an application point of view and also from an architectural point of view. It's very hard And even if you have all of this, how do you manage the scaling out of this data? It, it's difficult, it's too complex. Where do you store it? How much it costs, it's too much. We have a solution. We have a standard process, dynamic series of iterative steps that helps you in this, where the first one is to understand the attacks you face. Where is the attack coming from? Is it an attack? Is it just a service impairment? Is it coming from within your organization? SBD It's coming from inside. Is it the Nemo? It's attacking your public endpoints? Is it network perimeter? So we need to understand that we have different services such as Amazon inspector. Maisy and security hub. Now once we have understood what is the attack surface, where the attack is happening, what is affected, we need to detect the threat within that surface, and for this we have Amazon guard duty. Right? Amazon Guard duty uses ML machine learning and also can be integrated with threat intelligence from other third party vendors. And can help you understand what's going on if there is an instance that is compromised, for example. And he also logs IM activity. So now we identify the surface. We identify what is the threat. We need to investigate and correlate all of this data together, and we have Amazon detective at security hub. Amazon detective will help you to correlate the signals together and give you the visibility that you need without having to go in the dark so that you have the capability to understand what's going on, where is going on, why ideally. And then act upon it. Through AWS Security hub, AWS Security hub can integrate all of this together and we will see it very soon. And automate even self-filling. Actions that will heal. Self-heal your application in case of an attack. It will implement through En Bridge and then trigger some action, remediation action through lambda, for example, AWS, uh, function, step function, a step function. And then give you the possibility of actually act. So with this You have a fully automated continuous interaction. Of steps that helps you classifying the data, understand what's going on, where it's going on, what to do, and ideally gracefully recover from a certain event, right. And here it is continuous improvement implementation. You can scan the barcode to take a picture if you want, uh, you will be prompted with uh a complete step by step guide on how to implement this. This is an example where we of course have in the center, um. AWS security hub that integrates all of the signal coming from third party as you can see from the left, all of the findings or AWS services such as S3 where we store all the data we can store all the data may see VPC flow log you see 2 instances, and then also we have Route 53 DNS resolver firewall, and all of these findings will get correlated together in AWS security hub which will not only. Make sense of all of this for you, but also redirect automated to Ebben Bridge, which then will trigger recommendation and remediation action through AWS lambda or AWS tech function. This will just. All together working seamlessly to help you not only in protecting your data but like I said before to move from protection of your data to resilience of your data. So call to action for protection. Protact face first. Implement multi-layer protection service. Do not just stop at security. I will repeat this again, please do not do that. It's important, but expand your view. Implement resilience in place. Just protecting your data, it's not enough. We have seen that with the data point that I showed you. We need to make sure that we continue. And we are prepared, we absorb the damage. We continue to operate, and we know what's going on. Successful protection means continued improvement. Once you do that. Test I will repeat Test. And I guarantee you, and I've been so adamant on this because talking with my customers, I know how important is testing. Sometimes they have incredible architecture, multi-layer resilience everywhere. It's like OSI model for physical, from physical to application layer, all implemented, and then you say, when was the last time you tested this? Does it work? What do you mean? Test. Evaluate, collect the signal. We have very good services in place, FIS photo injection service test. And then and then address the security investigation challenges such as what I just talked about the continuous integration of all of these challenges use AWS security hub, correlate all together, automate self-heal. Based on your findings. And then use the life cycle framework, the resilience life cycle framework, as well as the need cybersecurity framework to protect your data and to understand and learn and know what's going on so that you don't move in the dark. You know exactly, you just execute a plan when something happens, you just don't, what do we do? You execute a plan. But protect alone is not enough. We have to be prepared. And we have to be able to know how to recover if and when we'll be impacted. Because we talk about data resiliency. I do not want you to be in this situation, right? This is not something. That I would like my customer to be in. I want to change things today like I said before. Michael, are we prepared? What's going on? Of course we are Thank you. Thank you, Christian. And to be confident in this situation when a cyber incident happened. We need to be experienced and of course as we just said we have to be well prepared. We need to know exactly what's going on, what are, what are our valuable assets and what are our priorities, how do we want to act? What is the next step to act. We need to exactly know who to contact if it's internal or external, if third parties are involved. And we have to be efficient the first time, right, because in this situation we know speed matters. If things go south, we want to exactly know how and which order to act, and for that we need to be very well prepared. And preparation builds the readiness proactively before a disruption happens. So preparation, thinking in potential scenarios, take actions and then tests those scenarios and then perform continuous validation and continuous improvement as we gain new insights. We secured the hub and guard duty. We detect threats early. And with Cloud trail and AWS Detective, those tools provide an audit trail and investigative insight. You need to understand how an incidents unfold. While Security hub helps you to measure and monitor the RTO and the RPO of your business objectives. And all together these services help you to move from a reactive firefighting into proactive resilience, ensuring you're always prepared for the unexpected. And preparation starts with clarity. And that's where right modeling comes in to be ready, you need to answer the four key questions. First of all, what are we working on? So we need to understand. Our assets, you need to understand your workloads and your dependencies. Secondly, what can go wrong? So we have to identify our vulnerabilities and our potential failure points. And 3, What are we going to do about it? So defining mitigation plans, having playbooks and fallback plans ready. And then when we have answered these three questions, we come with the final questions and we ask, we have to ask ourselves, did we do a good enough job? So it's all about testing, validating, and then continuously improving things. And this mindset not only turns preparation from a one-time experience into an ongoing cycle of learning and adapting but also creates red modeling. For clarification and prioritization for our further steps in preparation. When you think what can go wrong when you create this red modeling and when you plan for further action and preparation, it is essential to take these three pillars into account, and we speak a lot about technologies days that reinvent, but here technology goes hand in hand with people and with procedures or with processes. Processes need to be very well defined. We need to have clear and named responsibilities and well defined and documented standard operation procedures and checklists. And then you need to train your people once a year, twice a year. Even better quarterly. So that they exactly know how to respond and have the ability to quick and 100% recover or correct recover in case of an impairment happened. You want to be the first time right because we have learned speed matters in detect, in defend, and especially in recover. And our customers, we see different maturity level in preparation. Customers usually start small and they develop themselves further up over time. They start with a baseline approach, having automated scheduled backup in place aligned. With your RPO requirements or your RPO goals. And having a baseline plan is a huge risk windows. So in case a cyber event is happening, you're potentially not able to recover from, and that's a situation we definitely want to avoid. We think it's obvious, but when we remember the numbers Christian showed 50% paid the ransom or the other numbers he showed, I mean, those customers probably had a risk window. And it's 50%. So make sure you have at least the baseline place, uh, baseline plan in place, and then you can further develop toward a more advanced mode where we add additional capabilities. Where we think about things like logical isolation of your backup, protecting your gap, backup with air gap and immutability. And bring a management structure into your whole AWS organization. And from the advanced level you can even go further up to the ultimate state of the advanced plus where you think about extending forensic, so scanning your backup for any presence of malware or ransomware. Having a restore registration in place where you can fully automate restore maybe with a one click experience. To, to be sure, because it's scripted, to be sure that you're following exactly that script and it's highly highly reliability highly reliable because it's tested and it's just a script, it's not a human error in the loop. So two points here. As higher you go, the complexity increases. So don't start with an Apple ones plus status. Start with a baseline approach, but please make sure to have at least a baseline approach. Ready or or executed. In place and then go further up with in a tailored approach so for the most critical application for the most critical data you probably wanna be on a higher level on advanced or an advanced plus level while for easy to recover data, not critical application, it's fine to stay on a baseline approach and that for that reason, no don't use the whole complexity for the whole organization but make take a tailored approach based on criticality. Or in the importance of the data and 2. Don't, um. It's important Oh sorry, it's tough. I'd say both parts. Sorry, I lost that. Um, I'm prepared, but I'm nervous as well. Um, so as an application owner or a business unit leader. Your priority is probably your applica uh your business application and there's where resilience hub comes into place. Resilience hub is a hub or a central place where you define. And uh The the stack of a certain application so you define what is in a certain application like the front end application server, the back end, the local answer, what belongs to this particular stack, and for that stack you define the RTO and the RPO goals for tailored per application. So you can have multiple applications in a resilience hub. With with multiple RT and RPO because they have probably different criticality and resilience hub then detects the drifts and continuously verify and report the resilience level of your application stack toward the compliance and regulation regulatory requirements. Let me show you another best practice which is the 32,110 model of data protection, which is a simple guideline for backing up data. And it's recommended to keep 3 unique copies in addition to the original data source whereof 2 copies should be stored in a separate account or in a separate region. And having one copy in an immutable or air gapped vault. Additionally, you have one local copy ready for operational recovery any time if you need to do a single file recovery or just a quick recovery, so you want to have a. Local operation recovery capability. In addition to that, and because you test things regularly, quarterly or whatever, make sure you have zero issue found in recovery so that you be very well aware, aware and secure that if you need it you can fully rely on. And in addition we have AWS backup audit manager which helps you to audit the compliance of your company wide backup policy against the controls you define and you can prove that to the auditor that you all your backup policy and follow your requirements centrally organized requirements and so that's kind of a. Audit tools which helps you to prove that toward the auditor as well. While we are very well aware that having multiple copies could increase the cost of your resilience strategy. It's recommended to take a tailored approach also here uh just for the tier zero or the mission critical application you probably wanna go with the 3 to 110 strategy which I just defined before, but maybe for the less critical application like tier 1, tier 2, you adopt your your strategy to a 2110 or whatever. So again here take a tiered approach, ask yourself what is the criticality of the assets, how good they need to be protected. Um, and for that adjust the strategy. Depending on that I talked before about air gapping and let me explain what air gap is and how customers are implementing that. So an air gap is a cybersecurities countermeasure that isolates digital assets, data, but also configuration, and I will show you later why configuration is also important to have it air gapped or immu in an immutable storage. And to put them out of reach of the malicious actors to protect the asset. Behind an impaired terrible barrier to prevent unauthorized access or modification. At AWS we see that customers are implementing that with different steps. Some have a 3 object lock in place to ensure the immutability of their data, which cannot be deleted or modified, and they use AWS KMS to encrypt data at rest. They also implement network segment by using network access control list. And security groups. And they maintain separate accounts for the data vault. In a separate geographical region, so for one reason to have a separation of duty, but also to have a geographical isolation of the data. And they maintain separate access credentials for the roles writing writing data to the vaults and to ensure that data is getting pulled pulled into the vault rather than be pushed so that the vault is kind of closed and again separation of duty. Separated access rights and you control what's going in and it's not going to be pushed by someone else. Call to action for preparation. First of all, think in scenarios. Have the right modeling, define your standard operation procedure, and build the maturity through a tiered implementation. And then continuously drive trainings and recovery drills to make sure people, processes and technology work hand in hand in case you need it and you can rely on it. And the journey to resilience starts small, but every test, every recovery drill brings you one step closer toward a business continuity without compromise. So we have seen so far how protection forms the foundation, but here's the truth protection alone is not enough. Protection reduces the risk, but you can still face a breach. You remember the defender's dilemma Christian told you about. Then we had preparation, preparation builds the readiness to act because in that moment when the red flag appear, whoa, you feel probably a lot, a lot of stress, a lot of uncertainties. A lot of pressure and probably the hot air of your CIO in your neck and for that you wanna be very, very well prepared. That's why cyber resilience goes way beyond just being protected but also about it's also about preparing and recovering recovering system data but also whole operations with confidence and with speed. Please put your hand up. Is someone here familiar with this command? Many are And again your hands up who has at least once in his career deleted some files accidentally. Come on, no shame. Probably most of us did some someplace. We have customers who can share a heartbreaking story about those kind of scenarios, some with better luck, some unfortunately with less luck in recovery. And it's not always coming from outside as Christian also told before, uh, SPD, it's coming from the outside and if it's in the air it's too late or it's coming from behind the keyboard in this case and it's called pseudo. And now I think we have an issue. It's, it's black here. Can, can you just help me? I hope you know what you're doing. I try. Because I need to continue. I mean, folks are waiting. We get recorded. I'm pretty, I'm pretty hot. I mean, come on, please, can you help me? Do we have a technician in the room? Paula, can you help us? I mean. Ah, single recovery. Ah, I remember. Let's try. Whoa, that was fast. Thank you. Let's talk about how to recover once data is deleted or we had a breach. Recoveries, recoveries where resilience actually prove its value. Recovery is about restoring system, data, configuration and application quickly like we did after disruption, meeting the RTO and the RPO goals manually or fully automated just like I did with a single click restore. But however you do it, do it with a high level of confidence because you are very well prepared and you are trained. And you've tested everything multiple times. So together the the listed AAA services here transform recovery from a manual scramble into an orchestrated predictable process so that when an impairment happens, the business potentially never stops or get recovered very fast. And as it is with IT in general, it's just the same with recovery. It should following the business priority and the business goals. Therefore, it's important to have the minimum reliable company very well defined. What is the critical path of recovery? What is the sequence of the most essential service to bring back online as soon as possible? What we need to have restored first. To ensure that the value creation is back up, is back online, that we can re-establish our revenue stream, and that we can re-establish the customer core interaction as soon as possible. And the potential recovery sequence could be that we first restore the foundational services like the security of our platform of identity and access management. Secondly, we recover dependent dependent service of the central services like for example messaging buses, some local ends or other central consumed elements. And then thirdly, we finally recovered important business services in a staged approach. This allows us to establish the minimum reliable company. Even maybe at a reduced capacity or use functionality while the full recovery continues, so again here. We may be Take a tailored approach here. Maybe for the minimum reliable company we, we spend a lot of engineering to have a single click recovery in place and maybe for the phase 2 or priority 2 and priority 3 service we go with a more manual approach but still with with defined standard operation procedure very well trained, very well tested, but we don't have to have a sophisticated fully sophisticated service for for everything in place. And when it comes to recovery, two AWS services form the foundation of any, any resilience architecture. AWS backup provides a centralized policy-driven protection with auditing, reporting, and logical air gapped vaults for Annenberg protection. It also supports immutability, legal hold. And it gives you the capability to test the recovery anytime in a in an isolated environment so we can validate your backup actually works in case you need it. And secondly, we have AWS Elastic Disaster recovery, which is a fast automated recovery of workloads and it continuously replicates data and lets you perform nondisruptive drills anytime like, like you do a fire drill. And in case of a serious impairment on site A, you just recover on site B and automatically starts the workload there from predefined template within minutes. And together These two services turn traditional backup and restore into a proactive, tested, and very fast recovery strategy. I told you before about a single click recovery and I also told you before that um having configuration configuration in an isolated world is important and here is why. Let's assume we need to recover from from green field. What we wanna make is to take a configuration out of an isolated vault because we wanna ensure that our infrastructure is code script. We need, we can rely on it. They're not encrypted for some reason, so we take them, we put them into a, um, cloud formation. And we rebuild our whole infrastructure. In this case, these are two instances, the RDS or local policy, whatever is there, the whole stack in parallel we have AWS backup and we restore the data there, in this case, the EDS volume. And as soon as the restore is finished, Amazon event bridge triggers the system manager and the operation center gets informed that the recovery has finished. But eventbridge also invokes a lambda function which gets a parameter of the restore which EBS volume has just been restored and gets the output from cloud formation which in this case EC2 instances has to be re-established and can connect the EBS volume to the related EC2 instance. And now the good thing or the cool thing, it can be fully automated with step functions. So with that function we can the whole process fully automate and that not just once with this we can rebuild multiple stacks in parallel or recover multiple stacks in parallel fully automated with the one click experience. And AWS elastic disaster recovery is the backbone of a fast automated recovery in AWS. And let's have a look how it works under the hood. On the left you have the source server, whether they are on site or in another cloud, and each server runs a lightweight replication agent that continuously sends encrypted data to AWS over HTTPS. That data lands in the staging area inside your AWS account where temporary replication server manage the process efficiently and cost effectively, and you can define even immutable snapshot which keeps data synchronized and temper proofed so they can't be altered, deleted, overwritten, even in the case of a ransomware attack. And during normal operation, you just pay for the low cost storage and the minimum compute for replication. And when a recovery event is triggered, if it's a test drill or if it's a hot event, gearize manually or automatically. Launches the recovery instances and brings the workload back up. In minutes. You can choose from the latest synchronized data, ensuring minimum, or you can take a point in time recovery allows you to restore data from an exact moment, giving you the control and the flexibility during disruption. And ASDRS supports RPO of just seconds and RP of minutes, giving you a near real-time protection. And the best part again here you can test your recovery plan anytime. Without impacting the production, so the production runs on site A and you just test it on site B. That you are again very well prepared and confident and exactly know how it will behave in case you need it. And our recommendation here is not only use. AWS backup or only use AWS disaster recovery, but combine disaster recovery with a 32,110 backup strategy and take the good things out of both combine them in a clever way. And that you have a powerful recovery strategy in place. Call to action for recovery. Make sure to have your priorities well defined in the minimal reliable company. Test the defined recovery priority order again and again and do this fully automated with one click experience of doing it manually following your standard operation procedure and checklists. And that's the beauty of the cloud. You can just do that easy in an isolated environment anytime. So please make use of that capability and make use of the elasticity of the cloud. And now As you have probably heard a lot and you ask yourself where to start or if you need some help, please contact us, come to us, we're happy here to help. And we have lots of assets for you prepared as well where to start and feel free to take a photo here. And Chris Up to you. Thank you. So Take a picture of the cat, that's the most important thing in his life, of course, I love cats, we love cats. Come and see us at the Venetian and the expo hall booth 884 for demo 1 to 1 on any of these services, and if you wanna know more and dive deep. And um. We will be able to showcase some of this to you if you're interested to make sure that. We reduce the number of organizations that have no capability of recovering from the cup like the data that I showed you before and we reduce as well the number of organizations that uh. Um, Pay a ransomware, right? Come also to see us for a swag, stickers, socks. And again this is the same 884 Pala expo. And the Venetian. Thank you so much
