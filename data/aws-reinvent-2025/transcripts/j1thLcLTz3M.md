Alright, well, welcome everybody. Welcome to Reinvent 2025 and welcome to our session The Agentic Advantage How Partners unlock AI's Full Potential. And yes, I did have to read that because it's a very long introduction. Uh, my name is Priya Aurora. I am the go to market lead for data and AI partner programs, and I'm joined today by Mark Ralph, our director of partner data and AI Go to Market. Um, so I'm really excited to be here. I have to share this is my 3rd year presenting at Reinvent, um, but there are a few firsts for me in the session. One, I have never done the silent session before, so hopefully you guys can all hear me maybe wave. Thank you. Awesome, I appreciate it, um. But what I'm told is we can't take Q&A. Mark and I, on the other hand, love to chat and we love to talk, so we're gonna hang out afterwards. If anybody does have any questions, please take your notes, come, come chat with us. We'd love to, to talk to each and every one of you. Uh, the 2nd 1st for me is I've actually never presented this early in the week, uh, and I'm pretty excited about it for this specific session because we're covering Agentic AI, and I'm gonna let you guys all in on a secret, but we might be talking a lot about that this week here at Reinvent. So it's a good opportunity for Mark and I to set the stage a little bit. Um, and our goal today is to cover a few things. We want to talk about the role of agentic AI and the AI evolution, so where we come from and where we're going and why do we think agentic AI is such an important, uh, advancement in the AI evolution. We also want to talk to you all about the role of partners. So out of curiosity, who in the audience are partners? At AWS perfect. I'm gonna assume the rest are customers, so we're gonna talk a little bit about the role of partners both from the partner perspective about what do you need to do in your businesses, what are you seeing or what do customers need from you, but for our customers in the room, we also want you to look around and understand the value that partners can bring for your businesses and your goals with Agenic AI. And then lastly we're gonna talk a little bit about our AWS programs that are made for our AWS partners. While we these programs are made for our partners, they really also are there to benefit our customers and help our customers able to help our customers use partners in a way that supports their business. All right, so with that, um, you know, a couple of things that we're gonna do today. Mark and I are gonna share a lot of our opinion, a lot of what we're seeing in the market, and a lot of, uh, our own observations, but we wanted to make sure to bring along the voice of the customer. So something you're gonna be seeing a lot of in this presentation is data from our annual customer, uh, customer research on agentic uh sorry, on AI and agentic AI. So we actually run this survey every year. We provide it to our AWS partners for them to be able to make sure they have a pulse on what's going on in the market, but also to inform their strategy and their investments in AI and Agenic AI. So we've been running this for about 3 years. This year alone we had 1200 respondents. We have data from about 3000 in total. And what's really. Cool about it is we keep a majority of the same questions, which means that we have a really interesting trend analysis and we're gonna show you some of that of where AI has been, where it's coming, and then we're also serving a lot of people that are at the early stages of their agentic AI adoption and so giving us a perspective of where they think it's heading or what they think they want from it. So with that, let's dive in a little bit. So I'm gonna take us down a little bit of a, uh, journey back in time to 2023. So this is the first year that we ran the survey, and I think most of us do kind of remember 2023 is the year of Gen AI, I think, um, I know Gen AI is history that goes. Well beyond uh earlier than that, but it's really kind of when it made it into its mainstream everyday conversations and what you see here is results from our first survey around what does AI adoption look like in uh the customer landscape and what you see is a few interesting things. So this survey was released in October and like I said, we kind of saw mainstream AI. Kind of interest started early in the year. By the end of the year, so in less than a year, you're seeing really almost every industry, um, start to explore and test with Gen AI. What you do see though is a concentration in certain use cases. So we start when we look back to 2023, we saw a lot of people testing in the area of customer support, software development, and general productivity. Now the same exact data two years later. This is what this looks like in 2025, um, and it's really kind of exciting to see this evolution and what you notice now it's we're beyond the the stage of testing and there's really no industry, no use case that people aren't at least uh running POCs, piloting, or considering deployment of of Gen AI um in their processes. But another interesting thing here is that you're also starting to see more of a move away from horizontal concentration to vertical concentration, and you're really starting to see certain industries pull ahead. And we talked a little bit about why do we think we're seeing that, and we really think of it as three main drivers for where you're seeing a concentration of advanced deployment in Genii. First, each of the industries that we're seeing kind of that strong utilization has a large amount of digitized, unstructured data. So for example, naming a few of the industries that have progressed. Quickest there's health insurance. They have a lot of data on claims and clinical documents in retail. You have lots of product catalogs and then in manufacturing you have engineering manuals and then life sciences investments. You're seeing a lot of analyst research or market research to drive some of the Gen AI opportunities. Second, there's a. Prevalence of repetitive, high friction and expensive processes. So there's really an opportunity to see true ROI in these areas and see immediate impact. And then lastly, you're seeing some very specific industry specific needs and KPIs that as you look towards deploying GEI, you can benchmark performance to and see real value. So I wanted to share a little bit of kind of this evolution that we're already seeing. Started off with use cases moving to strong vertical concentration and then starting to see real progress from testing to true deployment. So here's the real question, what's next? So what's it gonna take to make that same chart go all green in one year? And so you know we've talked about this a lot and there's of course dependencies and investments our customers need to make in data in governance and security, but we really think is going to be the catalyst in the next year is agentic AI. And the reason for that is that Jeni I has been a phenomenal assistant. Full disclosure, I used it a lot in this presentation. helped me with my notes, my speaking marks, um, and just kind of guiding me through it, but it didn't do the presentation for me, and that's where Agenic AI eventually will come in, which is it turns it from supporting the work and being an assistant to doing the work. So I don't want to oversimplify this, right? There's a lot that goes into it and there's a lot that's going to be needed to make agentic AI as powerful as it can be, which is why we wanted to run this session about the value of partners, and we're going to talk a little bit or a lot more about that in a few slides. But before we do that, I do want to hand it back to Mark, hand it to Mark to go in a little bit deeper about what is agentic AI and what makes it so powerful. Awesome. All right, uh, good afternoon. Like Priya, this is my, well, this is my 10th reinvent, but I've also never done the silence session, so it's new to me. I'm also usually the loudest guy in the room, so I'll try not to compete with the noise, uh, around me. Um, for those, I know a few faces in the crowd, but for those who don't know, uh, me, my name's Mark Ralph. I'm the director of the data and AI partner Go to Market organization. And it's a very fun job. I get to work with partners of all types all around the world, and our really core mission is how we work with our partner community, uh, to make them force multipliers for the amazing things our customers can do. And we're gonna actually dig through that really key point about working with partners to help customers do amazing things. You're actually gonna see as we go through some of the data here how critical that can be. But let's focus on Priya's question just for a second about um the evolution of agentic. Now, all right, hot take. A lot of what's being called agentic, maybe up to this point, are maybe just really long prompts. That's my opinion. And the breaking point has been, look, G AI itself, which was essentially human initiated, often, uh, you know, in a chat interface kind of form, maybe a few others, but it was a response to a request highly focused on some sort of generative action, even if it's in an enterprise search scenario otherwise. It was really a tool of the user. Uh, interfacing with that Gen AI application and that was great. Don't get me wrong, I actually think there's a lot of generative AI, uh, use cases that large number of customers haven't even cracked the code on yet. So before we all rush on to Agenic, there might be a lot of amazing work that can be done uh around Gen AI in your organization. But pretty quickly, And I bet a lot of you have had this experience as well, is that the Gen AI, you know, simply interfacing with some frontier model to get cool answers wasn't quite enough. You kind of wish that that model had a little bit of access to your data, maybe had access to APIs, and along comes MCP. It's a nice way to give these models access to tools, and that's kind of great. So now you start to see more G AI deployments connected with these tools. It becomes far, far more useful. Now the deployments become a little bit more complex, right? You start to see creeping into this, you know, it was simply, you know, help me edit my document, help me write my essay. You don't need a lot of access to enterprise data to do that. But now you give it some tools. You are gonna start to think about mm, is my data formatted in a way that this works? Are people allowed to get that data? What's it costing me to get to that point? How complicated is it to maintain that architecture, but. The scenarios definitely start to get more useful and you start to see what is starting to look like an agentic workflow or workflow at the very least start to deploy at scale. We probably have all seen this in our organizations. If you're partners, you're probably doing a lot of this work. But now we tip over for a few, I think there's a number of reasons. One, the models themselves start to get really great at using tools. Uh, they get really great at reasoning and and specific capabilities, uh, things like reading documents, reading structured data, creating documents, doing a little bit of math, writing code when it can't. These models start to get really, really advanced. You then hand them a set of tools and now you get this combination of a model that can actually reason around a problem because it's now armed with all of the tools that it needs. It has, it has its innate capabilities. It has its enterprise data access. There's some maybe advanced access to some of your enterprise systems, your APIs, or other interfaces, and you can actually start to set those agents to work. Now the best place we've seen this is in software development, and if you want to come see me after the presentation, I've been flouting an app that I built for reinvent. I'm not a developer, uh, but a coding agent helped me build something pretty awesome because it had access to GitHub and it had access to a data layer. It had access to a compute layer, it could do all these things for me. It was really great at coding and off it went based on my guidance. And that pattern now starts to play out in other scenarios as well. It's still early on. People are thinking about what is the breaking point between fully and semi-autonomous agents. Where do the humans have to be in the loop? How do you build the guardrails for safety and responsibility? How do those agents talk to each other? Do those agents need a kill switch if something goes horribly awry? How are you monitoring and maintaining? So it's starting to look an awful lot like other architectural patterns that we've seen. This starts to become essentially independent chunks of software that we need to think through all of the elements of compute and data and uh logging and observability and controls that you would see in other software systems. And then ultimately when those agents start to really work autonomously. And I've seen some really amazing examples from our partners. I'll give you one. There's a security ISV that I've been working with. They're in like the DevOps space and on staff they used to have these response or they still have these response engineers, right? People who have been working in ops for their entire lives, they really know how to handle when things go wrong. And they took that experience and they built a set of agents based on that, a prompt just from their wise old incident response folks, and we're able to build agents that can now tackle this large percentage of the day to day incidents that they have come up. That's so and and do it autonomously and it really fundamentally changes how their software works, how they implement with clients, how they deploy, and how they charge for those systems. So you start to see these autonomous agents all the time. And then the ultimate is multi-agent systems. What happens when one agent that's really great at something meets another agent that's really great at something, those two agents start to work together. And I think you'll see across, you know, if you go across the expo hall, you listen to a lot of the presentations this week, this multi-agent collaboration is actually a very hot topic with some emerging standards and architectural approaches to help you do that at scale, but that's probably still pretty early. What's interesting when we did this survey and we asked customers like this path mapped out in the data, like this is how a lot of customers felt that their journey was going as well, and we think it represents like our our customers are moving to the right for sure and our partners are following them as well. And what it means is I think part of the excitement around agents is because they become the ROI and the business value derived from an agent is very different than just what we saw 2 2.5 years ago with the outset of Gen AI. You're now talking about increasing productivity, reducing time and processes, taking out costs. Helping your customers in new and different ways, reimagining your businesses, changing or eliminating processes, like these are the things that the C-suite of an organization like this is what rings true, and about 90% of the organizations that we talked to were looking to implement some sort of engentic approach in their organization over the next 6 to 12 months. And it's interesting because as great as Gen AI is, you know, agentic AI requires a little bit more expertise, not necessarily technical expertise, but business expertise, right? You have to understand how the processes in an organization work. Particularly when you can describe that process to an agent and set it loose on a goal, it's a very, very different approach, and that requires a level of a level of business expertise and like I said, they're far more transformational and ultimately used correctly can lead to giving an organization a significant competitive advantage. So, I won't linger too long in this slide because this is probably the one you'll see variations of this slide all week at RMM. But if you're not familiar, like we spent a lot of time working with our partners um so that they can help adopt our Agentic AI portfolio, that stack of technology that makes making agents um as easy as possible, taking as much. Of that undifferentiated heavy lifting out, you take something like Agent Core which brings you not only just compute but access to things like memory and observability and access to tools at scale for your developers and no matter what sort of stage you and your customers are at, whether it's uh you need super deep access because you're training models, you're doing something in AI that's never been done before and you need to. Be doing that open heart surgery level of AI and access to the raw infrastructure, whether you're looking for more of a serverless approach to help your developers move fast in agentic AI development or if you want to buy an application off the shelf, something like AWS or Amazon Connect or Quiro, these are the packaged pieces of software that we provide. And then, not to mention all of the software from our partners as well, this is the portfolio that we're talking about, so we spend a ton of time with our partners helping them build expertise, build if you're a system integrator, build a practice, if you're an ISV, build this under the hood of what you are building for your customers and so forth. The use cases, and I mentioned a couple. The use cases are really interesting. So we looked through the survey, um. And 3 really stood out. I don't think this is particularly surprising. It's very much an extension of what we saw last year. In some ways it was an extension of what people were trying to do with Gen AI and we're sort of running into the limitations of what Gen AI can do and where agentic AI is maybe a little bit better applied to seeing the business value behind these use cases, but it is things like Customer support is a great example, right? So support agents, lead qualification, logistics optimization, you see a ton of customers working on the support side, um, helping customers, uh, can be at times, you know, it can be a great job when you help a customer solve a problem. It can be occasionally a thankless job if you if you're on the phone with someone who's really upset with you. And if you can use these tools to make sure all of. Your customers are delighted. Interesting things happen is that the people involved in customer support get applied to helping maybe your most at-risk customers or your highest value customers, and also they want to stay and help because they have the tools at their disposal to do so. The middle, um, software development. This is obviously huge. Um, I think the power of the coding assistance at this point is, uh, sort of unmatched. It's, uh, absolutely remarkable what you can do with these tools and in the, in the hands of an amateur like me you can create something amazing in the hands of a professional. You can be building at scale and velocity that we haven't really seen before, but what's actually interesting in the middle is you start to see a lot more sort of modernization projects or migration between platforms assisted by these AI-driven tools. And then there's general productivity. Uh, this is what all of us are probably working on day to day, you know, the business users and all of our organizations, you want really great enterprise search. You want a calendar agent that helps you. You want to be able to track your to do's and project management across teams. Um, you want to be able to build workflows, you know, for reinvent I have. Have a quick sweet powered agent that is helping me all day long prep for the next thing that I have to do. This is my 3rd speaking event of the day, and I have, and it's only Monday for the rest of the week. It helps me understand the customers I'm going to see flags travel time, and I've built that because I've got a knowledge base of my entire week. That's the kind of general productivity people like to see, and we have a number of partners spending time in that space. I'll give you a couple of examples. Um, our partner reply, uh, worked with Totemia, I think is the correct pronunciation, but if you don't know, let's pretend that's the correct pronunciation. Um, so the customer in this case, they are, they sell vacation packages, um, and it's like camping, uh, type vacation packages, and. They're running into this problem where their existing system was like super inaccurate. It, it was very slow. It had incredibly bad latency. They weren't really getting the matches that their customers needed, and reply came in and helped them build a new AI-driven agent that helps curate these vacation options, 65% faster bookings, 40% increase in booking completions, and that was built on Bedrock and Agent Core. Another example, our good friends at Anthropic work with GoDaddy to transform their DevOps infrastructure. So they actually have 600/600 developers at GoDaddy, uh, using their GoCode platform, uh, which is built on cloud, um, and it's really helped drive a new sort of level of software development quality inside of GoDaddy, uh, or Gemact, uh, worked with Apex on. Financial crime detection and triage. This is where agents actually work really well when you can take these kind of workflows that require where the agents are really great at, you know, pulling a claim, looking at an application, monitoring events, and applying at scale. It might be, you know, the flags looking for problems or fraud. And in Apex's case they were able to take out false positives from their old system, so their old system would say this they discovered that it's not, and they were able to help increase by 60% how quickly they were able to resolve the cases. Another great agent example built on Agent Core. So this is the kind of things that customers are looking for when you see these big increases in productivity and cost savings and the way you do things. And it's backed by sets of partners that have built deep expertise in that stack that I talked about. So We've talked a little bit about how Agentic is evolving. Let's now overlay some of the results from our survey about some of the things our partners have to think about because their customers are looking to them for help. So one of the things here is that, you know, Agenic AI is gonna build on all of the progress in Gen AI around, you know, things like model evaluation and business case creation and even change management. I think we're at a point where, look, one of the number 1 blockers to AI adoption in customer organizations is people don't want to use it. And people don't think that their processes can change and like not thinking about the people is a huge blocker, but that's not necessarily new. I think what agents really bring and what partners and customers need to think about is is this skills gap, right? Agents are going to require very business savvy development. We had a we had a roundtable this morning with a bunch of partners, and some are here and I can make sure the story is true, but they were saying look, like one of the biggest things that they have to do with customers is a lot of sort of an evaluation stage and a lot of consultative help for them to understand where Agentic AI can help in their organization because they just don't know yet. Like that is actually a big gap that they have and they are looking for help. And then when you think about the power of these agents and what they may have access to, whether you're a customer, you're gonna be thinking about this a lot, and if you're a partner, you better be really good at. Is thinking about is the data strategy right, you know, is my data state at a point where agents can actually access and use that data well? Is there strong governance around my data? Have I thought through the legal and security and compliance implications, particularly in a regulated industry, that these agents might touch? So this is the kind of thing that is really starting to appear as a top concern for the partners. What's what's also really interesting out of the survey, so. 90% of the customers we talked to who had done agentic work had used the partner, which was up from 73% in the Gen AI days. Super interesting, the reliance, and it was, it was cited because of this level of expertise and 90% of the customers expected to maintain or increase their usage of partners for those same reasons going forward. So as you know a partner in the crowd where you have that expertise, customers need your help, and they are looking and want your help. So that's very interesting. The second is, you know, 35% of the orgs thought that they were going to be relying on partners more because they've actually, and this is the feedback we got, they tried something, it didn't work, sort of stumbled, they never got out a proof of concept, and they realized, hey, we're going to need some help to bring this to production at scale. Super interesting. I think for customers, you know how much help is required, um, that they're asking for maybe as they build their own skills to maybe one day get to that point and for partners just to know, hey, customers are looking for a lot of help. So there's a few places, you know, uh we've talked about so security governance and compliance, um, just how these agents work at a baseline and observability are sort of the top areas that um customers in the survey identified um as areas where they are looking for partners to assist them. And so, if you're an ISV, this is a, I mean, sorry, if you're an SI it's a huge opportunity to. You know, build a practice that has security capabilities that can help customers build out that governance that understands the power of a multi-agent architecture and actually how to get there and understands how to provide the level of observability and monitoring that customers expect. If you're an ISV, you have this chance just to build this into your product because a lot of customers might just want to buy this off the shelf with the security built in, the auditing built in. A level of orchestration between different frameworks and all of that monitoring and awareness built directly into your product. There's a now for an ISV this means identifying your products which then as a custom, you know, if you put then your customer hat on is that ISV means that you might have a lot of work to do yourself and we're there to help you. Another example is, excuse me, is IBM. They did some work with a CPG customer who they weren't able to name here, um, but that customer was running into problems on their marketing side of just how their marketing processes worked and it was all around uh legal reviews of like copy and images and things like that. And IBM was able to you know decrease sort of between 39 and 54 days the optimization on the time, 57% process improvement in terms of getting these projects approved, and then the accuracy of the agent was actually quite high, so they weren't running into problems where the agent didn't know what they needed to know. All right, last thing, and I'm gonna turn it back to Priya. And it's going to go back to. The ISVs Mostly the ISPs. I think if you're an SI or if you're a customer in the audience, I have some, this is my, this is Mark's advice. I think the agentic AI wave is gonna have some significant ramifications on how you build software today. So one is, you know, human versus AI design. Most SAS software is built for a person to sit in front of a computer and use it. If the future customer of your product are all agents, why did, why do you need that same front end? You have to radically rethink the UI for the humans when they need to interface, but the UI for the agents is going to be very, very, very different. And you have to start thinking about that because I think most of our developers are still thinking in a, there's a person sitting in front of it mode. Um, an agent can be given different sets of goals, right? So your software today might be click this button to create an order. That's what its goal was. It was driven by a person. But if those agents can actually react and reason across a bunch of different problems, does the purpose of your software or internal system fundamentally change? Go and seek out fraud in a system, go and seek out optimization in a claims process is not something that you usually ask your SAS product to do on its own. You usually have somebody guiding it. Your core competency, and I might be speaking to some of the SI's in the room and definitely the customers, might shift from coding the thing to curating the thing. Right, context engineering in, in an engentic world is about how you coaxed these systems into following the patterns, giving it the tools so that it can reason and act in the right way is very different than hammering out hundreds of lines of code in a more deterministic system, and that's just a core competency shift. And last. Whether you're selling something or for the customers in the audience, you might be buying something, how you purchase software might really change, right? Uh, our agents gonna be charged by the token? Personally, I don't think so. I think eventually the value of what that agent does and the outcome of what those systems do are ultimately what customers are going to want to pay for, and you're going to have to be ready to deliver on those outcomes. So some key considerations for all of you as you think about moving into an agentic world. OK With that, let's turn over, talk a little bit about the path we take partners through, and I'll hand it back to Priya for that part. Thank you. OK, so we've talked about where we're coming from to where we're going and the importance of agentic AI. We've talked about why partners play such a critical role. So let me go back briefly to my introduction. I said, OK, my role is to, uh, support partner programs and data and AI. So what does that really mean? That means is I have a team that. Lives and breathes by this chart basically every day so we think about what is everything that our partners need to do to be successful in supporting our customers in adopt in adopting AI. And then we work on building the resources and the programs that our partners can use and our customers can benefit from against each of these steps, and this is a combination of best practices. It's a combination of programs and then as well as a long list of resources and as much as I would love to sit down and actually walk you through every step, um, we have a, and I'm, I'm not exaggerating, we have a 60 page booklet that goes through every single one of the steps and resources to make sure that our partners. Are really taking advantage of of the depth of um programs available to them through AWS. I'm not going to be able to do that in the short time we have left, but what I want to focus on is some things that came top of mind to me when I was looking at our survey and our results and going, OK, good, I'm glad we have this program or I'm glad we have this best practice or I'm glad we make this recommendation to partners because what we're hearing from customers says this is important or they need some support or help here. So I'm gonna walk you through um a couple of these boxes that I've highlighted and take you a little bit um through what we call the build market sell and grow phase of the AI partner journey. So first let me talk about what we're seeing around how customers want to buy or how they want to consume agentic AI solutions and what we're seeing here is a pretty strong balance between buy, build, and what we're calling a hybrid approach. And while we don't have year over year comparisons looking at Gen AI, we are seeing a slight in this data point, we are seeing actually a slight shift to buy, I'm sorry, to buy 32% here than we do in kind of our more mature Gen AI phases, and we saw the same thing in early adoption in AI, which is our customers don't want to go out and build everything from scratch right now. What they want to do. Is experience agentic AI capabilities in the applications that they are comfortable using today or go to experts in a specific industry and area and and consume agentic AI capabilities versus being responsible for building that and while that does in theory in some ways translate to OK ISVs, we need you to go build, I would, uh, sorry, to build applications that our customers can buy. I would actually say it's the same thing for our SIs as well right now. I had some great conversations this morning with a few SIs, and we're hearing this pattern which says, look, the more we can build up front 90% structure that our customers can leverage, then the quicker we can get them to market, and that's what customers want today. And so as you think about what you are bringing to market, think about this mix. Of having solutions that our customers can leverage, looking at you guys as expert of what do I need to, where do I need to integrate agentic AI and how do I do it, as well as giving them the customization option through balanced the balanced hybrid offerings and then leaving some capacity for true custom development, especially when you start getting into the more complex agentic AI workflows. So let's talk about what we do for you as AWS to support you through this. Um, so first and foremost, you're gonna hear this term, um, hopefully a lot, uh, which is the AI and Data Knowledge Center. It is where we house all of our resources for AWS partners around AI and data. We actually launched it about 3 years ago here at Reinvent, uh, and it was originally named the, the, um, uh, AICOE. The Center of Excellence for AI through Partner Central and it's actually been one of our number one resource used by AWS partners to be able to get up to date, to get up to-date information on AWS services and features, and we launched it because we are actually innovating at just an unheard of pace. I think last year there was a stat that said that we launched double the number of features than any other AI cloud provider. Another cloud provider in AI and in order for our partners to be true experts, you have to understand and know in depth how each of these AI features and services are working so we want to make sure that you have those resources available to you. Similarly, you're going to see similarly you're going to see your customer research a lot of what we referenced here today on the hub so that you guys can work backwards from what customers are saying and incorporate that into your build strategy and your go to market strategy. And don't worry, I will give you QR codes at the end so you know where to go to access all this information. And then lastly, and Mark talked a lot about this too, which is, yes, we need to support our customers adopting agentic AI, adopting AI, but we also need to incorporate it into our own solutions and our development practices because there is going to be a little bit of a race here with being able to quickly support our customers' ability to adopt AI, and they're going to look to our partners to do that, which means we can't necessarily go through long development cycles. We were. Talking about this actually at dinner last night, which is, you know, we start to hear now that a lot of our startups these days are kind of releasing and building new capabilities with 123 software developers versus a whole group of individuals, and that's kind of the innovation that we're expecting from our partners to continuously build, innovate, and deploy agenda capabilities that our customers can consume. And of course an important investment that we want to make here is funding and so what we do provide for our partners is what we call innovation credits and sandbox credits and these are funding and resources for our partners to be able to just play and test and build with our AWS services and I will let you in on a secret here too. It is our most. Under underutilized resourcing our funding program at AWS. So if you are an AWS partner, please check what what funding you have available to you and please use it. With the amount of features and products we're releasing, there's no reason that you shouldn't be deploying the credits available to you at 100% and then coming and asking for more, and we'd be happy to give you more to do so. So that's kind of in that early build stage. When you're thinking about building, you also have to start thinking about how are you going to go to market. And the other thing that really kind of popped out in our in our data survey and that stuck with me, which is the stat, which is that 80% of customers are likely to use the marketplace in the next 6 to 12 months to buy their agentic solutions. So for those of you that don't know, we have an AWS marketplace that has been growing for the last 2 to 3 years. It's actually become a great go to market channel for many of our ISP partners, and then just recently we launched the AI agents and tools section in AWS Marketplace, and that has become one of the fastest growing listings or areas of listings that we have on the marketplace today. It's also an area that we continue to invest in to provide resources to our partners. So whether that is exclusive funding resources, it's training, it's guidance on how to price and support, it's procurement or procurement services for our customers to make it easy for them to transact. And to purchase their their um solutions on AWS um and for those of you that will, you know, hopefully be here all week at Reinvent, um, I've heard a rumor that there's going to be a great section on Ruba's keynote that goes into a lot of the details around Marketplace and some of the new features and solutions that they're gonna be um. Uh, launching through it. So if you do not for our partners in the room, if you do not have a marketplace strategy, I would, I would strongly recommend looking at it and understanding how you're gonna integrate marketplace into your go to market perspective and think about how you build your products around that to integrate with our marketplace and to think about your marketplace pricing in a way that makes sense for that that go to market channel. Customers in the room, if you have not visited it, I strongly recommend it. You're gonna see a lot of our biggest partners there and actually what's really cool also a lot of our innovative startups. It's a great way to really explore and see what's already available to you in the agentic AI world. that The next thing we talked about, so we kind of, you know, jumping around a little bit, but I've walked a little bit through some of the key points that stuck out to me on the build part of the AI journey, and then we want to talk a little bit about market, and this one is close to my heart. I've spent a lot of, I'm not a marketer, but I spent a lot of time talking to our AWBS partners about what they do, what they offer. And um I'm gonna share this. I did not start my career in tech. I actually started on the dot com side and sometimes it's really confusing when we talk about our technology and it's really confusing when our partners talk about, OK, this is what we do um and a lot of what you're finding today is a lot of your buyers are no longer necessarily deep tech experts, they're business buyers and so that means you have to take a little bit. Different approach to how we talk about our solutions and our products, um, and honestly we've learned that as well too in the AWS over the last couple of years and how we message and talk about our AWS solutions and so one of the best practices that I want to emphasize here, um, is that when we think about go to market messaging it, it looks a little bit different in this space than it may have done in other spaces, um, in, in kind of your in, in technology I should say, and I like to think of it as having three really important phases. The first step right now is education. Um, I don't know if you guys remember this, but when Gen AI first came out in the market, I can't tell you how many times we, I had a partner or a customer come and be like, I'm doing this awesome thing in Gen AI, and, and Mark kind of alluded to this earlier. It wasn't Gen AI. It was good old fashioned AI, which is great. There's nothing wrong about it, but people are still trying to learn and understand what is Gen AI and now what is agentic AI on top of it. So being able to help them understand what that technology is and what can do for their business is actually a really important part in all of our go to market messages. Second, building on that and really being able to explain your differentiation value is important. What we find, and we're seeing this a lot in Gen AI today now, is that what used to be, um. A partner's value proposition is turning into the category value proposition, and now they really have to go deeper and say, OK, how do I personally do this differently? So it's not just to say I do Geni I or I do agentic AI, but here's my flavor of how I approach it and here's my my framework for approaching and driving success for our customers. And so really understanding and building in not just what the technology is, but how do you as a partner layer in your individual value proposition is really critical. And then lastly it's the better together messaging and this is really important because you know you all as our partners and our customers choose AWS for a reason and there are investments that we make into our products to make sure that we are providing the highest level of security, ensuring that you guys can scale your customers can scale their applications to go to to reach their entire organizations, and you wanna be able to help your customers understand. That that that technology under the hood or that technology that you're partnering with is actually gonna be able to make them reach their goals and their ROI, their ROI goals more quickly and so we've had to in the last couple of years I spent a lot of time working with partners building this messaging plan and I'm happy to say that we've also put a lot of programs and resources in place for AWS partners to be able to leverage. These Resources so that they can build these plans and that is working with your PMMs if you have them in PDMs. It's leveraging MDF funding, which is marketing funding that is both for, you know, a lot of our partners use it for their campaigns, but you can also use it to work with agencies to work with consultants to kind of help you build that right messaging, um, and then obviously integrating us into our campaigns as well. And I did skip this point, but it kind of ties to the education component, which is when we did our survey, there's an interesting fact that approximately 40% of people surveyed that were experienced Gen AI users said they were doing agentic AI today. And then when we had them actually explain the use cases they were doing, we'd say about 10% of them qualify as true agentic use cases. And so that kind of gives you that perspective of why education is so important. OK, now the, the thing that I get the most questions on, the most requests from our partners is how do I work with AWS's field teams? How do I align and how do I get AWS to support and create a co-sell motion with me? Um, and one of the things that I would tell you from a best practice perspective is having a very clear point of view of where your expertise are and what industries that you can really support and focus is probably the number one success factor in having a strong um co-sell program in alignment with our AWS field. Over the last couple of years we have shifted our teams. To be uh vertically aligned because of what we're seeing in adoption trends and patterns and customer needs of having deep expertise that understand not just the technology but the applications and the requirements in their industries, the hardest thing for us, and sadly I hear it a lot, but the hardest thing for us is when I sit down with a partner and say, OK, what do you do? And the answer is I do everything. That's actually really hard. It's like sitting down at Cheesecake Factory, and I love Cheesecake Factory, but it's sitting down in at Cheesecake Factory and figuring out what to order when you've got 30 pages of menu and they cover everything, it's really hard to figure out what are they actually good at. And so my ask to all our partners in the room is have a strong understanding of the industries you want to prioritize, make those connections with those. With our AWS teams that are vertically aligned and build clear messaging to your customers that earns your trust that you know their industries that you've had success in those industries and that you can really support what they need um to drive ROI in their specific industries and again a lot of the resources that we have available are deep um uh. Industry level research that you can kind of work backwards from your customer needs in those markets, but we also give all of our partners full access to our sales plays, which is exactly what our AWS field teams are trained on. So whatever we are telling our field teams what we're seeing is the biggest opportunity in industries, we share that with our partners so that our customers in the room. Can kind of can hear one consistent message and really understand what what we see collectively as the right opportunity and then we have a lot of opportunities to to bring and share your uh vertical or your industry specific collateral and industry specific uh resources to our field when there is that strong industry message. And then lastly, this is a significant area for funding and it's not necessarily specifically industry specific funding, but we do a lot of investment funding so customers in the room and partners, if you know a customer that wants to leverage a partner that sees value in leverage in a partner, we have a lot of resources to help minimize the cost of of um of leveraging those partners and so I want to make sure that everybody is familiar with them and that you're helping your customers understand them as well. OK, now the last thing that I'm gonna highlight kind of on our AI journey map is the importance of validations, um, and this, this was actually a really interesting data point, but one of the things we saw is, um, what are the key purchasing criteria that customers see when looking at partners? So what are they looking for when picking what partner? And some of the things that popped out to us is a proven track record having. Dedicated agentic AI practice teams and really having specialized AI talents and then making sure that the cloud provider is recommending and will stand by those partners and the way we do that at AWS for our partners is through badges and validation. So at the top level is our AI competency which you for those of you partners in the room, you know, you should really invest if AI is a place that you're going to play in. Then getting our AWS competency shows that we have worked with you to validate your solutions, validate your customer references, validate your practices and capabilities, and it helps your customers earn trust that we are working together and that you have strong expertise in this area. But I wouldn't just stop there. The other area too is at the employee level, so making sure you have a plan and a strategy for. asking your employees or having goals and KPIs around learning badges so that they're continuously staying abreast of our AWS offerings, our best practices, and what we're seeing in the market as well. And customers, I would encourage you to look for partners that have made these investments to partner with on your, in your AI journeys, AI adoption journeys. Um, and, and with that I just kinda wanna highlight too, you know, we, we work closely with a lot of partners. Uh, Loca is a partner that I have personally worked with. Many of us have worked with over the last few years. They are an AI competency partner. They are part of our new Agentic AI competency launch. They have several AWS marketplace listings, and they're a really great example of what success can look like when you really partner. And use all the different elements of AWS's AI journey. They've got a great success story. One of their customers, Vestmark, really just recently worked with them to launch a wealth management advisor workflow to enable them to reduce proposal generation by over 95%, going from, I believe it's 10 clicks in 5 minutes to one single. Ask by an agent in about 10 seconds, so significantly reducing 15 seconds proposal generation. And so again, great example of both just, you know, success and driving customer success, but also a great example of a partner that has worked and partnered with us to fully leverage all the resources and opportunities and has seen the growth and value coming out of it. OK, so I can't now leave. I've teased this a lot, um, but here is the QR code for the AI data and Knowledge Center. Here you'll find a lot of the resources that I referenced earlier, whether that is the customer survey, that is the playbook, or it's, you know, especially after this week, resources around all our AWS services and launches if you and your teams want to go deep quickly, um, and make sure that you are kind of up to speed on everything that that we have to offer. And then the last thing I would say or the last couple of uh QR codes that I would share both for our customers in the room and our partners is make sure that you are discoverable to your partners. So make sure you are listed as a GEI competency partner by getting um your validations and then make sure you have your offerings available to your customers on the AWS Agentic marketplace. And with that, uh, if you are a partner in the audience, thank you. If you're a customer in the audience, go meet some partners. There's an awesome expo hall full of them doing amazing things. Uh, Pria and I really appreciate you all taking the headphone time with us today. Uh, hope you have a great rest of the agreement. Thanks. Thank you.
