Hey everyone, I'm uh Rahul Dareja from Mortado, and today we'll be talking about how to get your AI agents from the promise that they have to actual real impact. So today we'll be covering the fact that AI is definitely powerful, but there's something lacking. We'll talk about how orchestration is that silent force that really makes your AI agents smart, and then we'll close out with how Vortado's point of view, you know, how do we look at how Vortado can make your AI agents a lot smarter. So, you know, I bring this up everywhere, right? You know, you know, AI has been the, has been the term, you know, for the past few years. Everybody has their own interpretation. Everybody thinks, you know, you know, AI in very different ways, but if you take a closer look, AI is essentially is this layering of orchestration with agentic, right? You have these. Agents that can really help you perform these front end tasks really well where they can take actions for you, you know, they can go ahead and and write emails for you, but orchestration gives them that superpower where they essentially allow you to work on your enterprise applications they allow you to perform actions as creating a new order or, you know, you know, you know, going ahead and, you know, adding a new employee to your company. So, you know, let's talk about. Where we are in the AI journey right now, right? So we know that AI is everywhere. There are, there are companies who have onboarded, uh, AI agents, you, you see the clouds, the, the, the bedrocks, the Geminis everywhere, but what you see is that they're being primarily used for a lot of front-end activities, right? People are using their AI agents to essentially help them write emails, to help them, you know, find information, but what they're not really doing is. Acting upon your end applications, the main power or or or the main data lies in your end applications, the sales forces, the SAPs, the Zendesk that you have, that's where your main data lies, but your AI is not really able to act upon those applications. So what's really missing, right? Your, your AI agents are smart. You have, they, they have the ability to perform actions on your behalf, but why aren't they able to do so? And the answer to that. Is orchestration, right? So if, so if you really try to look at any AI agent or if you really try to look at any enterprise company who is looking to, you know, adopt AI agents for them, 4 main things are of prime importance, right? They essentially want governed real-time access to their data. They want process orchestration, they essentially want a way to define roles and escalation paths, and they essentially want a continuous life cycle. And all of that are the powers that an orchestration engine can can bring to you. Combining AI with orchestration gives you the combined power where your AI agents now can essentially act upon your data. They can go ahead and interact with your end applications, perform actions on your behalf. So if you have to create a new sales order or onboard a new employee, your agent is now empowered to do this with the ability to orchestrate. Now, why does it matter for agents, right? It's, you, so orchestration, you know, allows you to connect your end applications. It allows application A to, to speak with Application B, which essentially is very, very important for, for agents, right? So if agents have to perform something, they need to understand what application do I need to connect to, where do I extract my data from, where do I write data to. You want to implement guardrails, right? You know, security and trust are the number one things that every enterprise looks at, right? They want to make sure that if they have an AI agent that they're using to perform actions, it should be done in a secure and trustworthy manner. You should be able to use all forms of authentication that are available to essentially interact with and applications, and your AI agent should comply with those. This should be enable collaboration right now the way we look at AI agents is as an assistant to an employee, you know, it, you know, it could help a salesperson bring up deals that that have been dormant for a long time. It could help a customer service representative answer questions in a way which can solve customer issues a lot quicker. It can, and your AI agent should be able to. Enable collaboration and it should be able to hand over from a human to an agent any time and finally leave a trace, right? You are having your agent interact with your end applications you want to make sure that you're able to leave that paper trail of what's happening behind the scenes. And that's where Orchestration comes in, right? So orchestration is your silent force. It's the force that's gonna enable your agents to be a lot smarter. It's the force that's gonna enable your agents to essentially act upon your end applications and make them more meaningful. Now, let's try and look at it from a business process perspective, right? Every single enterprise customer, right, they have multiple business processes. Now, these could be my order to cash, my uh procure to pay, or any other process that I have. And at the bottom layer is where I have all of my ends. This is where my data resides. These are my systems of truth of data, which could be my SAPs, my, my Salesforce applications, my, or my other ERPs. On top of that, you have your connectivity fabric. This is how you essentially interact with these applications. Now, forward to today. You already have your agentic layer, you already have your agents that, that essentially are running, and you want to, and you essentially want your agents to perform actions on your end applications. What's the missing link? It's the orchestration layer. The authorization layer is the one that's going to allow interaction of your of your AI agents with your underlying applications, which also lets you enable this deep action layer where your agents can really perform actions on your data. They can go ahead and perform tasks based on what you're trying to do, right? They can mimic what's you know what a human can do, and that's where their, their real power lies, and that's the power that orchestration brings up. Now, You know, a lot of customers have already built a lot of orchestrations, right? The, the, the whole idea of orchestration and iPass is not new, and there are customers who have, who may have already built hundreds of thousands of integrations with AI in the midst. They don't really want to rebuild everything, right? They, they, they should be able to reuse what they've already built, and this is an example where. An AI app they've onboarded and can now interact with your with your pre-built integrations through MCP, right? And MCP is, you know, is a great example where it, it can really enable your AI agents to become a lot smarter without having to put a lot of effort because you already have built your. Registrations you've made sure that that that all of your integrations that you have built, they're they're already using the right security protocols they're interacting with the right applications they're using the right accounts and now you can put your AI agent through MCP and essentially now interact with your end applications and perform those actions. Now this is where, you know, I'd like to talk about Vortado's approach, right? You know, you, you know, with Vortado, our goal was to essentially help enable AI agents to be a lot smarter for them to go ahead and interact with their with the end applications and to take actions on your behalf. Wortado always started off as an. Torate platform and we use the power of our Orrate platform to layer on Agentic on top of it. With our Agentic platform, it, it uses the underlying power of Orchestrate to interact with our end applications and it can allow you to have your AI agents now interact with those end applications through MCP. And this is where I'd like to introduce to Wortado one now if, if you talk to any, you know. Any director or any VP in any enterprise company for them, these 3 facets are the most important for their AI adoption journey. Uh, they want access to the right knowledge, which means that they want access to their company documents. They want, they want orchestration because they want to make sure that it can actually perform actions on a, on a user's behalf, and the number one thing is trust, right? They want to make sure that all of this happens in a layer of governance and in a layer of security. And these are the three things which we kept in mind when designing Vortado 1. So with Vortado 1, as you can see here, right, with Vortado 1, we, we started off as an orchestrate platform, which is, which is our, which is an iPad iPass Plus, but then we layered on top our gentic platform which essentially allows you to build your own agents or leverage Vortado's Enterprise MCP to go ahead and empower your existing agents to take advantage of your existing, existing orchestrations. Now, you might ask me that, do I need to have Rotado Orchestrate to use Roortado Agenic? The answer to that would be no, right? Because you may have built your orchestrations in any language, in, in any software, and you would be able to use Roortado's MCP to to enable those orchestrations, you know, to be used with your AI agents and interact with your end applications. And that's where, you know, you know, I add this, another layer to my diagram earlier, does does the Enterprise MCP, right? My enterprise MCP allows my AI agents, you know, to essentially interact with my end applications, and now all of my deterministic. can now be done in a non-deterministic way through the use of my AI agents, and that's where the power of of of MCP lies and that's where, and that's the power that Rotaro is essentially talking about the power of Rotaro's Enterprise MCP which allows you to interact with these applications. Now talking about our enterprise MCP. With an enterprise MCP, right, the idea was very simple. The idea was the fact that, you know, you should be able to use your existing orchestrate layer. You already have done a lot, you've already have done a lot of work in connecting to your applications, right? You may have the ERPs, the CRMs that you've already connected to, and you essentially are going to use that to empower your agents. You already have agents that are performing all of your front-end tasks. How do you go from those agents who are just performing your front-end tasks to actually go ahead and perform actions on your applications? And that's where my MCP comes in. Now, Vortado's Enterprise MCP. Takes into account, you know, Vortado's 12,000+ connectors that allow you to interact with applications. It uses our preexisting governance model to ensure that you're able to interact with it and applications in a secure way. You're able to essentially impersonate a user to go ahead and perform an action on your behalf. So if I am a support person who wants to go ahead and check, and check the status of a, of a request, the action can be performed on my on on my behalf now, you know, with, with Rotato's Enterprise MCP. So essentially, imagine this, right? Imagine having your agent, you know, be it a cloud, be it a chat GPT, be it, be it Bedrock, you know, to go ahead and say, summarize my open sales pipeline. Uh, it can essentially go ahead and connect to my Salesforce instances, look at my John Paul call records, um, because I already have built those connectors, capture all of that data, and essentially present to me one unified view of, of what my sales pipeline is. Now, the opportunities with MCP are endless, right? You can apply MCP in multiple different scenarios, right? You, you, you can take Your existing business processes, which, for which you already have the integrations, expose them via MCP to your, you know, to your AI agents, and your AI agents will not, are not gonna help you perform that. What that does, it really helps adoption at scale. Earlier, if you had to perform a business process, you essentially would have to go ahead and understand what are your APIs available, what are your services available, and then somebody would have to. Stretch that through in a very deterministic manner. Now with MCP all of that is done through an AI agent. MCP goes ahead and discovers those APIs, discovers those applications, and goes ahead and performs that the action for you. And that's where the power of MCP lies. Now, you know, a lot of times I get asked this question that, you know, every vendor is talking about MCP servers, right? We have, you know, uh, a lot of CRM applications, ERP applications who essentially have their own MCP servers. You know, why, why would you essentially choose Vertado's Enterprise MCP over these vendor-specific MCP servers? Number one, right? It, it all goes back to the whole idea of tool proliferation, right? Back in the days, uh, you know, when this whole idea of orchestration started, right, every single company had their own tool, right? SAP had their own integration tool, um, Oracle had their own. Tool and all of these tools required you to have still, you, you know, uh, a separate you know level of skill for each tool. It also required you to have separate governance models and essentially you, you need to have a separate set of people who essentially were, were going ahead and managing these tools now. What that does, it now with with MCP as well, it's the same thing, right? Every vendor is gonna have its own MCP tool which is, which is gonna have its own security model, it's, its own dominance model, which gets us to the same point which we were about 20 years ago. You know, we, we get to a point where there's again tool proliferation in the states, it's MCP proliferation. Which makes, which makes your life even harder, but with something like Vertado's Enterprise MCP where you can essentially interact with all of the applications that you have through a single unified layer, it allows you to accelerate your value because you're essentially building out an MCP server which is exposed to your agents, which follows a security protocol that you have built out. You do not really need to rely on the security protocols that you have from your vendor specific MCPs. And it essentially is powered by by Vortara One, right? You know, our entire Connectivity landscape really helps you empower your entire MCP MCP adoption, and that's where I say that. You know, without an enterprise MCP you're not orchestrating, you're actually outsourcing control to every vendor in your stack because you essentially are at the mercy of every vendor that you, that has their own MCP server to adapt to their, uh, to, to adapt to their standards and adapt to their guidelines. And that's where Rotado's Enterprise MCP becomes very, very important. Finally, right, um, you know, we, we, we talk a lot about MCP, but one thing that's core to MCP and to AI and for AI to be smarter, is the orchestration layer. The orchestration layer needs to be powerful, needs to be adaptable, which in a sense, allows you to go ahead and build your integrations in a manner which are secure, governed, and scalable. And that's where Vortado's enterprise grade abilities come out of the box, right? You are able to essentially have, you know, a completely managed offering. You are essentially able to, to, to deploy your applications in an always on model. We provide to you zero downtime upgrades. We provide to you log and audit streaming, but at the same time, there are, you can, you can have your orchestrations that can listen to your applications in multiple ways, right? I can listen to a change. In an object inside of Salesforce, I can listen to a new file added to an S3 bucket, and all of that can be done through Vortato. So, essentially, the idea is that, you know, In this agenda journey. Because, you know, you know, AI agents are the future, but orchestration still remains true. You need to, you know, partner with a platform that can really help to make your orchestrations faster, secure, and more enterprise grade, and that's where Vortado comes in. And finally, you know, I would, I would, you know, recommend all of you to come by our booth, booth 1085. We have multiple live demonstrations, um, available that will help you, that will help us showcase our orchestrated energetic platform, show you the power of Vortaro's Enterprise MCP, and essentially give you a flavor of what Vortado can do for your business. Thank you.
