Well, good morning everybody and uh welcome to this lightning talk on delivering the quantum future uh with AWS. My name is Michael Brett. I lead our go to market strategy team for quantum computing here at AWS um part of our worldwide specialist group, and I do nothing but quantum computing all day every day. Ah, that's my job, and I'll be joined on stage, uh, a little later by, uh, my colleague Anna Sarnik. Uh, Anna leads our, uh, startups program around cybersecurity, and she'll be talking to you a little bit more about what some of the, uh, cyber start-ups are doing to increase quantum computing and post-quantum crypto technologies, um, as they build on top here. So, we wanted to share with you a little bit today, just, you know, this is a light. Talk, it's gonna be really quick, really high level, a quick introduction to what we're doing uh in quantum technologies at AWS uh and then give you a couple of concrete examples where startups are getting really engaged in this program as well. Uh, we're delighted to have so many people, apparently this is the biggest uh session they've had at this uh Lightning Talk theater all week, so thank you very much for coming and being a part of this. So quantum technologies is really exciting. This is an emerging technology, ah, there's a lot of potential future benefits that could come from this. You know, it's still very, very early days, um, but what we're excited about is some of the applications that it could unlock uh for our customers as they build. In particular, quantum computers are really good at simul. Quantum physics, so you use a quantum computer to simulate quantum physics, and that leads to applications in physics and chemistry, around like drug discovery, materials design, all of those kinds of things where like molecules come together, you know, being able to simulate that technology on a quantum computer is really exciting for our customers at that level. Uh, also in cryptography, you know, quantum computers could, once we have really, really, really big quantum computers, you know, pose a potential threat to, uh, future, uh, encryption standards, and so we need to start thinking about how we adopt, uh, new standards that are safe against uh the future potential threat of, of a quantum computer. But then there's a lot of other good applications as well, particularly around optimization, machine learning, you know, being able to use quantum computers to, you know, solve some of the really big computationally intensive problems that we use in traditionally high performance computing and being able to incorporate quantum computing along the way. So, that's the future potential space, this is what customers are excited about, this is what we want to help you build on AWS um but let me share a little bit about what we're doing uh specifically today, um, and uh what we're investing in. So we work in 4 different areas of quantum technologies at AWS. Ah, first of all, we have a service called Amazon Bracket. Bracket is just like any other service on AWS. Think EC2 for classical compute, bracket for quantum compute. Um, it's a generally available service, we launched it 5 years ago at Reinvent. Ah, if you can imagine, you know, so we've had, you know, quantum computers in the cloud for over 5 years now. I'll talk a bit more about exactly what we're doing. We've also got a team called the Advanced Solutions Lab, this is a professional services team of AWS who specialize in quantum algorithms. This is the team that you could engage with to do joint R&D together, you know, investigate a particular problem or an opportunity that you're looking at with quantum computing, this is the team that'll help you out. The third is the AWS Center for Quantum Computing. This is where we build our own hardware. So AWS is investing in building its own quantum computers. Ah, you can this is part of the, the overall line-up of compute that we build ourselves, so Graviton, Inferentia, Terranium, quantum computers coming along the line as well. I'll show you some photos of that on the next slide. And then finally, we've got a basket of activities around post-quantum cryptography, um, and quantum networking. Anna's gonna talk a lot more about uh how startups are getting engaged with that over time, but, you know, of course, AWS is investing in security and cryptography, uh so that we can be, you know, we can help you protect your assets against a future potential threat from a quantum computer as well. Here's a quick look at the Center for Quantum Computing. This is our facility where we build quantum computers. Uh, it's on campus at Caltech in Pasadena in California. Um, this is an AWS building. Everyone that works there is an AWS employee. Uh, we share some faculty and resources with the university, um, but it's an effort to build quantum computing hardware. Um, the particular approach that we've taken is around superconducting qubits. You know, there are many ways to build a quantum computer, you know, roughly 5 or 6 different ways that you could, uh, build an architecture for a quantum computer. The one we've selected is based on superconducting qubits, which is, uh, a, a reasonably common one at this point, you know, many other companies are looking at this technology. The particular approach that we've taken is to look at building error correction technologies directly into the chip itself. And so you can see up on the slide here, the actual quantum chip is about the size of your thumbnail, it's a piece of silicon, ah, there's some, you know, exotic materials that sit on top of there, and you lay down a, a, a quantum computing circuit rather than a classical compute circuit, and we're starting to embed the error correction technologies, uh, directly onto the chip itself. We had a really great announcement earlier this year around a chip that we call Ocelot, uh, the Ocelot chip was a demonstration chip to show some of those error correction technologies in action, ah, and we got some extremely promising results from that. We're essentially able to knock a few orders of magnitude off the resources required to do error correction, uh, on board the chip itself. So you can see the link there, you know, look up the AWS Ocelot quantum computing chip, uh, to read a little bit more about what we do. So what can you do today? Well, you can access quantum computers through a service called Amazon Bracket, uh, and Bracket is just like any other service on AWS, you know, it is there to get access to pay as you go, no upfront commit, your on-demand quantum compute services. So the idea is to deliver a consistent experience for you. Consistent in the sense that it looks and feels and operates just like. It is AWS, um, but it's consistent across many different types of quantum computer. So today we offer a range of different quantum computers and different modalities, and we provide a consistent experience across all of those different technologies. So a single API, a single software development kit, a whole bunch of different ways that you can access those. So today we've got third party quantum computers. I'll share that on my upcoming slide. And of course our uh AWS built quantum computers will be added to that line-up over time as well. Um, we're not making any announcements at this reinvent about when those computers will be available, but, you know, in good time we'll of course make those available through bracket. And then the customer workloads that we see today on Bracket are are mostly in research, you know, most of my customers are researchers, they're at universities, they're at national labs, and they're doing science on these computers. So they're accessing the quantum computers to, you know, do physics experiments in, in the quantum computers themselves, do computer science experiments to design new algorithms, ah, and they're also looking at applications and trying to benchmark. classical. Yeah, we connect the available quantum computers to these customer workloads are provided. Consistent experience on Bracket, um, so you can access that today if you need. Looks like my microphone's coming in and out. So, how do we build it up? So at the infrastructure layer of bracket, we've got a range of quantum computers, QPUs, uh, we also have a range of simulators. Um, the simulators run on classical compute on AWS and that allows you to test and debug, uh, at relatively low cost before you deploy. To the quantum computing hardware itself, uh, and then, every quantum computing algorithm is a hybrid algorithm, which means we need both quantum and classical working together, and so we provision a bunch of CPUs and GPUs to run alongside the quantum computers as well, and help you orchestrate uh that overall workflow. Sitting on top of that infrastructure layer, uh, all, all of our capabilities, uh, around software, so, uh, uh, AWS standard API, uh, we've got our own software development kit, um, Uh, a whole bunch of notebooks in, in Jupiter Labs so that you can start to explore and, and try things out, and then we connect into a range of third party software libraries as well, so you can connect into, um, uh, programming languages like, uh, Open Chasm or Kiskit, if you've worked with the CSSkit quantum computing software libraries, uh, Kuda Q from Nvidia. This allows you to bring any software development environment that you like in quantum computing onto racket as well. And then finally, uh, up in the top right there, a whole bunch of uh companies that we work with that build on top of Bracket and provide a value-added service on top of that. So these are AWS partners that have built software that helps these quantum computers run better. ah and uh I saw one of our friends in the crowd today, um, Uh, from, from Que Control, uh, so Q Control on the top right there, Que Control build error correction software for quantum computers, and so that helps our computers run faster, get, uh, more accurate results, and get. Companies as well, so we're really excited to build with some of these startups ah that are looking at, you know, extending what we make available through the infrastructure layer, so uh we really appreciate them and Arnold will share a couple more examples about startups getting engaged with us. So how should you think about uh quantum computing in the cloud? Well, it's just another computer, right? It is just another uh instance type that you can work with. So already today we have a range of accelerated compute that you can work with. CPUs and GPUs and other special purpose accelerators like inferentia and tranium, or quantum computing is just one more instance type across. That. And so when you think about where quantum computing fits into your overall strategy, you know, think about it in that context of high performance computing, having a portfolio approach, allocating the right algorithms, the right workloads to the right processes to do, to do that work. So quantum computing's not gonna replace what you existing, you do uh already, it's more going to augment, um, and be able to provide an accelerator, uh, to some of the workloads that you're most interested in. So where are we today? Well, quantum computing. Today is more about investigating quantum computing itself. The number one application that we have for quantum computers today is to study quantum computers. So we're essentially studying the hammer. We've built a tool and we're studying the tool. But in the future we're gonna start using that hammer to look at some of the applications that I mentioned on on the very first slide around chemistry, machine learning, optimization. And so we are here, we're at the point where we've gone from characterizing hardware and understanding it, to now starting to research the quantum algorithms that get better and better and uh allow us to start to take on some of the, uh, some of the potentially useful customer applications. So we're right at this cusp. The next set of use cases are going to be in science, so it's like looking at how do we use quantum computers to accelerate scientific discovery itself. So particularly in areas like high energy physics or chemistry stimulation, you know, these are value added workloads that national labs, you know, the Department of Energy, you know, NASA are going to be using quantum computers to do ah large scale work with, and then eventually getting up to solving industry relevant problems, so like our big enterprise customers uh will start to use that work. So, what we have available today on bracket. We've got 8 different computers from 5 different providers, so these are all different quantum computers. These are different brands of quantum compute, um, so we have 2 different kinds of ion trap based quantum computer. On cue. Just launched 2 weeks ago a new computer from a company called Alpine Quantum Technologies AQT. They're a European-based quantum computing provider. This just went on bracket 2 weeks ago, it's our latest device that's available there. Then 2 superconducting-based computers, ah, one from Reggeti and one from IQM, ah, and then finally a neutral atom-based quantum computer which does some really interesting work around like analog programming on that. So what we have for you is a wide selection of different quantum computing technologies. You can access all of these on demand, you can explore, you can see why they're different, you can start to get a sense for, you know, the um, The differences between them and the potential future opportunities there. So these are all available on Bracket today, you can access them on demand, you can start to program them, uh and get a sense of why this is different and why it's such a different technology. So before I hand over to Anna, uh, just a, a couple of last points about the overall pathway that we're on right now, uh, to do uh research and development together to get ready for quantum computing. You know, we're right at the cusp of being able to do some of these like large scale scientific workloads, and so what we do together with customers is to discover use cases, we'll consult with you, talk to you about, you know, the potential future applications of quantum computing. Then we'll research and design algorithms and do benchmarking work so that you can understand, you know, how this is going to impact your business. Then we've gotta push the boundaries, we've gotta make these computers go faster and faster, make the algorithms more efficient, integrated in with uh our classical high performance compute, and then lay that groundwork together so that you've got the IP, you've got the supply chain, you've got the workforce in place that can start to adopt this technology over time. So I'm gonna hand over to Anna now, who's gonna share a little bit more with you about how startups are getting engaged with AWS generally and then uh share a couple of stories specifically about how uh quantum security companies are starting to uh make use of this technology, so over to you, Anna. Alright. You know, but Thank you Michael. So just to give you a little bit of an overview for our startup program, we have several 1000 cybersecurity startups globally building on AWS today, and the way that my team engages is we're responsible to hold relationships with the top investors that are. Investing in cybersecurity innovation are collecting feedback from security practitioners where, um, post quantum crypto is one of the top 5 topics that has been coming up this year and we're also responsible for identifying the upcoming top founders that are going. Going to be building on AWS and supporting them in the right way of resourcing whether it's connecting to resources like bracket or engaging with our product to leader with our leadership to help ideate on what direction AWS should be innovating down the line in the future. So I just want to build on that story and share a couple of slides about um the companies that are earlier on in their journey with Amazon. As far as a partner, as far as a startup that are building in the post-quantum crypto space, the first one is QSecure. So this is one of the companies that is providing end to end protection. Um, for the post quantum cryptography, the great thing about these technologies that are post, uh, popping up today is that they can be deployed in any hybrid environment. They're available on-prem. They're available on cloud, and enterprises are able to start adopting these technologies in their existing infrastructure to be. Ready for when the post uh quantum cryptography problem is becoming more prominent today. So what we're doing here is we're bringing in startups, we're enabling our enterprise customers to access them and engage with them so that they're able to be more forward looking and proactive in their security problems. And the second example here is um is Potero. So this is another company that is helping to develop that post-quantum cryptography technology that is going to help address this deal now decrypt later risk. It's going to help develop that zero trust architecture for endpoints as we're trying to think about how do we, um, embed the future security technology. As quantum computers become more and more prominent in the technology that it's embedding in new cybersecurity threats are emerging, and again, the best part is that it can be deployed across across the existing environments today, right? So these startups are thinking about how can this technology be ready for the existing infrastructure as we also continue to think about the problems that are developing down the line. So these are just some of the two examples that are early on, but this is really folding into, like Michael said, with a lot of the third parties that we work with, right? We work a lot with, for example, Nvidia as well. I run a cybersecurity accelerator for startups where as we think about how do we develop more and more useful. Technology and prominent required technology for enterprise customers and partner with innovators and startups like many of you in the room likely are today. These are the type of companies that we're helping to support and helping to surface within the enterprise so that we can continue to solve the problems of the future. So I'm going to wrap it up and here's some resources that you can access around the topics that Michael discussed for bracket and um we're happy to answer any questions that you have around the startup program or any of the quantum computing services that we offer today and down the line. And thank you for attending. There is also additional quantum computing sessions that are available for you at Reinvent. If you scan the QR codes, there will be additional technical sessions that Michael and the team that he works with are working on. So thank you.
