Hi everyone. Uh, excited to be here. Uh, thank you all for coming for our session about, uh, vulnerability management in the cloud. My name is Amos. I'm a product manager for, uh, Tenable, and, uh, before I start, so I know my crowd a bit, uh, which one of you by a show of hands is familiar with Tenable? And uh tenable VM. And tenable cloud security. Cool. So, uh, let's start. So what are we going to talk about today? We'll start by speaking about the challenges and the different uh complexities of uh vulnerability management in the cloud and why is it different from uh doing the same uh on-premise, on premises. We'll talk about tenable and specifically tenable cloud security and why I believe we are a great partner for you uh to have for the vulnerability management uh program in the cloud. And uh by uh also about our brand new, I think 2 weeks old, uh, cloud VM offering that is really unique uh and uh can solve a lot of your problems. And, uh, obviously we'll see it in action, uh, with a live demo. So, uh, there are many challenges for vulnerability management, but right now we'll focus on on the cloud and why is it different than the standard challenges of VM. So the cloud has unique workloads with unique workload life cycle, especially containers. They are stored in their images are stored in container repositories. They are spun up, taken down. They're very ephemeral. They change all the time, which creates challenges of visibility. It's hard to know what's going on. And these visibility challenges make it really, really hard to operationalize agent, uh, agent-based solutions. It's hard to deploy everything, it's hard to manage everything, to create decent coverage, uh, so these solutions basically don't really work in the cloud. On top of that, cloud environments are very complex. They have tons of different resources, tons of different services. Each one has its own configuration, which creates a very non-trivial context for the vulnerabilities, and you must, you must know the context to prioritize the vulnerabilities as well. So you have the challenges for the cloud, but it becomes even more complex when you combine it with Uh, managing the also managing vulnerabilities on-prem. It's hard to have one solution to answer both, uh, all of these challenges and the on-prem, uh, challenges. So the mostly, most solutions only do one of them, so it's hard to, uh, solve both. So, uh, we have challenges why I believe we're a great, uh, vendor to solve these challenges. So Tenable is a leader for over two decades in the vulnerability management domain, and why is that? Uh, we have a really, really good vulnerability intelligence, uh, which helps, helps you prioritize what intelligence, what sorry, vulnerabilities you need to solve first. Uh, CVSS isn't really good at doing that. 60% of CVEs have CVSS that is high or critical, so basically you can't prioritize based on CVSS, and with Tenable's vulnerability priority rating, our proprietary scoring for CVEs, it's more than an order of magnitude. Lower than that, so it's really easy to know what you should do first, where to focus, uh, and you might ask yourself, alright, what, what are you doing there? How do you prioritize? So we take many different risk factors including uh knowing what real threat actors do and where you push all of these factors into our proprietary machine learning engine and it and it creates a new scoring which is much, much more accurate. On top of helping you prioritize, we also help you remediate. We also help you remediate efficiently with our uh plug-in ideas. What's a plug-in? Uh, in a plug-in is a grouping of CVEs where we tell you that with a single action, what's an action, uh, like a software update or, or a patch, you can solve multiple CVEs. So if we tell you that this, if you operate this version, you only solve one CV, but if you do this, you solve 20 with a single action, you obviously want to start with solving 20 CVs at a time and it makes and it helps you create a more efficient remediation program. So for over two decades we did great vulnerability management, but in the recent years Tenable also became a very, uh, a very important player in the cloud security market and the exposure management, uh, exposure management market. So let's talk a bit about our cloud security solution, just one sec. Yeah, so Tenable cloud security connects to your cloud environment or cloud environments, even uh uh multi-cloud environments and basically reads everything to uh and help you create an inventory of what you have there and where your risk lies over there. We take, we look at everything from uh IM configuration, uh, data and data assets, obviously vulnerabilities. Uh, and create a unified view of, uh, of the risk and the, the different context for everything and why should you care even if you care mostly about vulnerabilities. We can take a look at this, you can see the toxic combinations over there with the red, uh, rectangle. Where you can see that we don't only show you vulnerabilities, we show you the context. We take everything we learn from the cloud as a context for vulnerabilities. If you read the first one, we tell you that you have critical vulnerabilities, but these vulnerabilities are also. So on workloads that face the public internet and they also have high privileges. So these are the vulnerabilities you want to solve first. Obviously they are much more important than vulnerabilities and assets that don't see the internet at all. And Once you do, you know all of your cloud risk, you want to push it into our exposure manager platform enable one, recently selected by Gardner and Forrester as the number one leader in exposure management and what's exposure management? Uh, you have many, many different tools I assume that uh collect and analyze risks in in different places of your environment, cloud, on-prem, OT, whatever, and. You want to have a centralized single pane of glass, uh to see uh all the risks, and this is sustainable one we normalize the, the information and, uh, and create a unified uh risk view. So we'll see it uh in action a bit later, uh. And now I'm, I'm really, really happy to, uh, talk about our new offering. As I said, it's only 2 weeks old for a cloud VM. Why did we build this offering? So we talked to many, uh, VM professionals and they told us. Alright, uh, we understand what you're doing in the cloud. Your Synap cloud security platform is great. Uh, we see it provides a lot of interesting, uh, insights, but we want to start more focused on vulnerability management. So we may get there a bit later, but we want more lightweight solution that only solve these specific problems, and we listened and we did it. So Cloud VM is a lightweight solution focusing on vulnerability management. In the cloud. What use cases are we trying to solve? So, first of all, you have assets in the cloud, you want to know what vulnerabilities they have, we do it relying on the same uh the same uh vulnerability database that we talked about before. Uh, we can support migration from on-prem to cloud because you want to have during this process, it can be challenging to have a view, continuous view of what's the current state of your risk, and with this offering you can do it. And once you have a hybrid environment, you want to have a single pane of glass to see all your risk uh of everything from your on-prem environment and in the cloud, uh, with a unified view. So all these use cases are uh supported here. And now, uh, let's dive into the offering and what we're doing there. So in the cloud, two major types of workload of uh workloads, uh, VMs and containers. Containers are more standard, more similar to on-prem, so we'll focus on, uh, containers that are more unique to the cloud. Containers Containers have a unique life cycle. They start as a Docker file in your code repo, then you build the image. and push it into a test container repository, container registry, you test it, you, and then when everything is good, you push it to your, uh, production registry and into production and We believe that you need to uh to analyze the risk and to surface it as early as possible. You, you don't need to waste the run time. You need to do it as shiftless as possible because it's easier to fix. So our solution analyzes the risk from the test, uh. The, the test registries all the way to runtime because you always want to check also all the way to the right because this is what's actually running and you maybe you missed something when you scanned the registries and you want to see what's going on in there. Uh, so let's dive another step inside. Uh, we do it, we do all of it agentlessly. As I said, the agent in the cloud is problematic. It's hard to deploy, so we scan without an agent. You just connect us to a cloud environment and, and it's very short. It takes minutes, and we scan the workloads, both VMs and containers. We create a comprehensive software inventory. And from the inventory with the vulnerability database we create a list of all the CVEs that you have uh in your in your environment. On top of doing the runtime analysis, we connect to your uh image registries, the container image registries, and we analyze them. So with the cloud connector. We can scan uh ECR repositories, but we don't stop there. We can also connect to third party reposit. We can connect that there, provide the relevant permissions, and we can read the images from there, but also correlate them to what we found on runtime, so it's not separate. Uh, and once we have all of the information from all the vulnerability that we found in the repositories and in runtime we combine it also with our exposure management platform to combine it with the vulnerability findings from other places, uh, in your organization, uh, not just the cloud. This is the, uh, we'll see it again in a demo, uh, right about now. Yeah. So, uh, now, uh, let's see it in action and, uh, uh, I'll apologize in advance. The, uh, video controls are a bit challenging, so, uh, I hope it goes smoothly, but if not, bear with me. Oh, yeah, you see, I, I told you, uh. Yeah. Yeah, so here you can see the, the dashboard. Oh, yeah. You can see the dashboard, you can see the different trends, uh, you have, uh, here how many vulnerabilities you have in your environment. Uh, you can see the MTTR analysis based on the severity, and you can see different on the bottom, you can see different aggregations by different factors of the vulnerabilities we found in your environment. So you can see the uh the inventory here we first focus on The, uh, container container repositories you can see here the, the list of many, many different repositories we're connected to, um, let's, uh, uh, click one of the images. And see the findings we found on the, on the image. We'll start with v vulnerability findings. You click here and you see a full list of what we found on this image, all the vulnerabilities, a lot of information about it. We don't stop with vulnerabilities. We also scan for malicious files we found there on the image. Here you can see, for example, uh metasploit files that have no business being on production images, and we found them on this container. Um Now after we saw findings on container images, we can see findings on actual workloads found on runtime. Uh, here we'll look at VMs with vulnerabilities in them. You can see we found many resources, we'll choose one of them that has vulnerabilities, and you can see an overview of what we found there on this workload. Here again, a full list of vulnerabilities on this runtime workload. And the uh full software inventory, whether vulnerable or not vulnerable, and if you find malicious files, you can also see them there. And another, the next very important view is a full view of all the vulnerabilities we find in your environment. You can filter them, for example, by a specific account and uh by severity so you can focus on the things that you really want to solve first, uh, high and critical uh vulnerabilities. Uh, and not only that, uh, for example, uh, let's take the case where your, uh, CO called you, told you, my friend told me there's this new, uh, new attack, a new vulnerabilities. It's called zero logon. Are we impacted? You can go here. Look for the new threat by name 0 log on. And you see the uh where we found it in your environment. Yeah, here you can see the uh different uh scores, both VPR and uh and CVSS. Here you can see the different risk factors we take into account when calculating the VPR. And um Yeah, and at the bottom you see the, the real world events, the different things attacker did that impact also the severity and the trend over time, the VPR can be reduced and then increased uh according to the real world events that we found. You can also view it as a timeline and if you click it, uh, you get more information about the, uh, the event that we're talking about. Uh, on top of that you can also search by uh CVEAD, uh, and see the information about the, the specific CVE. Uh, and you can see the impact it has on your environment, where you found this CVE. You can see the full list of all VMs impacted by this vulnerability. And also all container images and also software packages that have this vulnerability uh in runtime. Now, uh, we're moving to tenable one, our exposure management platform. Here you see a unified view of the exposure of the risk you have across all of your environment, not just cloud. You can see also OT, uh, web application scanning, whatever sources you have for, uh, risk and vulnerabilities, but you can also, uh, look at it per exposure type, per category, per uh source. You have also a unified inventory of all of your assets and what's really, really cool here is that you have the uh the AES, the asset exposure score that normalizes the risk for all your assets into a one prioritized list which is really non-trivial because usually you must go to different tools and see they say this is important, they say that is important, how do I know what's most important? Here you look at this. With this score, and once you have this unified score for everything, you can create programs that take into account risks from different places. So let's look at cloud migration that we mentioned before. We can tag some resources as related to migration, some from the still on-prem, some already in the cloud, and they are tagged. And once they are tagged, you can create a card that lets you monitor this program, this project. Here you have uh And and an overview you can see the custom dashboard, the custom view we created for this project, for these tags, and you get many metrics that give you very, very deep visibility on the current risk and the trends over time and whether it's glides, whether it's still on-prem or is it mostly, uh, mostly on the ones that already moved to the cloud, and you can see a dashboard that you can really customize to show whatever you want to follow different metrics you really, really care about. Um Cool. Um, so, uh, this is the demo, and, uh, before leaving, uh, let's focus on the things that I really want you to remember once you leave this meeting. So I talked a lot of these are the most important things. Uh, so, um, Yes. If you haven't already, you really should do vulnerability management in the cloud because it, it has, it has vulnerabilities. You should get a hold of them and see what's important, what's less important. When you do it. It really, it's really, really better if you do it with a unified program for the VM for for VM in the in on-prem and in the cloud, and to do it, it's better to do it with a vendor that has really deep expertise both in vulnerability management and in the cloud, and I think we, we, uh, we are such a vendor. Remember that we have a brand new offering for vulnerability management uh in the cloud, uh, that is lightweight, that is uh first step into the cloud. And uh if you want to hear more about this or anything tenable, feel free to uh come to our booth, 251, it's just click over there. So uh I'll be there and other people will be there and we'll be happy to answer any of your questions and I'll also be around here uh if you want to ask anything now. So, uh, thank you very much.
