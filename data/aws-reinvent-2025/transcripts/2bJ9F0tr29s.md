Good morning. Welcome to Reinvent 2025. I'm very excited to be here with all of you today. And kicking off this week uh with this session. This is COP 347, Actionable Controls for Improving governance and Compliance, and let's get right into it. If we think on cybersecurity as a building, right? Controls are it's hidden architecture, those bolts and beams that actually holds every wall. Uh, but the challenge with something like compliance is like, every regulatory, uh, compliance program starts with a legal abstract, like, organizations shall ensure that. Uh, controls are in place for encryption. So what does that mean, right? How do we bridge that gap? How do we move from those regulatory statements and those abstract legal paragraphs to actually going and implementing controls? Thankfully, that's the goal for us today. We're gonna go from implementation types to how do you discover a map controls and how do you actually can assess and monitor those controls using AWS managed services, right? Hopefully by the end of this session, you will feel comfortable enough discussing strategies to how to implement those controls and what are the different services that can help you achieve that in AWS. This is the agenda for today. We're gonna go through the life cycle of controls, er, and at the end we're gonna have of course some key takeaways. Let's start with a question. To whom and why are controls important, right? And many of you might be already familiar with this, but we're gonna have many stakeholders in the whole process, right? We're gonna have our business personas. Those folks are looking for rapid market adoption, uh, seizing new opportunities right from the business, uh, side of the house, keeping minimal barriers for innovation. We also have our developers, right? Our developers, they want. Actually autonomy on their work. They don't wanna have, like, be asking permissions every single time they're trying to do something new, right? They will have they will like to have that flexibility. And also very important, they are gonna have like minimal barriers, last minute changes that they need to do because there is some compliance concern of some security issue, right? They wanna be prepared from the start, right? So let's take a look on this. First of all, Uh, I would like to introduce myself. I forgot. My name is Rolf Lorenes. I'm a principal cloud solutions architect, and today with me is Arnold Colonre. He's a principal product manager for the AWS control tower team, and we're very excited to have you here. Now, as I was mentioning, we also have our security personas, right? And this is one of the key ones. They want, they would like to have proactive controls instead of reactive controls, right? They would like to make sure that they are following the security posture, the guidelines of our our of of our organization. And also Not to say the least, we also have our risk manager, right? They would like to make sure that the actual organization is following and adhering to the risk appetite of our company, right? So all of these play together and the the key is striking the right balance between all these personas. But the problem is that something that sometimes people forgot is that without any senior sponsorship sponsorship or leadership, let's say participation in this, is very complex, right? So we need to make sure that we have that before we even start because we can have all these multiple personas with competitive needs and if we don't have that, it's very hard to make sure that everyone plays nice together and we are looking into one single goal, right? So that's very important as well. Now, as we just saw, we have many stakeholders in AWS. We see cloud governance as a key core component on every com uh of any part of the organization. We see this in four main pillars, right? And the, the whole idea is to provide you the proper foundation that goes from AWS accounts to the guggles that you put in place to all those controls and how you can actually automate that. And we do that focusing on 4 key domains. The first one is security, of course, as we, as we just mentioned, this is looking to make sure that we are following the security program of that organization. Then we have our operations team. They're also concerned about governance because that will help them make sure that they're performing as expected, right? What is expected? Are they resilient enough, right? Some things, not just security, is part of cloud governance. Then we have our compliance teams, right? Our compliance objectives. This is basically making sure that you are also being secure, you're operating as suspected, but you're aligning to your internal and external policies. And then, last one, I'm sorry, last one, we have cost, right? This is very important. We also need governance for cost because we wanna make sure that we are operating successfully while being cost effective, right? So what are the things that we can do here as well? And at the very bottom, we need to focus on every of these objectives, but what we're really doing is actually mitigating risk on every single domain, right? So that's the whole idea and with that in mind, We start seeing some challenges, right? The first one is striking the right balance between innovation. And it and and controls, right? How do you keep that right balance of your developers doing what they want to do but making sure that you are following the best practices of your company in terms of security? How do you keep pace on evolving regulatory environments? And this is something that we see with a lot of our customers. We see. Now and then, every single, like every month, like the last year has been really, really, really chaotic sometimes in terms of regulatory changes. The EUE Data Act, for example, everything related to generative AI, these are things that keep evolving and it's not just that every single time that you may see something new, but also it it will vary depending on the region that you are, right? So keeping pace of this is also a key component. Meeting agility demands to support business change. This is you're decreasing the time to value, right? You are developing something new, something exciting for your customers, but you really need to get that into production. So that's one of the key challenges. How do you actually make sure that your, your mergers and acquisitions are going smoothly, that you're not making any too much exceptions in terms of your controls that you wanna put in place. And of course, enabling cost and operational, uh, efficiency. That goes without saying, right? You wanna do all, all this, but you wanna make sure that you're scaling consistency and at a cost-effective manner, right? So how do you start working on this? It has to be a risk-based approach, right? You need to follow a risk management framework. The idea with this is because it is a structured systematic blueprint that allows you to take an approach that is probably gonna be very similar to every single thing that you're doing, right? And it has to be a unified strategy, but it also has to be flexible enough, right? Because not every workload is the same and also, I repeat, it has to be based on risk. Not everything has the same likelihood of happening. Not every prob probable cause could cause the same level of impact, so you need to make that selection and make sure that you are categorizing your assets properly, right? And this takes me to this risk-based approach for controls. Whatever your the framework that you're following, right, could be this, could be whatever, you're gonna find something very similar to this. It will have more steps, but at the very core, this is where we focus. First, as I mentioned, you need to categorize your assets, right? Once you do that. You select the controls that are appropriate to the risks that you decided that you are willing to take that the appetite of those risks. Are you going to select the controls based on the types of assets, the type of data that you have stored on those assets, what is the type of privacy that you are needing to adhere, all those things, and then you start selecting controls, and this is where we are going to focus today, right? How do we select the controls and once you select what you need, how do you actually implement those controls in AWS, OK? What are the different types of implementations that we have? And then, how do you assess how effective are those controls, right? How do you make sure that something that you implemented is actually doing what you're it is supposed to be doing and how do you actually provide your ATO's, your authorization to operate to the teams, right? And finally, once you provide that authorization, this is not something that you today and then you just forget about it, right? You need to be continuously monitoring to make sure that maybe something changed, right? And it's still following your organization guidelines and controls. And that's what continuous monitoring is key. Right? So once you go through this process, you need to go in that continuous monitoring that sometimes is the trickiest part because it's not just about monitoring, it's also about taking actions, right? If something is no longer following our guidelines, then we need to make changes to make sure that we can provide that authorization. Now, let's move into Arnot that he's gonna dive deeper into how we can actually go through the process of selection and implementation of controls. Thank you Rodolfo. I really like that approach, you know, like select, implement, assess, monitor, and I'm going to show you today how we can use control tower, it's control catalog, and a couple of new features that we recently launched to help you with the first two steps of that approach, which are the select and implement. So select the control that you need for your different use cases and deploy them at scale in your AWS organization. But let's start with a scenario that we see all the time. We have a customer that comes to us and says, Hey, I need to be PCI DSS compliant because I'm processing credit data, but I also want to be to follow like the CIS best practices because it is something that is recommended by my security team. And also, you know, like maybe in the future I'd like to follow other AWF's best practices, like cover more governance objectives, etc. And this is like a typical starting point. Multiple compliance needs, different stakeholders, various security and governance frameworks, and usually it's at that moment when organizations realized that they need a structured approach to governance and compliance in the cloud. So now that we have selected the frameworks, let's say PCIDSS and CIS. This is where it gets interesting. Each framework speaks its own language. For example, PCI at its requirements, CIS at its benchmark, and on the other side of the spectrum, AWS has a lot of managed control for different use cases. So typically what we see, what you guys do is that on your side, you're going to start to map the framework requirements to some of the control objectives that you have and then figure out what are the AWS managed controls that you can use to achieve those objectives in the context of those frameworks. So if we come back to our example, you will have to understand PCIDSS. And CIS. Then identify what you need to do for encryption at trust. And then when that is done, you're going to map those needs to NS manage controls. So it's a challenging process which takes time and resources. So let's see now how typically customers manage this today. So today most organizations Tackle these challenges with a spreadsheet. So it will mean like, OK, I'm going to do a first spreadsheet for my PCI requirements. I'm going to put in that spreadsheet the mapping with the AWS control that I have, the control that I have to author myself, so it's going to be like a big spreadsheet with thousands of rows, and you're going to have to do that again for CIS and you're going to have to repeat that process like for all the frameworks and all the objectives that you guys want to achieve, right? So. This is obviously manual, uh, time consuming, and prone to error, and we've seen customers like spend a lot of time uh just on that process, sometimes months, maintaining those uh those uh those spreadsheets. And maybe most importantly, we all know that this is not a point in time process. Like everything is evolving, so every time there is a change, for example, like there is a new version of PCI that you need to support or you want to support a new governance objective, you're going to have to go back to those Excel files, maintain them, and yeah, it takes time and a lot of energy. So OK, now let's see how the control tower and its control catalog can help you with the first two steps of our risk-based approach. Select and implement. Uh, but, uh, before we go there, let me ask you a question. How many, how many of you here today are familiar with control tower? Raise your hand. OK, cool. Quite a lot of people. I'm happy about that. And how many of you guys are familiar with its control catalog? Not so many. OK, that's great because we're going to dip into the control catalog and I hope after at the end of this session you're going to be able to see how it can help you with that governance journey. OK, but for those who are familiar with control tower, you may know that before, previously, to have access to AWS managed controlling control tower, you had to go through the set up and deployment of a full control tower landing zone. So this was like a process that was a little bit heavy and time consuming. And we heard from some customers that, OK, I have my multi-account environment already set up the way I want. I don't, I don't need control tower for that, but I really, really would like to use control tower for the for the controls. So we've launched recently a new feature which we call the control-on feature, which basically is going to be like it's going to allow you. To directly have access to the control catalog and all of its control in control tower, so it's pretty easy, super simple. You go to control tower, you click on the control catalog, and then you get access to all the controls that we that we have. Also, and there is no uh uh onboarding set up, nothing. And also you're going to be able like to search and discover the control that you need again without any onboarding. And if you find a control that you need that you want to deploy, then uh we're gonna uh we're gonna push you like through an onboarding experience that is really simple. It's basically just requiring the trusted access to your AWS organization and if you deploy uh config rules, we're going to set up a config recorder for you. So uh kind of fast and easy to access the catalog right now. All right, now let's dive a little bit into the catalog features. So first of all, it's we are talking about the collection of over 1000 AWS managed controls for a lot of different use cases, so spanning security, compliance, operation, cost management. These controls are accessible. Via the console, API and CLI, so if you need to find for a control, if you want to search the catalog, you can go to the console or use the list control API. If you want to get details on the control, you can use the get control API. If you want to know what control is mapped to compliant to compliance frameworks, you can you can use the list control mapping APIs. So all those APIs and console experience gives you a really easy way to search the catalog. Each control in the catalog has a global arm, so you can think of it as a unique identifier that will work across your entire AWS organization. Every control, and that's important, is deployable through AWS control tower. So this means that you get a single pane of glass to manage all your controls regardless of their origin or purpose. We've also enriched all the controls in the catalog with consistent metadata, so you're going to get a domain for each control, a command control, which is kind of a category for the control, and the objective that the control is going to achieve. So it makes it much more easier for you to understand what each control does and why you might need it. And perhaps something Most important for compliance focused team is that all the controls in the catalog have been pre-mapped to 17 compliance frameworks, so we choose like the most popular ones like PCI, uh, NIT, uh, ESO, um, and other ones. All right, uh, so, As I said before, you know, like, All the controls in the in the in the catalog like cover a lot of different use cases such as like security operation cost management, but we also have in the catalog all the different types of control that we have in AWS as you might know, in AWS we have preventive controls, proactive controls, and detective controls, and all those types of control are represented in the catalog. So now let's dive into those different types of controls. So in AWS, as I said, we have 3 types of control, the preventive ones, the proactive and the detective, and each of those types has its own primitive. So if we start with the preventive controls. You can think of these controls as the first line of defense, you know, they stop noncompliant actions to happen before anything is deployed. And for the preventive controls you have 3 primitive. So the first one is that I'm going to talk about is the security service control policy, or SCPs. So these are the controls at the AWS organization level. You can imagine them as a protective boundary around your edible organization. For example, you know, an SCP can prevent anyone in your organization from launching resources in unauthorized regions or block the creation of a 3 buckets. And the beauty here is that even if someone in your organization has admin rights on an account, they will not be able to violate those policies. The second type of preventive controls that we have on the platform are resource control policies or RCPs. So these policies worked at the resource level, and they allow you to define permission and restriction for specific AWS resources. For instance, you can ensure that all EBS volumes must be encrypted or that ETS instances can only use approved EMIs. RCPs are powerful because, you know, like like. Because they will help maintain consistent resource configuration without requiring requiring any IM policy changes. And the last primitive for primitive controls are the declarative policies. So these policies operate at the service level within an NABS organization, and they allow you to define and enforce desired desired configuration across your entire organization. What makes these policies particularly useful is that they will always work as the service as new service features are released, so you put it once, you forget, and it will always work. Unlike SCPs which control API access, declarative policies focus on maintaining consistent service configuration at scale across your organization. So with the preventive control, you are sure that once it's implemented, you're always compliant. Then we have the detective controls. So these are like the config rule-based controls. They don't prevent actions to happen, but alert you when something doesn't align with your policies. So it can be, for example, a AWS config rules that will check for noncompliance resources or a security hub control that will monitor for security-based practices. So with those you get like a status compliant, noncompliant, and if it's not compliant, then you can act on it and remediate the issue. And finally we have like the proactive controls. So these are controls that validate resources before they are deployed. They are based on cloud formation hook and examine resources during the build and deploy phases to ensure that you meet your security and governance requirements. For example, a proactive control can validate that an EC2 instance configuration include required tag. And security group before the instance is created. OK, so now, and again with those controls in your pipeline, you're going to make sure that everything that is deployed is aligned with your policies. So now you could say, OK, it's cool. There are a lot of things there, but what type of control should I use? And the recommendation that we have is that you should use all the three types together preventive and proactive to stop non-bad actions and detective control to catch anything that could slip through. And if you do that, you will really create a comprehensive governance strategy for your AWS environment. And with control catalog, and we'll see that a little bit later in the demo, we're going to help you establish that preventive detective strategy, kind of like belt and suspender. But for now, back to Rodolfo for another important use case, governance use case, which is AWS service approval. Thank you, Honor. Alright, so, as we just saw, a lot of other controls, there are different types and with controls catalog, we can, we just saw how we can align those using the mapping that is aligned to 17 frameworks, right? But what happens with, we get our developers and we get our all, all our business owners saying, hey, I wanna leverage this particular AWS service, right? I wanna get that into production. So that's in our approval process, right, because we need controls for that particular service to allow us to allow that to be in production, right? It has to align to our strategy that we saw and we discussed at the beginning, right? And we see our customers working with mainly 3 ways to address this. The first one is a blanket approval approach. This is something that we're gonna dive deeper in a second, but this is the, the first thing that we see our customers trying to do, right? The second one, and is basically like an enhancement on the first one. So this is a contextual service approval, right? We're gonna also uh discuss that in a second, and the last one is a hybrid, two-stage approval for every service, right? So let's take a look on how this actually looks like. Let's go from one business scenario, and this is the blanket approval approach. We have our product team saying, hey, I have a new feature that is gonna work with no SQL data. I looked at Dynamo TV. It looks like something pretty cool. I would like to use that. Let's start working on that and this is gonna be for this particular data storage functionality. It's a new feature that we're gonna launch, uh, and we get that request, er, from the service, er, from the service, from the product team to the central security team, right? So in this particular case, we get the request and say, yeah, because we are using blanket approval approach right now, we just checked and Dynamo DB is not on the allow list, right? So we need to start working on that. So, let's review the service and let's see how it fits in the context of your new workload, but then because we're using blanket approval, that means that if we approve it, it's gonna be allowed for any other team that wants to use it. And of course, as we just also discussed at the beginning, not every workload is the same, so that will get complex, right? Because you are evaluating the the new service on the context of this feature, but then how do you know that it's gonna fit every every future use case? So that comes Actually becomes a pretty complex er task to to to follow and actually, you can arguably say that it's impossible, right? Because what happens if something new comes out, so it is hard to align. So, but we see customers trying to do this at the very beginning and then they say, no, let's let's take a look at something different, right? And here's when we start seeing in context contextual service approval. So we have the same request, yeah, we wanna use Dynamo DB but in this particular case, we ask the product team to say, yeah, let's do a threat model exercise, right? To see what are the different scenarios that could affect this, how are how are we aligning to our strategy, and then just discuss this. Uh, service in the context of this workload, right? And that means that if it gets approved, it will get approved only for this, right? On the context of this. If it gets, uh, disproved, right, then it will get blocked for not just everyone, it will just get denied for this particular context, right? So it's way better, right? And the good thing with this is that it it allows you to keep evolving, right? Because based on this review and how it differs from the base lining, I will allow this for this, but in the future, they can use a similar threat model, right? You just add whatever you think that you will need on the new in the in the new feature in a different context. So this is the most common approach that we see. Now, The third one is when we look at highly regulated industries that need to align, for example, the compliance program. And for this one, I'm totally, almost 100% sure that a lot of you are already familiar with this. This is just a quick review on the shared responsibility model of AWS. So keeping this in mind, right? AWS takes care of the res uh of the security of the cloud, right? The the one in the bottom, right? The one that is in orange. And this is basically making sure that the hardware is secure and we don't say that. We are, you have to take our word for it, right? We are actually work with multiple compliance programs across the globe. We have third-party auditors that came and and do audits like twice a year in our environments. There are there are ways for you to download those reports, right? To make agreements through AWS artifacts, and we're gonna discuss that later. And then we give you evidence that this is compliant, right? So if you are trying to, let's say follow PCI DSS standards, you can also make sure that you are leveraging services from AWS that are aligning to this program and this is actually helps you relieve that part of Possibility that is on on your side, the security in the cloud, right? Access controls, data encryption, all those things that you are putting in place in our services, you are making sure that you can align to that and this is the hybrid two-stage approach because we get the same request from the product team and we say, OK, this is gonna be a workload that is handling payment card data, right? So this needs to align to PCI DSS. AWS is already giving me proof that this is aligned to PC IDSS, so Dynom LDB is pre-approved, and then we just need to review that context part that we just saw, but in the context only of my shared responsibility, making sure that I'm also applying the controls that I need to do this, right? So this is a a key part, this is what we normally recommend our customers to take, right? But then once you decide all this and then you say, OK, I need all these controls, that's when you say, OK, which controls and how can I do that, right? So this is when I'm gonna go back to Arnold to see how he actually leverage the the controls catalog to not just align our controls to frameworks but also to specific services, right? Depending on what I decided that I need. So back to you Arnold, thank you. Thanks Rodolfo. So, um, so let's go back to our previous scenario. So you need to be PCIDSS compliant and you also want to follow CIS best practices. So now let's say that uh you need to ensure encryption at rest in your organization and you want to start protecting your Amazon Dynamo DB databases. So enough words and let's see how control catalog can help you with that. So as I said, you know, like now when you arrive in control tower, no need to set up landing zone. You can directly go to the control catalog. You can see that we have a bunch of controls for a lot of different use cases. You can see every control with the name, the service of the control, so we are supporting like a bunch of different services. The common control that the control applies to. And to come back to the previous discussion, we can see that we have detective, proactive and preventive control in the catalog, and you know, like the, the type of implementation, implementation like config rules, cloud formation, hooks control, or SCPs. You can also browse the catalog by different dimensions, so you can go like and look at specific control objectives, for example, backup and recovery, logging. Encryption address where we have 78 controls for that to help you with that. As Rodolph O just mentioned, you can also like go like with a service specific approach and look at all the controls that we have, for example, for RDS or S3. And use those uh to approve AWS services or to come back to our example like uh you can uh want you might want to to have a framework based approach so we see like all the framework that we are supporting here with all the controls that are related to that framework. OK, now if I go back to the catalog and let's go into the details of one control. For example, let's say that we want to have a 3 bucket notification enabled. So this is like the detail of a control. You can understand with the description of a control what it's going to do. You can see at the domain, um, which is shits and er the objective, for example, of the control, like the different categories the control is er is mapped to, and er the different frameworks the control is mapped to. The service for the control, the resource that the control is controlling. It's a detective control that we have here from security hub that is deployable in 17 regions. That's the date of the release, and something interesting I wanted to show you here is that That control, we kind of see that it's mapped. It's related to another control which is a proactive control, and it's kind of like it means that that detective control and that proactive control can work together to have the detective and the proactive behavior. So you're going to see that that control is really, really similar to the config rules detective control that we were looking at before, but it's a proactive one. Right? Obviously like if you go to the relationship, you're going to see that that proactive control is related to the config rules. And what is interesting is that you can choose to enable those two controls together to have the detective and proactive protection. So now let's go back to our example PCIDSS and CIS for encryption address for your Amazon Dynamo DB. So what is really interesting is that I can filter the catalog by all the dimensions that I that I want to find the controls that I need. So I'm going to. Asked to give me like the PCIDSS 4.0 controls. I'm going to do the same for CIS. And you can do that for like whatever like the needs that you have. So CIS 8.0. So now I get like the intersection of the controls of the two the two frameworks, and I want to Ensure encryption at rest. So I'm going to do like a filtering with encrypt data at rest, and I want to start with my Amazon Dana Modibi. So I'm going to filter by the service Dynamo DB. And Voila, I have 5 controls that can help me with my encryption address for my Dynamo DB table. Let's say that I want to use KMS keys for that, so I'm going to choose that detective control, but I see that I have like a similar control at the bottom here, which is a proactive one that is exactly the same behavior but with a With a proactive control and detective control, so I can select those two controls, decide to enable them. Now I'm gonna Let's say I want to protect all my dynamo. Databases in my workload OU, so I choose that workload OU and then I just start the enablement of those two controls for all the accounts in that in that OU. So we can see that. The two controls are enabling now. And after a couple of minutes, We're going to have the 2 controls enabled in my workload OU, which means that In a few steps, like I'm sure that all my dynamo DB tables in my workload or use are encrypted that trust with KMS. So job done. So it was kind of quick and easy, and obviously you can repeat that process for all the other AWS services, control objectives, and compliance frameworks you need to support in your organization. So I hope you like the demo. Give it a try. It's easy and smooth. Just go to control tower and you can start exploring the control catalog, and that's it for the select and implement phases of our risk-based approach. And now back to Rodolfo that we'll talk about an important use case which is, OK, what should I do if I don't have a managed control in the catalog for something that I want to protect. Thank you, thank you. Alright, so, as we just saw again, there is a catalog with over 1000 controls available. These are pre-created, easy to deploy, but you know, every organization is different and we understand that there are specific baseline specific to your systems, right? How do you do that? So besides preventative and besides proactive controls, you can actually deploy detective controls that are outside the catalog. And for this we use AWS config. AWS config allows you to have two types of controls, both detectives. One is managed controls, that is basically those rules that are actually part of the catalog already. And then we have custom controls, right? How you can create your own controls to basically make sure that you are following or making sure that you are aligning to maybe an outlier or something very specific that requires some exceptions and how you can do that through AWS config. So with custom controls basically are those custom rules and there are two main ways to do that. One is a lambda based approach. You can actually create a landmda and make sure that you have it has the proper permissions, the proper, let's say, uh, coding that are used in Python, for example, and how can it align, can it align to whatever you are trying to do and you can deploy that from config. Uh, we understand that that sometimes is kinda hard, right? For those folks that are not that familiar with developing. Um, so we have an open-source tool that is called the root er Development kit. So this RDK is basically an open source tool that customers can leverage to create a boilerplate of the lambda and test the control locally and then deploy that centrally. And you just need to focus on the logic of whatever you're trying to do, right? If you wanna check one specific, uh, let's say version on an EKS cluster, you can do that, you just need to focus on the logic and then you and then you can deploy that. Then the other option is guard DSL. This is a domain specific language where you just need to focus on the policy itself of the compliance, uh, requirement that you have, and you basically, this is leverage, uh, guard DSL from cloud formation, the same logic, and you can just from the console or from the CLI from an API you can say, hey, this is the policy that I need to evaluate, forget about all the the things that are happening around it, er. AWS config will take care of it and will deploy that custom control on your behalf. This allows you to deploy it in multiple ways. It allows you to be flexible, right, because it aligns to whatever custom requirement you have and it's also CLI based. You can actually work with that. And to that point, you can go even further simplifying this. So with Quiro CLI, this is a generative AI, uh, service that we have in AWS. This allows you to actually install Qiro, right? This is gonna be like your assistant. And you can ask them questions in plain English and actually help get Kro CLI to help you create these rules, right? So if you have AWSCLI you install Kiro CLI and if you even install the RDK you basically have everything you need. And you can just go ahead from the console and say, hey, Kiiro, help me create a config rule that checks if I'm running a specific DKS version that I don't want to have, right? Just detect me if something is there. So it will leverage the RDK that is already there there in that environment, so you basically don't need to learn it and then it will create that boilerplate is the section that is in black and red on the on the top and it will just actually take that embed the logic that you ask them to follow. And then once that's done, actually it will help you deploy that if you give the the the assistant permissions enough. So it will give you the steps to deploy and even though if you wanna go further, you can actually deploy that from the console. So this is pretty, pretty cool, actually. I've started using it a lot so I highly recommend for you to test this. uh, it's definitely uh a better way to do this, so now you If you have the RDK if you wanna do this. We have NCP servers for knowledge on AWS that Quiro can connect to, so it gives you that context on AWS and actually pro even do further stuff. So this allows you to actually have those customized controls that we just discussed, right, that you may need already. This is an example of guard DSL. This is also a custom, uh, custom rule that I just created, as you can see, it's basically just checking the metadata of the resource, saying, hey, if it is one, something different than 1.34, if it is uh EKS version beyond that, just let me know and I will take an action. Integrates with, uh, cloud Watch log groups, so this means that it will let you know if it is actually following. Best practices and you can see at the execution. So in this particular case, it's giving me 1.28. It's not what I expected, so that's why it's giving me that it's not compliant, right? And moving from this, we go into the final steps, assessment and monitoring, right? So we just go on how we select, how do we implement, how do we build custom controls. So let's take a look on which services config, control tower, and security hub helps me. With that part, with that final steps, assessing assessment and monitoring. So this is the same environment that we just saw with Arnot. This is identity center. These are just the accounts that I have. If I go to my management account, this is where you will see control tower, right? And we just saw how you can see the catalog from here. We go to control tower here. You will see the main dashboard is telling me that I have 2 organizational units and I have 24 accounts. I have 26 controls deployed, 21 preventive, 4 detective, and 1 proactive. These are actually the controls that Arnold just deployed. We can see that we have non-compliant resource. And we're gonna take a look on that. We have 4 OUs and we have 1 OU that is non-compliant, and we're gonna see what is happening with that. We have enroll accounts, we see that there is a workload, one name account that is non-compliant. We click on that account, we're gonna get the details of that account. We're gonna see related non-compliant resources. This is where we see the dynamo D table, remember that we just deployed a detective control that checks. If this is being encrypted with KMS keys, it's telling me, yeah, that you have a non-compliant resource in here you can see the enable controls that are part of that account, you will see that you have your SEPs and you have your detective controls. You will see the regions this account is operated on, right? And right now we have 4 regions, all the other ones are non-governed. That means that control tower is not looking at them and you can actually avoid workloads from being deployed there if you want. You will see other security hub rules and we're gonna see what are those in a second, but let's just focus on this non-compliant control that we just deployed in Dynamo. If you click on the control that we deployed, you're gonna see, as we just saw the domain, it's gonna tell me like all the mapping, all the things that we did when we actually pushed that into production. It's gonna tell me the data protection, is gonna give me the frameworks. It's gonna give me all that data that we just saw from the catalog itself. It's gonna tell me where it is deployed and also from here you can also see what Arnold just showed us the related controls, OK? Here I can move. OK, this is noncompliant. What else I have? I see that there is a proactive control, but keep in mind that this proactive control works with infrastructure as code, right? If I try to deploy something, OK, I have a cloud formation template that I'm trying to deploy. There is a rule that it was already created in the vacuum, right? We didn't see any of this when we were deploying the control because you don't have to be worried about that part. Here, if you go to enable controls, you can see the whole thing, you can actually filter by the, in this case, let's say proactive controls, and this is telling me that this control is enabled, where is it enabled, what are the frameworks that are related to it. And again I can see recent operations. I can see when something changed, when it was enabled, even though I can actually check if something was disabled, right? So this is my main, uh, say dashboard for those kind of controls. If we move into the audit account, right, this is our security services account in this particular case. If we go to AWS config, remember that in the back end config is actually powering detective controls in control tower, right? Here we're also gonna have a dashboard. The inventory is key component, right, because this is basically the list of assets allows you to have your rules in here. You will see that you have multiple rules in here. There are multiple that are non-compliant and this is because we also deploy security hub rules and we're and we're gonna look on what those are as well. We can see actually the resource inventory, you can filter in here, for example by non-compliant resource in this particular account, right, in the security services account. In this case, I have an S3 bucket. It's telling me that it has some non-compliance rules even though some checks are being passed, uh, and we're gonna take a look uh how we can actually look at those. We can see the attributes of this particular resource, OK. This is the whole metadata you can explore that if you need it. Uh, this is actually what is been happening in the back end. All the data that is being gathered for this resource. It gives you the resource timeline as you can see. I can see when it changed from compliant to non-compliant or vice versa. I can see if somebody made a change because cloud trail is also part of config so it gives you that historical, uh, context of something that is happening so I can see when that happened and I can actually take a look on that, right. Very powerful. Now I was showing you one single account. In config you can have aggregators, so that means within in an aggregator you can actually run queries, right? In aggregator is basically everything put together. If you say show me all non-compliant resources, but I'm using the aggregator for my whole organization, so it's gonna run a query, it's pre-populated, you can change that if you need it. And then it will give you all the different types of resources, all the rules that are associated to that resource that might be giving you a non-compliant status. You can actually just take a look at that and make action. But of course, this is one way to do it in config, uh, but again, Let's move into security hub, right? Because it's very important that you have non-compliance and you have those historical changes and you have the resource inventory, but you need also the security context, right? So if we go to security hub, Security hub allows you to deploy managed frameworks, not just controls individually, but also deploy, let's say, a whole CIS framework, and I can do that. It will aggregate me the data so you can quickly take a look on this. You can say, OK, by accounts, by specific instances I can have my findings, security findings that are related to misconfiguration, for example, on all my regions. Remember that we saw that we are operating in 4 regions, right? Is giving me all these findings based on the thread, er, changes over time, er resources with the most amount of changes, so this is like the executive summary, right? You can actually use this dashboard for that. If you go into the controls, you will have a score, 77% of all the controls that are deployed. This means that I have 492 findings of those controls in different resources. I can actually filter. Down to a specific, let's say, requirements and concerns that I have, I can try to try to prioritize. Let's look at a critical one, right? What that is, I see this is a particular security group that is open, right? Something that I deploy a a a control that is associated to a framework. I see that I have plenty of accounts that are have no issues with security groups, but there is maybe one. That I would like to focus if I filter by compliance status, I see that I want to fail and this is because there is a security group that is open on that account. So I can actually start doing things and getting that context related to a misconfiguration that is not just something that is non-compliant, it's also that it is a security risk, right? So this is why we focus on those objectives at the beginning, right? This is the security case. We can see the overall organization deployment. I can see the same as we saw in control tower, but this is from a security standpoint of the policies of security hub CSPN. This is the cloud security posture management part. I can see that I have 3 frameworks that I deployed using security hub controls. All the relationships I can go into the insights. It will generate insights that are pre-populated that you can actually take a look on. You can actually go to findings again, this is another window to focus on findings with context. I see that I have an EKS cluster over there with the critical, er, let's say finding. If I click on it, it's gonna give me the overview. It's gonna give me the resource data again. Config is pushing all that data we just saw into security hub as well, so you're gonna have the resource history. You're gonna have the compliance history from here that actually aggregates to a specific control. You can actually take actions from there. You change the status of the finding, you can actually export the finding if you need it to a third party tool as well. You can add notes, you can further investigate if you need it, using something like detective in case you have that enabled, a very, very powerful content that you can get from security hub CSPN now. Let's look at security hub. This is a new experience that we launched, and this gives you not just the misconfiguration part, but it aggregates data from other services to give you more context. This is the executive summary. It's telling me that I have re finding trends in this particular case, the last 90 days. I have exposure findings. I'm gonna explain that real quick, what that means. And you can actually filter by days. Last week, this was last week, last week when I recorded this, so you can actually see the coverage, right? Security posture management 100% because we use control tower with security hub to deploy those controls, right? We go to the tri triage, we are gonna see that we have threat summary and we have expose, uh, exposure summary, and we have 4 million findings in there. So if I actually wanna take a look at those to see what that means, right? Is giving me something that I have some specific things that I need to be concerned of, but why is that, right? Why that means that it is exposed? If I look at those, if I actually see a potential hijacking to an easy to instance, it's telling me that yeah, you have an EKS cluster as a primary resource. It's being highlighted because this is accessible, right? And I can see the traits, the traits that are actually contributing to this finding. The first one is telling me that it is reachable from the internet. And then it's telling me that it's misconfigured and this is actually a control, remember? We have a control that is looking for EKS versions of clusters. So this is telling me that I have a non-supported EKS version that is actually publicly accessible. So that's a concern, right? So I can see the compliance history and all of that is being enabled by those detective controls that I have in place. Uh, anything that you can actually do from here, you can explore the finding again, this is exposure finding, you can actually change the status of it. You can investigate that. And in this particular case, as we saw we have 3 that are funded in this demo environment. I have like those security groups that might be a concern, uh, an easy to again that has a vulnerability and also has an open security group, so it's the same, right? So that those detective controls are actually checking the configuration of that security group and also I have inspector running the back end. This is another service that's telling me that there is a known CV. So I aggregating not just those controls that allows me to be compliant but I'm giving you the service chances to actually assess how effective those controls are actually being deployed and how it can actually be continuously monitoring those things, right? So it gives me those contextual threads and again in this particular case it's telling me that there is a misconfiguration because again, we're focusing on that control of that configuration use case but really powerful things you can actually see the treats, the traits, I'm sorry, and you can actually feel that. The last piece that I wanna show you in here is the actual attack path, so This is a potential attack path that is based on those findings. I have an EC-2. I have a security group. I have the EC2. What it's finding is is telling me in here that I have a vulnerability because this is this to instance has known CVEs and I have a security group that is associated through with that misconfiguration, one of those controls. So it's telling me that I have that exact concern. And again, all the data of that resource is here that I can explain why that it is highlighting. As, as, as an example in there, all right? All right, so, Let's move into auditing. The last part. We just saw how we can assess and how we can monitor. Really quick, uh, to wrap up is how do you actually do this with AWS services. The first one is AWS artifact, right? As we just saw at the beginning, the shared responsibility model. Allows me to actually trust in AWS. How do you actually download those reports? This is through AWS artifact. This is free. You go into the console, you actually accept, and you can download the reports, let's say, for PCI DSS, those third party audit reports that we have, you can automate that, download those every single time there is a new version, you can download the latest one, and then you can actually even accept agreements if you are operating on that landscape, for example. Cloud trail, it has a cloud trail lake service. This is a managed data lake for audit events, uh, allows you to have all these aggregated data. In this particular case, you can actually use a generative AI capabilities to ask plain questions. In this case, show me all the mutated events in config in the in the last couple of months. It generates a query for you. Gives you, in this particular case, this is a smaller environment, I have only 4, it's summarizing those findings, it's telling me what changed and what is basically the explanation of the aggregation of those API calls. It also generates pre-populated dashboards so you can actually look at those uh in an organizational way. And then you have of course AWS config as we just saw, it will also have compliance dashboards and also you can export your snapshots into, let's say, quick suite dashboards that we create using Quick sights and generative AI capabilities. There is one that you can download in here if you wanna actually just have something pre-populate, uh, from config. You can actually do that as well. So, key takeaways for this. Remember to start based on your objectives. Work backwards from that to define a strategy, right? Implement a risk-based approach, right? You wanna make sure that you are basing everything on your appetite of risk and using a managed framework for it. Leverage as much as you can manage services that will ease a lot of the pain, and you don't have to learn every single thing. It will give you automation around that and hopefully it will actually address all the concerns that you may have and and gives you a place to start. At the start, we remember that we talked about the analogy of how controls are your hidden architecture for your building. When you start a construction, you wanna make sure that you have a well-defined plan. It's the same with governance. It's the same with controls. You need to define that from the beginning so you have a clear path moving forward. So that's the key. Um, and that's pretty much it. We really would like to thank you for your time. I know that this was a long session. Uh, these are some additional resources you wanna go and take a closer look into resources, blogs, er, about controls, security hub controls. Feel free to take a look on that, and Very important. If you wanna discuss more, um come by by the kiosk of governance, er, we have, we have goodies, we have stickers, and we have experts in there. If you wanna dive deeper in any of this. And last but not least, please remember to fill out the survey. Feedback is very important and have a nice weekend. Have a nice reinvent. Welcome. Thank you.
