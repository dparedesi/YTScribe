summary: "This session, titled \"Autonomous Enterprise: Redefining the Future of Business with AI\" (BIZ101), features Rajev from Digitate and Todd Carey from AWS, who present the transformative concept of \"autonomous enterprise operations\" via the Igneo platform as a critical solution for eliminating IT-induced business disruptions. Rajev begins by sharing three compelling case studies that illustrate the tangible impact of technology failures on business outcomes: Tapestry, a premium retail company that faced potential revenue loss during Black Friday when order processing issues occurred across its 37 global storefronts; a Medtech company manufacturing prosthetic limbs where data integration challenges across 70 disparate interfaces prevented them from confirming delivery dates for urgent surgeries; and a retail scenario involving missed stock replenishment during a high-demand T20 cricket match. He argues that underneath these business problems lies a common failure of IT systems to perform as designed, prompting the need for a shift to an autonomous operating model. The Igneo platform addresses this by providing \"unified observability,\" a framework that maps the entire business process—from order to cash—horizontally while simultaneously monitoring the underlying vertical technology stack, including SAP systems, cloud services, and legacy applications. This dual visibility ensures that when a business discrepancy occurs, such as a delayed order or a missing manifest, the system can instantly pinpoint the specific technical component at fault. The platform's capabilities are categorized into three core functions: Comprehensive Observability to bridge the gap between business flows and IT infrastructure, AI-driven Insights that leverage telemetry and log data to predict failures before they impact operations—such as forecasting that a sales reconciliation report will be missed hours in advance—and Closed-Loop Automation that can isolate and resolve unanticipated problems at machine speed. Rajev offers a detailed look at the architecture behind Igneo, which is built on a sophisticated multi-agent system comprising five key agents: Perception, Reasoning, Action, Learning, and Control, supplemented by an LLM-based agent for analytical support. These agents operate on both \"deterministic\" models (for logical reasoning and known fixes) and \"analogical\" models (using LLMs for broader context), working continuously to execute over 10,000 pre-built automated actions. This setup allows the platform to reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR) from hours of manual triage across siloed teams to just minutes of automated remediation. The session highlights Digitate's massive scale, managing over 34,000 workloads globally and processing 1.2 billion events annually with 87% noise reduction. Todd Carey from AWS joins to emphasize the strategic partnership, noting that Igneo's availability on the AWS Marketplace, including a new integration with BMC Control-M, represents the next generation of delivering immediate outcomes. He reinforces that the combination of Digitate’s autonomous capabilities and AWS’s scalable infrastructure allows enterprises to move from reactive fire-fighting to proactive operations, significantly accelerating time-to-value."

Thanks guys. Appreciate it. Yeah Good afternoon everyone and in the next uh 20 minutes we are going to talk about how to uh. Change the future of business how we do through the autonomous enterprise operations. Uh, uh, the way we structure the discussion for next 20 minutes is, uh, uh, then Todd will come and talk about as a partnership what we are doing together with, uh, AWS. Uh, just before we start the presentation, I want to thank one of my customers, uh, you know, here from Kenview. He's a vice president, uh, from Kenview, and they're, uh, user of IgEO. Thank you very much for being our customer. Uh, Praveen has been a great, uh, help, and any one of you who wants to discuss with him post the event, he would be happy to spend some time. Uh, this morning, today also, we announced a partnership with uh Control-M. Which is the first inaugural launch along with AWS on the marketplace as a multi-product, uh, SAS which I launched today. Uh, go and check it out, but coming to this presentation, we'll just talk about three stories, uh, what we are doing that will give you a sense of what, how the customers are, uh, using those, and then we'll tell you what the product is about. Then we'll solve the story and then hand it over to, uh, Todd. So, um This is a, I'm sure somebody can recognize it's a premium retail company, tapestry, the bags which some of you might have seen used it. They had an issue where some of the orders are not reaching on time, not being processed, not being fulfilled, not delivered on time. It's a loss of revenue, loss of experience. Another example we'll talk about is this company which is in the medtech space. They manufacture prosthetic limbs, and if those limbs, the commit date to the surgery room in the hospital is not confirmed, the surgery may not happen and the patient may not get their limbs. And the third example is, uh, let's say in Bangalore there's a cricket match going on, a T20 cricket match, and a lot of the retailers nearby are stocking so that they feel that they will have a lot of sales going on and that sales, the stock is not fulfilled because there's some certain glitch because the intended CPG company is not able to fulfill those because of certain order processing issues. In all the three examples. There is something common as a business problem underneath somewhere the IT did not perform the way it was designed to perform, and that's the challenge we see we all know across when the business calls you that look something did not work my order did not get processed and you see IT problem has happened so majority of the business problem today what you see is a technology issue and that's what we're trying to solve and make it autonomous in the industry. Uh, if you look at the example of tapestry which I talked about. Their challenge was they have 37 different storefronts. They operate globally. Orders come through those storefronts. They have an order management system. They have a fulfillment process. They have a financial transaction to close, and then the shipping happens. And in the whole journey, if you look at the different hops where the data flow through different systems as a technology layer and within some of the application itself, for example, SAP systems and other systems. And in that journey of the data flow we have deployed the unified observability to ensure that every hop the business knows exactly how the order is processing and if something goes wrong at the layer of technology, the technology team also knows which component of technology has failed or not performed to the expectation and that's why that problem has been created and in all this area if you see. This problem has resulted, and we have, you know, some data which I'll share to you this morning which came from the last week itself because last week was a very heightened activity because of Black Friday sales and what was going on everywhere in the world. In the last one week they processed more than a million orders and if Igneo was not there, almost worth $3 million worth of their orders either would not have been processed, they might have been delayed. Or they might have been canceled by the consumers because they might not have made the promised date. So that's the value what we are bringing in this situation where we are bringing the unified obserability across the process flow from order to cash and underlying technology vertically from the tech perspective to ensure the operational autonomy is involved and delivered to them every day, every time order comes through. The second example which I talked about, the challenge was this company grew through acquisition several years. It's a long-standing brand. They build, as I said, prosthetic limbs. They're across the supply chain and demand planning specifically. They have to. Confirm a promised date for a specific limb to a patient and to the surgeon, and if you look at that area, it's very, uh, you know, humble to speak about that because you need 4 things. You need a doctor, you need a hospital, you need a patient, and you need a limb. All three are available. The limb is not available. The promised date is not there. That's the challenge that customer had where this order flow of data was happening through. There were 70 different interfaces because they have grown through acquisition, different applications, different kinds, SAS, on-premise, antiquated, you know, legacy application all running through those systems. That's what we have. So for them where the data flow happens, the demand planning process for them has been reduced from weeks to now hours, and they're able to promise the date to the hospitals so that the surgery can happen, and that's what is a big help not only to my customer here, but it's also to the end user because that's very important for their life. The 3rd example. I talked about, you know, it's an example where, I know, I'm some of you who work in the retail or CPG industry, the direct store delivery is a very, very critical process for some of the CPG companies and in that process. Typically route sales would go take the orders, see the stock on the shelf, understand what is required, how it's selling, punch in some orders there. That order flows through different systems, comes to the CPT company, to their manufacturing units, and shipped through the truck goes and it directly stock on the shelf. That is a very high frequency process where if you miss or order is not delivered, as simple as a manifest has not been generated and your truck may not fill the full orders and move. You have lost two parts in that process. First of all, the shelf is empty for the retailer. The retailer has not only lost the revenue and the CPG company associated revenue, but you also lose the brand and the market share, and it's a very, very competitive market. So on that journey, on the business value, what we're monitoring, what we call it, on the whole journey of right from the order taker to the manufacturing plant to the shipping fulfillment and the restocking, the whole journey we have mapped on IGNO, which is the platform from the state to ensure on a weekly basis we process a couple of $100 million of orders on this platform to ensure it moves autonomously in the journey. Now these 3 stories are from a different kind I talked about, you know, it matters as a business underneath all this. Real solution real life solution is the technology which is the problem, and I'll come to the next part how we are solving this problem today. So as I said, autonomous is the new operating model, how we are delivering that value, and I'm sure some of you who comes from the IT background. You all want to eliminate business disruption, which happens because of IT. A lot of business folks call you and say, look, I gave you all the tools. Why did this happen again? The second party want to still do if we can't fix those problems proactively, that I should know first as an IT before business partner knows, and I can tell them in advance that I know it, we are fixing it. If you can't do that, the last and the least part you can do is, if I know somebody called me a problem has been there, can I recover as fast as possible that the problem feels like a blip. And to achieve these three elements in the order of priority, we have built a platform called IgEO which has three broad things. One is the fiber sility, which I talked about from the horizontal observ to understand the layer of data processing which happens through different applications, and the underlying vertical stack observability to understand how the problem occurs and proactively create a visibility and avoid those problems from happening in the first place. We also hook up on the second part which he talked about the AI driven inside. We hook up with a lot of telemetry data which log data and other elements which come from the environment through your monitoring tools to understand what what can happen and we can predict what's going to fail, for example. This application, the way the usage is increasing, 6 weeks from now, the performance of this service is going to degrade. It gives you some latitude to understand what's going on. A bad job cycle. It can tell you 3 a.m. in the morning and say, look, by 6 a.m. your sales reconciliation report is not going to come. You will miss that KPI. That's what this air driven insight gives you the time so that you can recover from those situations before the problem has already hit you. And the third part is. Problems do occur, we recognize, and that's where the closed loop automation comes, where a problem has resurfaced. I understands the context. It understands the whole hierarchical model of your enterprise as an IT blueprint, and it can recover and isolate the problem at a machine speed which typically today a lot of environment today, all the enterprise customers, they put teams which are siloed in nature, they come together. Typically, first time they will say the network guys, they're the fault. Eventually they come down to some database guy and say, look, the long running query is the problem, they fix it. It takes maybe 11 to 2 to 4 hours. That's where it runs at a machine speed, isolate the problem. And then we have built almost 10,000 automated actions to take action to fix this problem within minutes. So that situation, which takes maybe an hour, 2 hours, 5 hours to fix, can be solved in a couple of minutes, maybe sometimes 3 minutes, sometimes 10 minutes. All these three elements of the capability that we have built on this platform. I applied to your cloud operations, your Typical data center, if you have a data center in your environment, custom applications, SAP systems, bad jobs, and and devices like laptops and desktops, and that pretty much covers your 80 to 90% of operations and that's what our vision has been to go behind this and make all the journey autonomous so that the business can perform the way it's supposed to perform. And to deliver all this, what we have is these 5 agents. The whole architecture is agentic. If you look at some of the Personas which we deal in the enterprise today, the SREs persona, the CXO personas, you know, a lot of cloud operation which goes on, a lot of IT operations team handles, and their objectives, which I've talked about, it's very clear, move as fast as you could, avoid, eliminate the incidents, and these five agents work in a very simple principle that they can work on their own, and these agents are. Made through 6 sub agents, all agents are through a perception agent, a reasoning agent, an action agent, and a learning agent. And we also have built a control agent and an LLM-based model agent so that it augment some of the teams because maybe Igio does not have the full knowledge, 100% knowledge of everything goes into the enterprise. So what we have built here from the agentic platform perspective, not only a deterministic model where it can go and fix certain problems from the logical reasoning perspective, but it can also take something analytical model through your LLMs we use one of the other platform from an LLM today and that we can bring it together from the logical analogical model to fix the problems what goes on in your enterprise. So on that note, just to give you some data points today, we are very focused on the global 2000 customers. We believe enterprise is the segment where we thrive well. The impact of the value of this platform is much higher. The the value they derive is much bigger. We are almost managing 34,2 workload globally in 20 different regions. We process almost 1.2 billion events on this platform with almost 87% noise reduction. Just imagine the help it gives to the command center team everywhere. We almost have 300 million plus automation which is working today on the platform every year and of course we are compliant to certain standards, global standards which any enterprise needed today, SOC 2, Type 2, and others. And of course on that journey. AWS has been a great partner as I talked about, we have launched today morning with uh BMC Control-M, but I'll ask uh Todd to talk about some of the partnership what we have gone through in the last several years. Sure, thanks, thanks, Rajev. Great stuff. So, uh, good afternoon. My name is Todd Carey. Uh, I lead our GSP sales teams worldwide and then, and really that's two main areas is, is looking at our biggest partners and strategic partners as customers. Also as investors and sellers and how we go to market together and that really is responding to a lot of the market signals, the things that we see, things that customers demand, so it's it's amazing to hook up with partners like Digitate to where they're looking at things, they're building things, but most importantly they're delivering things and when we feel like delivering things like outcomes when we start talking about on time deliveries, weeks to hours. Full trucks, you know, these are use cases that end customers really want to hear about and in fact just as important as our field sales teams want to hear about. So when you're an end customer or you're an AWS or you're another partner, what good looks like definitely is digitate and these are the partners that we really lean in with and support from a go to market standpoint, from a solution building standpoint, we figure out how we can scale. Together, so it's a, it's a great success story and, and Digitate Igneo leveraging the marketplace. BMC leveraging leveraging AWS Marketplace. This is really the next generation of sales platform. So if anyone got to hear Matt Wise, uh, Matt Yinen's keynote on Marketplace and, and all of the, the new announcements that we're making, you know, from a next generation sales and a next generation experience. and engagement. You take an IO, you take a digitate and an AWS, and it's an extremely powerful combination of delivering value on time and most importantly delivering outcomes. So we look at the type of partner that we want to look for, we want to invest in, and Digitate certainly represents that. And so we, we're always exploring how we unlock value, how we accelerate time to value, and we accelerate time. To market and as a as a complete package of partnership and relationship, super excited to be supportive of Digitate and all that they're doing in the market. So just as a quick say hi and a huge endorsement of all the things that we're doing with Digitate. So very excited and I think we're going to open up to some Q&A, right? Sure, if you have a question we can answer. There's some questions. Happy to to field all of those. Was it that thorough? Uh, um, Rajiv, good stuff. Ne able to, to deliver that with no questions. OK. OK well I thank you very much I think that's a wrap thank you thank you. All right, good job. Thank you.
