>> Thanks, Matt. Good morning.
Hello, everyone. I'm thrilled to join you at this
transformative time. We're clearly witnessing a golden
area of creativity where AI is amplifying human ingenuity and
enabling people to bring their imagination to life. Adobe has
been at the forefront of this revolution, from the invention
of desktop publishing to the origins of digital documents to
groundbreaking advances in imaging and video, we're
constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible.
It was actually our transformation to a Cloud based
subscription model over a decade ago that marked the
beginning of our relationship with AWS, because it was
services like Amazon EC2 and S3 that actually provided us with
the scalable as well as secure foundation for Adobe's
innovation. As we transition into this era of AI. AWS is
actually helping us innovate faster with the core services
that we need, as Matt said, to train models as well as deploy
agents. And this allows us to focus on what Adobe does best
unleashing creativity across every facet of digital
experiences. For our business, which spans business
professionals, consumers, creators, creative
professionals, as well as marketing and IT professionals.
When it comes to AI for creativity, we're reimagining
every stage of the process for people, of every skill level.
We do this with the knowledge that over 90% of creators
actively are using creative, focused, Generative AI today.
And to support them, we're infusing AI into Adobe. Firefly
are all in one destination for creative workflows driven by AI.
In our flagship Creative Cloud applications like Photoshop and
Adobe Express. The quick and easy app to create on brand
content. It's just an example our Adobe Firefly model that
powers capabilities like stack to image, text to video,
generative Fill, and generative recolor have actually been
trained and are using both P5 and P6 instances with all the
data stored in S3 and FSx for Lustre, these models have
actually been used to generate over 29 billion assets and
enable creators to create content with unmatched creative
control. In our AI assistant. Now in Adobe Express helps
users redefine their entire creative process using
conversational editing, and these experiences are now
powered by our AI platform, and our relationship with AWS helps
ensure that these agents operate efficiently and, more
importantly, securely. When it comes to productivity, PDF
remains the way that people consume information. Over 40
billion PDFs have been opened and shared with Adobe Acrobat,
and every year, more than 18 billion PDF files are created
and edited by our customers around the world. Today, we're
integrating productivity for billions of business
professionals and consumers through AI capabilities,
including an AI assistant. In August, we announced Adobe
Acrobat Studio, a first of its kind platform that brings
together Acrobat, Adobe Express, and AI agents to enable users
like you to work more efficiently with both
structured and unstructured information. Our collaboration
with AWS is absolutely key here, given Acrobat Studio uses
Amazon SageMaker as well as Amazon Bedrock to access our
and third party models, helping millions of users research,
strategize, analyze, and collaborate even faster. Adobe
PDF is also a new offering that helps consumers and business
professionals now collaborate with conversational knowledge
hubs that are supported by the Personalized AI assistance. And
finally, in the AI era, we all know that the role of marketers
has evolved to the orchestration of engaging
customer experiences for their consumers and customers. To
support them, we're unifying the key elements of customer
engagement the content supply chain, as well as brand
visibility. Adobe Experience Platform is the core foundation
for driving this customer engagement, bringing together
AI powered apps and agents to drive engagement and loyalty.
It operates at the scale of over 35 trillion segment
evaluations and more than 70 billion profile activations per
day, and experience platform runs using AWS building blocks,
as well as an innovative cellular architecture. Our
joint customers can now ingest data from sources like Redshift
into the Adobe Experience platform to create these
profiles, hydrate them, and use these audiences in Adobe's real
time customer data platform. Key. I think to this, customer
engagement is creating on brand content that's delivered in the
right time, in the right channel, at exactly the right
moment, because marketers expect that the demand for
content will grow five x over the next two years, and every
business needs a content supply chain to manage this. Adobe
Jens studio is our solution to address this in an end to end
fashion, and Amazon AWS is a key collaboration even here, by
integrating our creative and customer experiences with how
creative and marketers can now bring all of these ideas to
market. And finally, brand visibility is clearly top of
mind for CMOs as we all turn to these LMS for information,
recommendations as well as purchase decisions. We actually
observed a 100% year over year increase in AI traffic to US
retail sites as recently as September, and with products
like Adobe Experience Manager, as well as the newly available
Adobe LLM Optimizer and Adobe Brand Concierge, we're helping
brands stay in front of the AI search. We're really excited
about the promise of AgentCore and Kiro to help us accelerate
the deployment of all these new Agentic capabilities. We've
already had numerous successful AgentCore proof of concepts.
For example, our Adobe Commerce team was able to run a
prototype migration assessment using AgentCore to help our
customers identify as well as solve compatibility challenges
as they move to this SaaS product. Adobe has incorporated
AI into our tools for over 15 years, delivering hundreds of
advances that enhance this efficiency and collaboration.
99% of fortune 100 companies have used Adobe AI in an
application across all these categories. AWS is helping us
to innovate faster, operate more efficiently, and deploy
new technologies at scale. Whether it's in the data layer
where we train our category leading Adobe Firefly
Foundation Models, whether, as Matt said, in making sure that
we offer choice in AI models so we can continue to innovate in
creative categories through agent orchestration, where
we're augmenting this ecosystem and finally integrating AI into
all of our apps, making it easy for customers of all types to
adopt and realize value where they do their work. Today. It's
an incredibly exciting time to stand at this intersection of
human and computer interaction and the AI transformation.
Adobe and AWS are driving together, I believe will
redefine digital experiences for billions of people around
the world, and we couldn't be more excited to work with all
of you. Thank you.
