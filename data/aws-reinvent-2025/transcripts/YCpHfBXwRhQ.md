Uh, welcome to our session today. Uh, anthology boosts contact center efficiency with, uh, AI. If you are here you are likely interested in delivering great customer experiences or great customer service just to get the blood flowing a little bit, uh, quick raise of hands, how many of you are leaders of a customer experience or a customer service organization? I expected that most of you, um, how many of you make technology decisions for a customer service organization? Seems like pretty much the same group again. Um, how many of you manage, uh, teams of human agents? OK, slightly smaller population there. Thank you. Helps me get to know you guys a little bit better. The. Alright, well, I'm Sandeep Rao. I'm a senior go to market specialist with Amazon Connect, our contact center as a service offering. I've spent the last 6 years bringing voice conversational AI solutions to market. 2 years with Amazon Alexa and 4 years with Amazon Connect. Joining me for a discussion today are Richa Batra, a senior vice president at Anthology, and Kathy Hofstetler, an AWS senior solutions architect. They'll be joining me on stage for a panel in about 10 minutes. But before we do that, we're going to talk a little bit about Amazon Connect, give you a little bit of an introduction for those of you who are unfamiliar. So at Amazon, being customer obsessions is in our DNA, and our mission is to be Earth's most customer centric company. This same spirit is why we developed Amazon Connect to bring the power of the cloud to contact centers, and this started a few years ago. The Amazon.com customer service team was facing new challenges. And they needed a way to solve those challenges, and our decision was, should we buy this technology. Nope, we're just gonna build it ourselves. Now, what makes great customer experience? In our experience talking to dozens of executives, hundreds of executives, there are 3 things that we look to deliver. Responsiveness and adaptivity. This means obviously giving immediate help when customers need it, but evolving to meet their needs as they change. Proactivity and continuity. A customer service interaction does not incur in isolation. Customers want to remember all of their interactions. And they want you to know their needs before they do. And finally, understanding and personalization. Customers want a relationship with their organization. They don't want generic answers and generic recommendations. They want answers and recommendations that are tailored to their specific situation. These same executives have told us the challenges of delivering a great customer experience. The first complexity. This creates organizational paralysis. The second is inflexibility. This keeps businesses stuck. If the market changes, they can't adapt. And the third is status quo, and this is the one that we deal with the most, right? Maybe what you're doing today is good enough, but good enough leads to organizations falling behind. I But that doesn't have to be the way we're helping customers move forward into a new world and achieve the business outcomes that they want. Our top goal is to drive efficiency, and this is through technology consolidation, as well as bringing AI to every single interaction. Now with efficiency, customers are also looking to keep costs the same or lower, and we do this, and I think this is one of our major innovations is we have a usage-based pricing model so that if your interaction volumes go up, you pay more. If your interaction volumes go down, you pay less. And finally they want to reinvest those cost savings into new innovations and new technology. And that's another great feature of Amazon Connect. We're constantly innovating. We're constantly bringing new features to market, and I'm going to talk about a few of those features today before we start the panel. Guys maybe you have seen this slide before. I'll run through this one quickly. Uh, this is just a few dozen organizations that use Amazon Connect. Some of my customers here like Delta and Dish Network, and they're just examples of the tens of thousands of organizations that use Amazon Connect today. And we power more than 15 million contact center interactions. All these customers depend on us. To support their most important customer interactions, and they're looking to us to transform their customer experience. Now this is an important slide. I think this slide really shows the pace of innovation of Amazon Connect. In 2017 when we started, we were just a disruptor in this space. If you guys know the Gartner Magic Quadrant, disruptor. After that we moved into the visionary category. In the last 3 years we have been a leader in the contact center as a service space, and we started just with voice capabilities. In the last 8 years we've added more channels, we have added human aging capabilities, we've added analytics, and we've also added artificial intelligence, and now artificial intelligence powers every single part of our solution. And it's, you know, positioned us well for the next wave of evolution in the contact center space. OK, I'm going to talk to you guys about a few of our launches here. Hopefully you've heard of them, but if not, we'll talk more here. At Amazon Connect, we want to help orchestrate all types of interactions blending agentic AI. Deterministic AI and human agent capabilities. And there's a few important characteristics to note. First is you don't need to be all human capabilities, you don't need to be all agentic AI. We allow you to choose how much of each you wanna bring to the table. The second thing is that the same infrastructure is used across these types of experiences, the same tech to build, the same tech to deploy, the same tech to measure. And finally we give you choice. So if you want to use our artificial intelligence solutions, you can choose the models that you want. So these are some of our launches that we had here at Reinvent this year. Uh, I'm gonna talk about two categories of launches. The first is action with AI. AI is acting autonomously with predefined limits, and there's a sort of a set of launches that we'll discuss here. The second bullet here, uh, we launched first party agents. These are pre-built AI agents, uh, for core contact center use cases. We also launched next to that support for third party AI agents. This means integrations with third party AI agents. Finally, we brought to the table uh more humanlike natural sounding voices. This is a really important innovation, and these voices understand and enable more fluid conversations. The 2nd category of launches we had this week, or the 2nd 1 we'll talk about today, um, are the accelerating outcome launches, and this is around observability and analytics. Observe observability and analytics are super important, right? It's, it's easy to run a pilot, but how do you go from pilot to production, and that's where these launches come in. The first launch is simply just to see how your AI agents are being used and how they're performing. The 2nd launch our performance evaluations. We've already had that available for human agents. We're now making that experience available for self-service and for AI agents. And the 3rd flow, the 3rd 1 is workflow and CX testing and simulation. Now you can see how all your agents are performing before they go live. Again, all helping customers go from pilot to production. All right, well thank you for sticking with me through that part of the uh presentation. I'd now like to bring to the stage, uh Richa and Cathy so we can begin the panel portion of the comments. Please join me. Yeah. A clicker, thank you. Thank you. All right, let me take out my questions here. So Richa, welcome. Thank you, Cathy, welcome. Thank you. So Ria, can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your role with Anthology? Absolutely. I, um, Anthology is an education technology company. We do everything in higher ed, uh, from learning management system to back office operations to student success, and I run the student success division. We have over 1000 employees and we work on student support and I've been at the organization for 15 years. I've run our contact centers and now I run our business. Awesome, thank you, Risa. Cathy, can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your role with Anthology? Certainly, um, my name is Kathy Hef Stettler, and I'm a senior solutions architect at AWS. I've been partnering with Anthology for the past 3 years now, serving as their technical advisor, specifically on their student success transformation to Amazon Connect. My role has been to help the team architect and implement cloud-based solutions to enhance their student engagement capabilities. Great thank you Cathy and by the way we're gonna be having a discussion here but you'll also see some slides uh that support parts of our conversation. OK, so Ria, let's just start off with what is anthology's mission? So the Student Success division, we support students outside the classroom. Um, we primarily support higher education. We're in essence a BPO, uh, for education, and we support student experiences, um, 8 million inbound and outbound per year, and our mission is to be able to increase enrollment and student retention on behalf of institutions. And so, you know, over, over the years, the, um, being a student has become much more complicated. It's much more difficult to navigate through college systems whether it's financial aid or admissions, and I can empathize. I'm a first generation college student, so understanding how to be a student and how to navigate those processes and, and stay on track is really difficult, and we're finding more students are having challenges with that, and that's where our support and our mission really is how do we support these students throughout these journeys using a combination of our technology and our people to do that. Thank you, that was a powerful anecdote. So, um, maybe you can tell the audience a little bit about how anthology engages with students today. Um, when I started, we were a contact center, traditional contact center. We did 24/7 support for, for Blackboard, the learning management system, and that's how we started. And over the years the institutions that we supported wanted to leverage our capabilities to do more because they didn't have the scale. So then we started doing financial aid, admissions, um, everything an institution needs outside the classroom, and so we have evolved over the years. And our model has really been in place where we hire uh human agents to take inbound and outbound calls to support students and we went live with Connect in July at the beginning of our back to school period and so our new model is every interaction starts with um voice and chat uh powered through Connect and then uh we have humans behind that to be able to support students um for more complex questions that need to be resolved. Great. Now you're obviously up up here because you've undergone a transformation in your contact center. Can you maybe tell the audience like what were the drivers of that transformation? And how does that fit with your vision? Absolutely, and many of you, I'm sure are thinking about this or have gone through it yourself. It has taken us over 5 years. This, this whole concept started well before AI did. And so about 5 years ago, our objective was how do we take our homegrown CRM that we built on our own and our on-premise contacts at our infrastructure. Our IVR and how do we move it to the cloud that was the vision that was the, the objective and then it evolved into how do we make sure we have more reliable technology, um, you know, we have a medium sized contact center but very large for education. How do we make sure we have the up time, uh, we have the, the reliability for not only our employees but for our users and our and our clients and then it turned into. To well how can we leverage this to automate and scale we handle so many interactions we know exactly who's going to call in at what time, what time of the year, and what those questions are. So can we start leveraging technology to do that? And it really was when AI became real enough for our vision to change to be able to say we can actually leverage technology to transform our business model. It went from being very iterative to transformative, and that's, um, I think when things started to shift for us. Right? I mean, 5 years, that's a long journey. I know. I think people say I'm very persistent. I don't know. There may be some other words that can be used as well. Terrific. So, um, how are you looking to evolve the student engagement model and why was now the right time to do it? Um, you know, I think one of the additional goals is since we have such a seasonality to our business in, in education, there's a huge spike over the summer, July, August, and September when students are going back to school and then also in January, and, and many of you, if you work in other, uh, industries where there's a high seasonality, we basically for a large part of the year stopped everything that we're doing and we focused on almost getting through the back. To school summer and it was very disruptive to innovation. It was more so let's get through this, um, and so that was one of the objectives was how do we reduce our reliance on doubling in size. So if we have a staff of 1000 today, we hire over 1000 every summer to be able to support student inquiries. So that was one of, one of them and it wasn't just a cost cutting thought or cost cutting measure. It was more so. How do we think about the student and what that experience would be like if we reduce the um need to hire so many new people and then from there you know as as I've mentioned we we know exactly what those top questions are we can really say it's it's 20 they're more they're more than that but they're 20 repeatable questions. How can we leverage technology to be able to answer those in alternative ways for users. And make sure that they're handled consistently um for those repeatable questions and then we can leverage our teams that know financial aid really well or admissions really well and coach that student through that process um and I I you may experience this as well we still have our top question as how do I reset my password or how do I log in and um for someone who runs the contact centers in our in our organization. I'm always very sheepish to actually submit a ticket to have my password reset, but it happened on the way here. It happens to all of us. And so how do we make that experience frictionless for the user because students today have so many things going on just like all of your users do, but that password reset may be the difference of saying, you know what, I, I give up. I'm gonna take a break from this class and it may be more difficult for them to return later. Great, um, so you mentioned a few business outcomes I believe in that last question, but maybe you can help us understand what are the key KPIs that you were looking for in this kind of change. I mean this is a very measured business. I mean many of you, we measure, um, everything in 15 minute increments. So when we started this initiative we wanted to make sure we were clear on our objectives. One was having compliant technology. We're working with student data, so we want. To make sure that um from from our own organization as well as the institutions that we support that we had compliant technology to do that the seasonal hiring was another one we thought a success measurement would be after the launch if we can reduce our reliance on seasonal hiring, not eliminate it, but just reduce it, that would start changing the dynamic of the business and how we can think differently. Um, and another one that many contact center leaders, uh, work through in a key KPI is what was the wait time chat, voice, uh, average speed to answer is something we all talk about, um, so that was another objective, and then productivity handle time, um, the these are measurements that we all look at on an hourly daily basis, um, and if these were some of the things that we could see succeed after the implementation, that's what we were really focused on. Got it. So you mentioned 5 years from beginning of initiative to now. Can you tell us how this initiative was received by your organization? Um, it, it wasn't approved until last, until last August. So over, over the years we've had so many stakeholders, but I presented this business case to 3 different CEOs, 3 CFOs, 3 different boards. So obviously there's a lot of change within our organization, but stake, you know, those are key stakeholders. As well as my own organization and my team, uh, running a traditional contact center team, you have a lot of people involved in this process as well as the institutions that we support, so a lot of key stakeholders, um, it, it did not get approved because, and, and now I have some time to reflect on, on why, um, but it was always presented as a lift and shift and so every time we went through it, the, the, while the slides may have changed or our recommendations changed, it always started with we're. We're Gonna move from our homegrown CRM and our traditional contact center um infrastructure and we're gonna move to the cloud or we're gonna leverage automation and it it really wasn't until um we started thinking about it a little bit differently and had those change management conversations with our team of this is resetting the vision and transforming the business. This is not a lift and shift that I think we were able to get a little bit more um. I think collaboration uh internally and externally and from the leadership teams to be able to do that but certainly was a change curve and and for all of us to work through it. I think when people hear AI uh they automatically think, especially I think in the contact center space as well, my job may be eliminated my job may look different, and it really is thinking about it of what can we do that we can't do today to leverage technology. Great, and I think there's an important point in there. Um, maybe people treat a change in technology as an opportunity to just lift and shift, but this really is an opportunity to look at ways to transform or modernize your contact center if you're gonna make that big of a change anyway. All right, so you wanted a cloud-based AI first strategy. Let's talk about what alternatives you consider to achieve that. Absolutely, you know, we went through this many, many different iterations of it, and we looked at traditional models of, and we went through the requirements. I actually can think back at what that spreadsheet looked like of what are, what are the features and the functions of what our technology does today, what are our requirements, and as we were looking at CRM as well as IVRs, what, what do the other providers have, and it was very similar to what. We did, um, traditional contact center models as well as, um, traditional pricing, so those things were continuing to be the factors, but we also looked at do we build this in-house and so years ago when the conversation about chatbots started, so about 6, uh, 6-7 years ago we decided we built our own, um, and we really didn't have the development velocity to be able to do anything beyond building a very static chatbot that was. Gonna return um a series of answers but more more than likely gonna pass you on to a live agent and so since we knew that was our experience that our philosophy was we're just gonna keep the lights on with technology, we really needed to think about it differently and so the other models of looking at CCA kept us in that in that same model of um how we were pricing things or or how things cost for us and how we were delivering a traditional contact center experience. OK, great. Now I know uh you started to look at AWS you started to look at Amazon Connect uh how did you begin that journey? You know, um, the last time this was not approved, so I'm gonna go back a year and a half. Our current CEO came to me and said, Why don't you look at AWS? He had worked with AWS for years at previous companies, and he said, Why don't you have a conversation with them? So we, so we did, and I think once we started looking at Connect, I think it made it really clear that this was not gonna be a lift and shift. Like if we looked at our spreadsheet of the features and functionalities, it wasn't that conversation, um, and. I think you know when we first started having the discussions with AWS, it helped us actually change our thinking, uh, as opposed to we need these X features. It was more so what is the student experience and thinking about the user and the student at the center of that journey and that really shifted us in our thinking, um, and, and AI was just not available when we started this conversation. Like if our goal was how do we move to the cloud, AI wasn't an option, so we didn't have that ability to think. In that way, um, so I think the first conversation with AWS, our AI fluency grew. I think the technology absolutely has, has immensely the, the speed of iteration, um, and so I think AWS came to us to be able to really handle a complex solution in a really simple way and helped us navigate through that. Terrific. It's really interesting to hear about your journey evolving over the course of this period that you were deciding your options. Now Cathy, thank you for for waiting patiently, but this is where you come in, um. So tell us, as a senior solutions architect, uh, what were your goals when you first engaged with RCA and Anthology? So my initial focus was in understanding anthology's vision for transforming student engagement, and their commitment to enhancing student experiences through technology aligned perfectly with AWS's working backwards approach. So I collaborated with Amazon Connect specialists to help demonstrate how cloud-based contact center capabilities such as um AI and automation could help support their student engagement um vision in addition to meeting their long term goals. That makes sense, and I know there's always this. Desire to begin solution building when you start out on a new project with a customer, but what steps did you take to help refine the scope of this initiative and make sure it was the right fit? So while it's tempting to always jump straight into technical solution, we approached this methodically, uh, we, we did discovery, um, workshops to understand their current architecture at their contact center uh, we wanted to understand their current operational metrics and their desired future state. Um, we also worked with, um. Their team analyzing the student um call center data uh patterns as well as the um insights and we did this in a methodical implementation strategy approach and this helped us balance quick wins with their long term transformation goals. Terrific. So Richa, back to you, um, can you walk us through the, the choice you made? Why did you find Amazon Connect to be a a differentiating option? You know, to add on to what Cathy said, I, I think first and foremost when we met with AWS, it allowed us to change our thinking from a lift and shift. I also, you know, when the team came, it was not about here is the solution. It was really thinking about what our, what our mission was, what our goals were, our values very much aligned there as well, um, and I think one in particular. We consider ourselves student obsessed. We're always talking about students. Um, we think about ourselves as students previously. We go on campus to see what students are like today, and it was very clear, uh, the AWS team was customer obsessed. So I think the values very much aligned there and also our urgency moving from a completely new contact center infrastructure and to go live before. Our biggest peak period. I, I know it was an aggressive time frame, but I, I think the team knew exactly what we needed to do and pulled in all the resources and helped us navigate through that. And so I think they matched the urgency along with us, and they were with us. Like I knew how much was on the line for us to go live for July 1, and they were there every, every step of the way. And I think, you know, I'll, I'll call out Cathy. In the in the whole team, but very much I, I don't feel like I'm alone. Like there's not a problem Cathy's not gonna pull the resources in for and it's um not just about saying here, you know, I checked the box, here's a solution, but really thinking through it, um, and I'll, and I'll give you an example since we went live a few months ago, one of the, one of the goals were what does our containment rate look like? Like how do we think about the student experience. What is going to be handled through AI and when we were looking at that, I think Kathy helped us navigate that to say, well, let's look at your data before, let's look at it now, and let's look at what the student experience and the journey is like so it's much more collaborative and I think about it as an iterative process to help achieve our goals. That makes sense. Um, I love that. You said you are student obsessed and that mission aligns with Amazon trying to be customer obsessed. It's really nice to hear uh the matching of visions there. So Amazon Connect has a lot of capabilities, right, Cathy? How did you, how did you build a, a custom launch plan? How did you decide what to do first? So our launch plan, we focused on three key principles. We wanted to minimize risk. We want to maximize impact, and we want to ensure adoption. So, um. We started with the core capabilities implementing for Amazon Connect then we progressively introduced AI, um, such as contact lens, and, um, we started, you know, with that we were able to do student self-serve agent assist as well as um interaction insights so, um, we maintain close alignment with Rich's team. And we used success metrics to make sure we delivered value and we're meeting their KPIs. Great. And what resources did you bring to bear? Did you facilitate to help Anthology with this? So we formed a one team approach. We started with Amazon Connect specialists like I mentioned before, and they did some technical deep dives. We also brought in AWS professional services and a partner to deliver an agile delivery framework, and we actually brought in the Amazon Connect Service team, all working as one team to help transform. Their student success vision so this collaborative approach I believe did help anthology with their their vision for student engagement, turning it from a vision into reality. That's great and it's important to note there are many layers of support with Amazon Connect, right? You have the account teams like Cathy who are there to help, but there's also the service team, the go to market teams. We have, uh, free resources to help you get started. We have paid resources to help you, uh, finally be deployed to production, so there's a lot that we can bring to bear to help organizations as they're making this journey themselves. OK, we've buried the lead long enough. Um, can you tell us how it's going so far? Are there any measurables that you can share with the audience? Yes, uh, we are very measured in the before, before and after, but we're, we're incredibly pleased. Um, it was, I mean, this is something that I've been trying to push for, for over 5 years, so I had a lot of conviction this is something we should do. Um, I'm very. Attached to it, I wanted to make sure we were delivering for our the institutions and students that we support. So with this much change within an organization, it went incredibly well. Like July 1 peak period, we took calls. There was no break from doing what we needed to do, and the fact that there was no downtime, we flipped a switch and it was, and we were ready, uh, went incredibly well. So I'll, I'll share a couple of metrics. There were some that we talked about were the objectives of moving forward with new technology, and some were unplanned and like bonus highlights of what we've seen so far. But wait times, and we, we certainly, I spend, I spend time over the summer and back to school hearing feedback from our clients and our users saying I waited, you know, 1. Period of time and I really needed this financial aid question because I can't register for classes without it. Um, we've reduced our wait times by 50% during our busiest month of the year and we've not had one escalation, uh, since we've gone live on what those wait times are. So I mean that is something that we spent so much time trying to address and that problem since July has been eliminated. Um, you know, one thing that wasn't necessarily a documented goal, but when we were, you know, working with the, the, um, Proserve team was we are looking for over 90% accuracy for, for go live from UAT and what we've actually seen with human agents. Now with um virtual agents we're seeing 14 point increase on accuracy um so this is something that's only gonna evolve and get better and I think about all the conversations we had prior to that is if if an um an agent answered something incorrectly before you would go through the steps of I'm gonna coach the agent I'm gonna, you know, do. Retraining, but it's not always consistently done, especially when you're on boarding the amount of people that we do, and the fact that we've already seen 14 points, you know, we're only gonna optimize this even, even further. So, um, those are two, and then another one, any of you that are hiring agents, um, attrition. The amount of time we spend on training new hires, working, you know, understanding the education system, understanding what tools to use, I mean the fact that we were able to reduce attrition by 10% just by going live, I mean those are things that we're already looking at for our January back to school to say. Let's look at the training again. Let's look at the onboarding. Can this number be reduced to a point where we're keeping our steady state employees and we don't have these high seasonal peaks, um, and that would improve the experience and the consistency that our users are getting as well. And then, you know, as, as I mentioned earlier on. Compliance, reliability, those were some of the original reasons we wanted to move to new technology and you know, every summer I'm like looking at these, you know, thinking about these numbers, but every back to school we would have 12 unplanned outages in our busiest months of July, August, and September because of the, because of the load and this back to school. We had 2, and, and these again were on many other applications. These were not AWS related, but like in that period of time from 12 to 2, we can absolutely feel the decrease in disruption because when when systems are down, everything stopped and we had failover plans that were very manual to be able to handle, handle that um. And you know these are such difficult things to be able to manage in a transformation. The fact that we're able to see these quick wins has allowed us to think forward to say, OK, how do we optimize beyond this? We're getting to the, we're getting beyond the baseline of what we even expected. How can we even think bigger? That's really great thank you and I love this slide. I love this data and I can tell having you know prepared this presentation with you, um you know how impactful it's been during your peak seasons. I think we have one more question here um this question is really just, uh, you know, what advice would you give to members of this audience who are also evolving their engagement models um, what should they think about. Um, yes, and you know I had so many years of going through this business case and, and trying to present it, but I think, you know, as we were going through the implementation, one thing that I did center myself back on is because I'm, I'm more on the business side and I wanted to be able to say what are, why are we doing this? What are the business goals? Who do we serve, and I always focused on that because it was really easy, I think for me and my teams to get distracted about the technology. And the names of the ML models and everything that was coming out feature function wise, we just really need to always come back to what are the things that we're accountable for, what are our business objectives, and what do we expect and I think that's one thing that I would, um, you know, encourage everyone to always, always focus on and then from there understand what can the technology do to achieve those goals. I think one of the examples that I used during, you know, you. was we wanted to get over 90% accuracy. Um, the Proserve team actually came back and said, well, we actually have another ML model that we're testing. We recommend that because based off of your business objective this is gonna work better to get you the result. That's what got us to the 14 point increase in the accuracy. Um, so I think it's always really good, you know, imperative for me to be focused on the business goals and tie everything back to that. Um, also, the, the change management, we, we manage large teams of people. Everyone is gonna go through the change curve at different pace. Um, some people are gonna be resistant, and I think just making sure that building that process in early on, and I did weekly calls with our clients as well as our teams to be able to say. This is what we, these are our goals and objectives. This is how we're performing to them and allowing the time and space for the questions because, you know, I'm, you know, I have had so much more time to think about this and digest this information. My teams haven't or our clients haven't, and I wanted them to be able to hear it directly from me as well, um. You know, I think a couple, a couple of other key ones is originally when we signed, uh, signed up with the team we were going to go live with everything all at once on the same day and I thought this was such a good plan, but, um, as we, as we went through it, you know, the thought was, OK, we should actually do this in a series of releases, and that's where we, we ended up to say we're gonna do release one on July 1st, we're gonna do release two on July 22nd. We actually have our 4th release in December and that is that's not the framework of how we're gonna operate and iterate because we've learned from every one of these and also features are getting released in between each of our releases and so that has worked really nicely and I think that's like the culture that we've developed within within our own organization, um, you know, I think that the last lesson learned that I'll leave everyone here with is if you're working in. Contact centers. I've been at this one for over 1515 years, and it, you know, there's traditional contact centers can be reactive. You're dealing with people, uh, schedules of people that want to work, um, agent attrition, handle time, and, you know, now that we have the foundation of connect, I can, I can tell you myself and my entire team, we, we now have the mind space to be strategic, and I think we're now at a point leveraging. AI and connect that it's gonna allow us to be proactive and strategic in a way we did not have the ability to do and I'm very excited about that of moving away from the reactive to the proactive. Well thank you and I appreciate those lessons and hopefully you guys took a lot away from that advice. Um, oh, it looks like we have a bonus question here. Uh, I forgot about this one. OK, so Ria, what's next for your organization? You you know what I'd like to move forward to in the next year is now we know we have the foundation to be able to handle student inquiries. I would love to get to a place in the next year that we're proactively leveraging the data that we have and reaching out to the student before there's a need for it, um, and we can use the example of password. Reset or financial aid application, we know what these points of time are. We know when the semester starts, how do we leverage the data and know and and use what we know about these students and actually proactively reach out to them and say your financial aid application is due in 60 days. Here are the three things that you need to do. Well, great, um, this ends the 2nd part of our presentation, which is the panel. We're gonna move on to the 3rd part of our presentation. Cathy here is gonna walk through a demonstration of this technology. Uh, live, yes, so, well, not live recorded, recorded demos, but live for you guys, yes, thank you, Sandy. So before we get started, uh, I'm gonna show you a few clips of demos here, but I wanna give you some background context how Amazon Connect is used by different personas. So in the first demo that you're gonna see next here is going to be from the persona of the student using Amazon Connect and in this case. Case we're gonna have a student Millard who is confused about financial aid and Miller's calling about the status of her refund, OK, um, we're gonna have another demo following that and this is gonna be from the persona of the agent and in this case the agent, he's Herbert, he's new to call center customer service. It happens to be his first day answering calls and chats, and he doesn't have a lot of comprehensive knowledge about financial aid. So in the last we're also gonna see Amazon Connect through the persona of the supervisor and in this case it's gonna be Adam. Now Adam is a tenured supervisor and he oversees the daily interaction with the um calls with the student and the agent and he's also responsible for the quality assurance of training those agents. So let's dive in and see these demos. OK, this is gonna be the first demo clip. These are silent. I'm gonna walk you through them. So, before we get started with this demo, I just wanna let you know that this is going to be the interaction with the persona from the student's perspective. So here we go. OK, so you can see here. The AI assistant greets the student and provides an outline of the services and capabilities it provides. The student types in the chat, Where's my refund? Now before the, the, um, AI assistant will provide this information, it does some verification and validation of the student by asking the student their ID as well as the last four digits of their Social Security number. Now, once the student provides this information, and there they are, they're providing it now. The system is gonna provide the detailed response, which is a refund was provided of $800 in the fall of 2025. Now, the student here has not received this refund, so the student's gonna ask to speak with a live agent. What's notable here is the natural language flow between the AI assistant and the student. So let's take a look at the next demo. Now this demo is from um Amazon Connect in action from the agent's perspective. So if you remember this is Herbert, it's his first day doesn't have a lot of background, no experience with call center customer service first day handling this, and he has lack of knowledge with um financial aid, you know, Cathy, what I'll add to this is when. We were training to go live. I set myself up as an agent to take interactions because it was so important to me that if I'm telling everyone we're moving to new tech that it needed to be, I mean, my point was it's gonna be so easy. I can handle the call and I recorded it and that's what we sent out for the onboarding, um, video for all of our agents. OK, so I'm gonna play this demo here and. What you're gonna see here is a seamless continuation of the interaction going from the AI assistant to the live agent Herbert and so Herbert greets the students and the AI interaction is summarized so Herbert doesn't have to ask the same questions over again. He has that background context. He knows why they're calling and what they need. He leverages step by step guides on the the refund to find out what the status is. He follows the steps and he looks and he sees that the refund was processed. And it was by paper check and it was over 20 days ago. So he receives AI assistance guidance in what to do and how to provide this information to the student, which essentially the student needs to call Bank mobile, a phone number and to ask for their check to be reissued because it was a paper check and it was over 21 days ago, so it must have got lost in the mail or something like that. OK. And you can just see here the demo is still running a little bit more, where he's looking at, that's the AI assist there on the right, cue and connect. It's providing this information to the agent based on their conversation. So he doesn't have to go research all this and pull information. It's really, really nice here, very efficient, and then he can go give that information to the student here you go, please call Bank mobile. Here's the phone number. Maybe one thing I'll add here is that the Connect AI agent that was used in the beginning. That same infrastructure of building an AI agent is leveraged to assist the human agent in this scenario, right? So we're talking about the same tech being used to develop AI agents for self-service as it is AI agents for human agent assistance on the right hand panel. I don't know what happened. Alright, there we go squeeze back. Alright, so now that that's been handled, we're going to look at this demo and this is gonna be from the persona of the supervisor Adam, um, so what you're seeing here, I'll go ahead and play this one is. On the left hand side of the screen you're gonna see the metadata where it has the information of um what time the call was, the duration, who the agent was, along with um on the right right hand side of it you're gonna see Amazon Connects AI summarization capability. Now what's really nice here is previously supervisors would have to listen to this, um, the call recordings or review the chats and they would do this manually and it would be very, very time consuming. But now with Amazon Connect and AI, the summarization is provided for the supervisors, so it's a little bit more efficient. You can see here it summarized the reason for the call and how it was resolved by the agent. And so I mean Cathy, what I, what I will add, and, and I think you've probably heard this in other sessions or have experienced it yourself, um, our aspiration was to be able to review 1% of all the interactions before, um, I mean now with the, the efficiency of being able to do this, uh, we're able to actually proactively and reactively troubleshoot any client specific items or trends that we're seeing. So you've gone from 1% to how many percent? we can do 100% now and you can set up rules and contact lens to be able to say I want to be able to address the verification process and it's now able to send us a report and, and we can address that. I mean, almost in real time. Couple more demos for you. So continuing on here, this, uh, is also going to be from the supervisor's perspective. But this demo is going to show you actually the sentiment analysis so from that conversation in addition to the um summarization, you're going to see the sentiment analysis here where it has between the agent and the customer and what first turned out as concern and distress from the customer about their refund then turned around when they were provided a solution by the agent. It has the analysis there in addition to the transcript, so the supervisor has all this insight if they'd like to go back and particularly review this for training purposes, quality management, it's there. OK. I think it's done running OK Here we're gonna see automated evaluation of the agents. So as Richard was mentioning in your traditional contact centers, you know, maybe 1% of the um agents will be evaluated with Amazon Connect with AI you can do 100% automated agent evaluations using what you have here with a sentiment analysis and these questions that you can help with prompts, um. And that's what it's showing right here is the agent evaluation. It's very automated and Richard, did you want to add anything here? I think the scale that it's allowed us to bring, I mean one of the real examples that that came up this summer, uh, you may have even seen in the news, a lot of institutions were being targeted. Um, by threats we, we also because we're supporting institutions had those interactions through, through chat and voice, and we were able to use contact lens to be able to understand how that was happening, the pattern, and we were able to get it to local authorities within. I mean hours that would have taken us manual work of weeks to do that and that's the other thing here it adds the um saving you something that was done manually before going from 1% to 100% going from hundreds of hours to minutes to be able to have the manager review what the AI findings here. All right, so I've got one more demo. Now this one looks kind of similar, but this is a hybrid evaluation so this is a combination of AI and the human working together so in this case if the supervisor would like to add their own observations or modify the scorecard, they have the ability to do so and this provides the best of both worlds, allowing both AI and the human um expertise to work together for this hybrid evaluation. Again, it's leveraging the AI findings they can review it, they can modify it, they can tweak the scorecard if they wanna do so. So what I've shown here is a series of demos where AI can support the student through self-service with an AI assistant. It can support the agent with um knowledge-based articles and agent assist, as well as support the supervisor with insightful data, um, automated uh performance evaluations that are 100% automated or hybrid automated. These are just a few of the capabilities that I've demoed here. Terrific. Well, I think that is the end of our demonstrations, right, Cathy? Is there anything else? That is it. Uh, well, thank you first, Ria for joining us today and thank you, Cathy, for walking us through the demonstration. Uh, there are a couple of other really interesting customer experience sessions that you may want to attend tomorrow. The first one is Biz 216 redefining Service excellence, Canada Life's AI powered contact center. Another one tomorrow, Biz 218 UC San Diego Health modernizes patient engagement with Amazon Connect, uh, both happening here at the, the Wynn. Also do visit us in the expo hall, uh, the AWS village booth, uh, number 813. We'd love to, to talk to you and see you more. If you have any questions for us based on today's presentation, we'll stand in the back for another 10 minutes or so and answer your questions. Otherwise, thank you so much for spending your time today and uh have a great rest of your reinvent. Thank you, thank you.
