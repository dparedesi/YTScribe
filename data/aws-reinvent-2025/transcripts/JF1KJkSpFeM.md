Hello, everyone. Thanks a lot for coming in today. Um, I appreciate all of you being here. Uh, my name is Nit Jagannathan and I'm the product lead for AWS Transform. And joining me today is, uh, Sriniva Singarajun. Uh, please introduce yourself Sing much. Hello, everyone. Um, I'm, uh, Shrine Singhraja with Imia, uh, focusing on uh technology transformation at Imia. Yeah, joining me also is Rahul Chug, and he's an SA in AWS. Please introduce him. Yeah, uh, hi everyone. I'm Rahul Chug. Um, I'm AI acceleration essay, so I essentially help partners to accelerate migrations and modernization on AWS using AI and Gen AI technologies. Excellent. All right, thank you. So, um, today we're gonna be talking about how our customers Imia have used AWS Transform to break, uh, break down the technical debt that they have built over 25 years. While we're walking through this journey, we'll also like explain the new capabilities that we are introducing into AWS Transform for .NET as well, OK? Just before we get into this, uh, I wanna like kind of under, you know, like get a show of hands from all of you. How many of you know about AWS Transform for .NET? This is our agent DKA service we launched. OK. That's a, that's a few of you, and some of you are like fairly new. So I'll kind of set the context a little bit and then we can, um, you know, dive into some of the new capabilities that we have added. So the first thing that I want to talk about is You know, why do you, why does a customer want to modernize their .NET applications, right? Like from Windows to Linux, and a lot of customers who have applications that are written in .NET framework, that are like, you know, 20+ years old, and a lot of these legacy applications, uh, are only can run only on Windows, and that is preventing customers from, like, you know, taking advantage of the new technologies and, uh, flexibility that that is available to them by moving to Linux. Like if you move to Linux, you can run it on different instances whether it is X86 or like you know, even graviton instances you can run them as containers, take advantage of the scalability in that sense, or like, you know, you can run them as lambdas, right? And just running it on Windows is kind of prevents you from doing that. So that is one of the reasons why customers want to move out of, um, you know, like Windows ecosystem. And, but there are other advantages too. Some of the significant ones is definitely the operating cost reduction because the licensing costs that they have to pay for the Windows licenses is no longer applicable. So they're able to save up to 40% on some applications, right? And just by moving to the latest versions of Windows, that number like 1.5 to 2X, that's coming from Microsoft because of the complete, you know, like performance upgrades like across the entire stack, right, like the SDKs, the libraries, all of those are improving. So just by moving from .NET framework to .NET 8 or .NET 10, you are expecting to see like up to 2X performance improvement. And finally, I think the point that I talked about in terms of scalability, right? Once you can run it on Linux and as a container, you have a world of options. You have a lot more options of like, you know, how you want to scale, how you want to build new capabilities, all of those open up to you. So that's one of the reasons what we have seen is like up to 70% of our customers who are running Windows on AWS today, they're increasingly adopting Linux for their Windows ecosystem of applications. All right. So that sounds great, right? Like, but then, what is, what is preventing customers from uh actually like transforming their applications? But it is not exactly straightforward as that, right? Like, so for example, like in order to port your legacy applications, you wanna first analyze the code, identify incompatibilities that are there between the previous version and the current versions, and the longer the version, like for example, if framework 3.5 and you wanna move to .NET 8, a lot of those libraries are stale, you need to find different libraries, different mechanisms of doing some of those things, and then you have to port the code and finally validate and deploy. Even though it is showing this as like a single streamlined workflow, it is never that straightforward. Each one of these is a loop, and like, you know, developers, as you know, like, you know, you go make a change and then all of a sudden there is 200 builders, right? And then you have to go back and fix it. Then the libraries are wrong. So it just is a very cumbersome and like uh you know, undifferentiated heavy lifting for our customers because like they would rather wanna spend this time on focusing on the core you know, competencies of building new capabilities rather than trying and maintaining old code which they may not fully understand because the folks who wrote this code no longer there or they have moved on to something else, right? So it requires collaboration um across multiple organizations and it just is very slow progress. And this is exactly where AWS Transform for .NET comes in for folks who are not familiar with it, like this is the first agentic AA experience for transforming your .NET framework applications to .NET 8, and now we are supporting the .NET 10 at scale. So essentially like if you have hundreds of applications, thousands of applications, we are supporting those, uh, you know, in the agentic workflow model where. We are shifting the developer's role from that of an executor to a reviewer, right? Like, so it's a human in the loop, uh, reviewing of the code that is being transformed and how we're able to do that, we have a .NET domain, uh, expert agent that we have built on our own using like, you know, open source projects and all of our learnings that we have done over many years. And we are using that as a mechanism to for a unified web experience where customers can point to the repositories and we'll do all the transformation and cus you know, like developers can review it before they deploy it to their production environment. So just by doing that, right, um, customers can essentially like offload some of the tedious tasks that I was talking about and they can achieve acceleration of up to 4X. Then this is some of these numbers that we have seen by working with customers. We went, uh, we launched the service in preview in reinvent of last year. And we launched the service in um general availability in May 15 of 2025. So in the last six months, like, you know, customers have been like playing around with it and transforming at scale and, uh, you know, they've been porting hundreds of applications and they're boosting application performance, scalability and things like that as well. So what has changed, maybe I'll just touch upon what has changed from the GA to now. It's been 6 months, right? Like there are things that we have learned from talking to customers, understanding what capabilities that they want to go and build this product further. And so one of the first things that we have done is like expanding support to .NET 10, and Microsoft has released a new .NET version and like you know customers now they don't want just to go to 8, they wanna go to 10, so we are supporting that and more importantly like they wanna support .NET standard because like most of the customers with the legacy large legacy, uh, you know, like a real estate, I mean estate portfolio, they would wanna actually, uh, do it incrementally. So they don't want to break compatibilities with their .NET framework application sector. And if you don't want, if you don't want to move everything in one go to .NET 8 and you want to keep some of the applications in standard. That allows you to actually like, you know, uh, do it in an incremental fashion so the strangler pig pattern in instance, right? So that's why we had, we added support for .NET standard as well and more importantly, if you think of your .NET framework applications as a three layered cake, what we have done at GA was like transforming the middle layer, the business logic. But customers couldn't get, uh, you know, their UI ported. Like, you know, most of the framework applications were written on, uh, web forms, and they didn't have an exact straightforward way to transform them. So what we have done now is we have enabled the same agentic workflow for transforming your web forms to Blazer, and this allows customers to transform a lot of these legacy applications in one go, right? And also, like, you know, the entity framework and ADO ORM support, like, essentially what happens is that if your code was written for database access in framework with entity or ADO.NET, we are able to put those corresponding changes to the .NET8S. This is one of those things that if we didn't do this, customers have to go manually go make these changes, and with the agenttic experience, customers are able to, like, you know, take advantage of that. And that is only the feature capabilities, right? And then, but there is also the developers like we've been talking with a lot of developers and one of the things that they have provided feedback to us is that like they wanna see that once the transformation begins they wanna be able to like provide fine-grained inputs they wanna be able to customize it they wanna be able to nudge it in a specific direction. So to support that, what we have done is we have provided an editable transformation plan. So what are, what is the transformation plan? Rahul will show a demo of how this works, but essentially it's a high level flow of all the steps that the agent is gonna take to modernize your application portfolio, and customers will be able to say like, OK, make this choice, like go to this version instead of the other version. Those kind of changes, like, you know, that recommendation is gonna come there. And then also like, you know, they wanna understand how much time it's gonna take rather than being a black box be more transparent, give me more feedback on like exactly how long you're taking, which builder are you stuck on those kind of details we are now providing those to customers as well. And also, like, finally, like they wanna be able to use, um, you know, like a coding assistant of their choice. Let's say they're using Quiro they wanna be able to continue the work that AWS Transform has done, take it to Quiro, finish those changes, and then try again and like, you know, so fix issues and do it in an iterative format and we are enabling those kind of functionalities today. There will be a transformation plan with the next steps as a markdown which you can directly feed to Quiro, complete the job, and then run the transformation again. And finally, like one of the things that we had was it's available in two experiences, whether you start in web or whether you use Visual Studio IDE, you can, you can see the work that is happening across both of these together. So now there is no longer the separation of if I'm doing the work in IDE, I cannot see what's happening on the web experience and vice versa. So that it is now one unified workspace for your teams to collaborate together. So those are the functionalities that we have added. But like, you know, enough about how, what the potentials are like I wanna, uh, have our one of our customers who have used the service show you like how they have used AWS Transform to solve their problems and that would act like, you know, like a guidance for some of the challenges that you yourself may face and how AWS Transform can help you there. I'll, I'll invite Srinivas to kind of share those details here, Srinivas. Thank you, Nits. So we at Imia, we service 45+ DMVs across the country. Any one of you who has a driver's license in the United States, the chances are that we would have touched your life in some of the other form. This particular solution that we took through the transformation process is one of the critical products uh that we offer as a service and that's for certifying as you enter the DMV you go through a knowledge test and then a skills test and then kind of, you know, you go through the whole process of getting your driver's license as part of that this product was built some time back. And the legacy state was like kind of a typical monolithic application that we have been deploying for a while, uh, with a thick, kind of a thick client to WPF based application and then, uh, .NET, uh, framework 3.5 in the, uh, with a SQL Server database as the back end. Nothing fancy but kind of you know a critical application as we started kind of embarking on the journey of like trying to scale it up across multiple customers and multiple types of uh users that we had to cater to we started realizing that there are gonna be some significant challenges. These are some of the challenges, not just all encompassing, that we encountered that we needed some answers for. As we started ramping up, we realized that the technical debt was piling up with uh outdated infrastructure architecture based on .NET framework that was no longer scalable and uh limiting us from being able to containerize and kind of um move to the next level. Additionally, we started encountering higher cost of ownership from a performance and uh uh the legacy applications that were running on a Windows environment and could not be ported into a Linux uh setting. And uh we also started seeing some security challenges that we needed to address, uh, particularly with with the space that we operate in compliance is a big thing that we need to be very careful about because we deal with the PII uh on a continuous basis and also making sure that not only we're compliant with the regulatory standards, but we also need to be ahead of, uh, all those, uh, nation state actors that we need to worry about. So kind of, you know, we needed to think about what we need to do. And it also started kind of as we started scaling up, we started noticing some customer satisfaction issues were starting to creep up so customers started complaining that uh hey, you know, the performance is not at the level that we're looking for or we were hoping for what can you guys do about that? When we started thinking about, OK, we need to start transforming what we're doing right now. So we realized that kind of, you know, from a technical debt perspective, what are we looking at? The manual deployment process was taking longer than what we were hoping for. Um, the incompatibility with the Linux lightweight Linux containers, uh, that we needed to address and also the auto scaling we were setting up the environments for like kind of, you know, the worst case scenario but not using it on a regular basis, so which meant that kind of, you know, the cost of ownership was obviously kind of going through the roof and. The restricted uh integration for the CICD pipelines that we wanted to bring to bear. The cloud native capabilities that the team was hoping to leverage, we were not able to get any of that in place because of the legacy architecture. Additionally, we also started noticing that kind of, you know, there were some uh 32 bit versus 64 bit inefficiencies that we needed to cater to or we needed to address and memory management and the garbage collection. Those of you who are familiar with the .NET applications and who have used the older .NET frameworks, you would have definitely experienced this kind of, uh, pain points on a continuous basis and. If you ask me what kept me up at night, there were occasions where I had to jump on calls to figure out what was going on, and our team was not too happy about that. The end of life of Windows 2012 server also kind of accelerated the process that we needed to transform our application. And uh also, as I mentioned, the overprovisioning of uh EC2 instances and then uh the amount of storage that we had to overprovision, uh, I have uh my colleague also here who kind of lived that nightmare with me we kind of started thinking what can we do? OK, and 99% of the time we started realizing that majority of the resources were actually sitting idle and we needed to address that debt. The capacity, higher capacity needed during usage peaks, which were kind of not uniform, but kind of, you know, we saw the ebbs and flows of that, that we needed to deal with. As we started looking at these problems, we realized that we needed to tackle them sooner rather than later. The, as I also mentioned, a couple of other things in terms of the security challenges that we encountered, the TLS 1.2 versus TLS 1.3 support that was limited in terms of what we were having in .NET 3 3.5 and obsolete code access security versus the modern.NET 8 framework security that was, that's uh that was something that we were looking for. The weak authentication schemes that we had to deal with. Minimal protection for uh CSRF and uh you know, stack trace being very poor in D.NET 3.5 versus .NET 8 and uh insecure token storage practices that we had to kind of deal with as part of the 3.5 uh uh architecture that we had in place. So, with that kind of, you know, we set some goals uh for modernizing our our application and uh the service that we're offering to our customers. We started uh talking to some partners, uh, Cloud Hedge, uh, uh, and, uh, Amazon. We realize that we need to containerize as quickly as possible. Moving it to a lightweight, uh, uh, Linux container model. We needed to improve our security posture, bring down the total cost of ownership, and, more importantly, be able to go cross-platform, which was limited in.NET 3.5 that we were experiencing. How did we achieve that? We started talking, as I said, to Cloud Hedge and uh to Amazon and realized this is the application state, ideal application state that we needed to get to. Uh, as you can see, we started getting a little bit more cloud native, which was not the case previously. We needed to host it in a multi availability zone model, which was not the case previously. Particularly containerizing that antennas using the ECRs for managing those containers and then the EKS for uh uh the to store our containers. And we also as a part of the journey we started before the availability of the SQL Server uh transform platform, we started kind of migrating some of that into postress Aurora SQL. So as we started doing that, we realized that kind of, you know, the, there's got to be a better way. And that's when we talked to Amazon about the AWS Transform being the right platform for us to take us to the next level. Think of it that each and every area that we're talking about has like kind of a code base that's like, you know, unique to each DMV that we need to deploy and then we kind of factor in across 45 DMVs, that's not a simple task either for the development team or for the SRE team on our side. So that's when with this architecture what we started noticing was that. Uh, close to 4 times efficiency, as Nitz had already pointed out in his presentation, what we realized is like kind of, you know, that the team started seeing that kind of efficiency as we started transforming to the target state. The results that we achieved as part of that were like kind of, you know, the most important thing was for me was to improve the resiliency and the uptime availability with using it uh UKS uh containers across multiple availability zones. It has helped us actually to kind of, uh, have a better up time. And improved on the performance bottlenecks. As a matter of fact, as we started doing that kind of, you know, we realized that we were running into a little bit of issues on moving it into Gulf Cloud, we successfully kind of overcame that and deployed it into Gulf Cloud, which was a huge step forward for us. The 4 times faster pace of the application transformation previously the team gave me an estimate of almost like close to per uh per uh DMV we were looking at close to 6 months. So overall to transform the entire application we're looking at orders of magnitude of like 2 to 3 years. We all, uh, I'm sure every one of you here knows that we don't have that kind of luxury because technology keeps changing and we need to cater to the needs of our customers on a continuous basis. So with AWS Transform, it actually helped us complete the transformation of the application layer in like less, less than like kind of quarter of that time frame. So that's a huge thing for us because kind of, you know, the longer we sit in the older platform, it not only is increasing my cost, it's also like kind of you know keeping up the security holes on a uh continuous basis that we need to deal with. The reduced total cost of ownership, we started realizing that we're gonna get about like at least 30% in terms of cost reduction if we had to provision those extra resources previously. Now with the auto scaling properties that I can kind of set efficiently, we're able to actually recognize that 30% savings in terms of the dollars that we're spending. The modern deployment practices like being able to kind of go to the CICD pipeline efficiently that was lacking previously. Now we're able to reduce that by 35% by reaching the time the time taken is reduced by 35%. And more importantly, security. I'm sure all of you kind of uh have gone through some sort of a security nightmare as you're kind of building your applications. With .NET 8 we can leverage the newer security features that .NET 8 offers, particularly migrating our application from a 32-bit to 64 bit and be able to kind of take care of all those CVUs that we had to deal with previously proactively using the .NET 8 framework, kind of, you know, is a huge win win for us. So this is a kind of, you know, reaction from our director of software engineering. He had to deal with this nightmare application for years, and this is verbatim what he said as we kind of leveraged AWSs transform. It helped us speed up the full transformation by 4 times and more efficiently host the software on a Linux, uh, versus a Windows server. What does it mean for us from a business standpoint is that now, I can actually take this application and kind of go to a true ser software as a service model, which we could not do previously. Though that's kind of in a nutshell, uh, what we have been through as an AWS uh transform partner and the cloud hedge partner and, uh, Raul is uh gonna take us through how he helped us transform our application. Thank you. Plenty of time, yeah. All right. Let's see how that magic actually happens, how the AWS transform works. It actually is pretty simple. So, um, it goes through 3 steps. So first is analysis, followed by transformation, and then validation. So as part of analysis, it, it, .NET agent is essentially a deep domain expert and its intelligence is built on top of Amazon Bedrock models that we have trained. It enables code integration from GitHub, Bitbucket, ah Bitbucket, uh GitLab, um, and a few more other sources wherever your code resides today. The way analysis works is it starts with at first identifying the .NET version of the project that you have out there. It determines what are different project types that, that, that, that are there. And then, um, It looks at the code and the dependencies between different projects and between different repositories that you have provided it to analyze. So, once the analysis completes, it gives you a pre-transformation analysis report. And using that report, uh, you can look at what are the different things that will be transformed, uh, during the whole process. And, uh, you can look at the complexity as well for the, uh, for different projects that are out there in your, uh, solution. So based on the code base, uh dependencies, um, and the business objectives that you state, um, it delivers you a tailored transformation plan. So, that basically, that's where you jump into the transformation phase. So this transformation plan, you can actually edit. So it gives you some default plan, you can add on top of it, um what you want to do, um. Literally in plain plain English language. It's LLM behind the scenes, which understands ah what needs to be done and it transforms the code for you. Um, the transformation can handle different project types. It can handle your WCF projects, web API projects, console applications, test projects, um, and, um, it, it, it basically offers you to, to put some repository level configuration and you can provide third-party packages, uh, dependency as well, um, for the whole transformation to work and complete eventually. So in this transformation process, it first transforms the code, it tries to build it. If it doesn't build, it tries to fix it. And that keeps on happening over and over again in a loop behind the scene, till you have a project where, you know, it cannot no more do any, any other thing out there um using AI at that moment. So, once that transformation completes, it generates a transformation report, report for you. So in that transformation report, it shows you what all things have been transformed, um why things have been transformed. And it gives you another report, which is Ntsteps. MD, uh, basically a markdown file, uh, which tells you what's actually not transformed. And it gives you certain steps on how you can, you know, further transform it. Or, um, another thing that you can do is you can again run the whole transformation based on the knowledge that you have right now. Um, let's say, you know, some dependency injection failed, um, that you have implemented. Next time when you are again running the transform, In your transformation steps, you can add a custom step out there to run a dependency injection in a certain way. So, um, so that this time, you know, that part of the project is also transformed. And you can do, keep doing that over and over again, however many times you want to do. So once the transformation completes, ah, you can, um, it basically generates a new branch where all the code is, and you can merge it into your production branch. So as part of that transformation, you know, when it ends, it generates all that reports, the next step, um, of this journey is validation. So AWS Transform, um, it automatically runs your unit test as well. And, uh, and it tells you, based on those unit tests as well, how much has succeeded, what's failed, and it tries to fix that as well as part of your transformation plan itself. Um. Oh whatever it can. It also generates Linux readiness, uh report for you, which you can review and, and see if there are further changes needed in the code at that time. So that is another thing that you can validate. It generates a natural language transformation summary for you, uh, which is again, you know, a very detailed summary of all the changes that are, that are there, all the build issues that it, that it, it has identified for, for you to review, and then again, um, you know, you can further optimize. So, once the transformation completes, it also generates an email for you. So what basically that means is, um, let's say, you know, you start a transformation and it's, it tells you, you know, it's gonna take 3 hours. Let's say. You don't have to sit in front of your system. Um, you can leave it once you get the email, you can work on it. Um, so it basically is headless. So behind the scene transformation happens. You don't have to, you know, ah, keep your screen open or keep the project open. It, it happens for you and you can load that transformation, uh, once you get that email. Let's quickly look at, um, look at a demo out there. For the same. So we have two experiences here. So, first experience is actually in the console. And, um, and in the web console, when you start AWS Transform, you, uh you can create, create a job there for transformation. And the way to create a job, obviously, you can click on create job, but then at the same time, you can chat with AWS Transform ah to create ah some of these jobs for you. So here, um you can either chat with it or you can click on the guided experience. So, let's select Windows modernization because .NET is part of that, and then you select .NET transformation. So, uh, once you select what kind of job it is, you need to supply it the code. How do you do that? So, either you can upload it through an S3 bucket, or you can use AWS code connections. So the way AWS code connection works is there's a separate on AWS console itself, you can go and con configure your GitHub or GitLab or Bitbucket. Um, you can supply the credentials there. It is going to integrate there. And here, in the web console, you provide details about that connector. So, once, um, once that connector is configured, AWS Transform is able to pull all different repositories that are out there, um, In your GitHub or GitLab, uh, whichever source code repository you're using. So all these repositories um are pulled and then you can select the specific repositories that you want to modernize. The way to do it is, uh, let's say, you know, I want to modernize um this one, Bob's used bookstore, and then I know there's an, um, there's a dependent repository API test there. So I would select both those repositories. So that when transformation happens, it is able to find those correlations between repositories. And um is able to transform the whole code base better. So, uh, so once you have supplied these repositories, there is another kind of dependency, which is NuGet packages. So, uh, these NuGet packages, you can either supply those private NuGW packages through Azure Artifacts store, or you can actually upload these packages, um, through the, uh, web console itself. So, this, this is, you know, one of the most requested features that we had when we had our product in beta, where a lot of customers, they had these private NuGet packages and they wanted to, you know, ensure when they're transforming, those dependencies are resolved and And you know, now we are able to do that. So, once, once you have done that, you can review all the ah dependent repositories are configured correctly, you can um you can ensure all the dependent packages are configured correctly, and then you can ah approve and start that transformation. So when the transformation starts, it generates a lot of logs for you and you can see all of that. It is pretty verbose, um, and shows you all the things that it is doing. You can, again, you know, ah, you have an option to sit there or you can, you know, ah close it and come back and ah start working on the transformation again. So here, you know, um, when, when I was doing this transformation, ah, here you can see one of the projects succeeded and one of the projects failed. So, um, So the repositories which have succeeded, it shows uh what all has succeeded, and then whatever has failed, you can actually talk to the, um, talk, talk to the console itself in natural language, and it can tell you what all things you can do. It also generates a next steps um markdown file for you. which will have all that information for you, um, which you can, you know, again use and again run the transformation or fix a few things and run the transformation. Or you can use, um, if, you know, AWS transform is not able to transform after a certain point. You can use um other code companions like Quiro uh to, you know, continue the work of transformation and complete it. So this was our web console experience. We have another experience which is in the IDE Visual Studio IDE. So as a .NET developer, this is the default ID uh that all .NET, uh, you know, developers use. And um you can install AWS toolkit with Visual Studio 2022 or Visual Studio 2026, and you'll get, um get option to transform there. So here, you know, I'm starting with a, with a project out there, um, which is on Dotnet framework 4.8. And um And I've installed AWS toolkit out there. So before I can start the transformation, I need to uh configure AWS toolkit for AWB Transform to work. So for that, I can again go in and ah the way, you know, uh I had set it up with, with web earlier using IM identity um Center, same thing you need to do here. You basically, you know, give it identity center credentials, it all, it is all set up and then you can start the transformation. To start the transformation, you can either port a solution or you can port a project. So you can right click on your solution, let's say, and then you just say, you know, start the transform. So when you do that, it basically gives you two options here. So, um, so you can see the workspace here, and the second option that you see here, here is what's the, uh, what's the version you want to get to. So currently, we support .NET 8, we also support.NET 10, uh, we support .NET standard as well, uh, as the target framework. Um, so how does workspace help? So these workspaces that are out there, uh, let's say you have a team of developers out there, and they all eventually want to work on certain things in the transform process. So, So the, every transformation job that runs, it runs in a workspace, and that workspace can be shared with multiple people, and multiple people can then work on that transformation. So, uh, again, you know, when the transformation starts, it gives you, um, it starts with analysis and it analyzes everything. And at the end of analysis, it, it generates an assessment report. So you can, again, uh, it's the same kind of report that you saw earlier with the web. Uh, so you can look at this report on uh complexity of this transformation. Um, you know, a lot of times, you know, it, it helps with estimation, like when, when you're estimating, you know, how much time it's gonna take to, to eventually, you know, do the rest of the work that will be left. So it, it's always helpful to, you know, uh, to look at all this, uh, initial assessment report that is out there. And once, uh, once your transformation is complete, it also generates a report for you, which is the whole transformation report on what has changed in your transformation, why it has changed in your transformation, and it also generates a next step, uh, file for you. Um. Which, which contains all the things about uh if something has failed, what are the steps that you can take to fix them. Um, Or, uh, it, it might have, you know, certain things that where it might not be able to suggest to you what you need to change, but then you still need to take some action, so you can analyze them. And then again, um, Change your transformation plan, run that transformation again, and you can keep on doing that incrementally. So, once you have completed the whole transformation, at that time, all the files that are out there, um, you can, you can start merging. You can either, you know, look at them one by one, compare them, and then pull them into, onto your system. Um, you can say, click on save changes for a particular file, uh, and it will basically merge out there. Or you can select everything, select all and do a single merge, uh, easier, um. Easier option, but then you can, you can still review each and every file that is out there and what is, what is changing. And at the end of the transformation, you can see a newer framework. Um, that's, that's our goal. With that, let's move to um Let's move to and see, uh, see the full stack Windows transformation, uh, the new features that we have released, how they work. Uh, I'll invite PM for the product. OK. Thank you, Raul, and as well as uh Shaniva's father. So what we have seen is now for the .NET side, right? Like so the .NET transformation, like, um, you know, for how we are moving customers from .NET framework to .NET 8 or .NET 10. Now if you look at it from a customer objective point of view, right, like, and if you want to migrate your legacy applications, think of it as a three layered cake. We are now supporting web forms to Blazer from the UI framework point of view. We are supporting from the middle tier for .NET framework to .NET 8, but that alone doesn't help them complete the whole story. So what we have launched today in GA is a full stack modernization agent. So now we are able to handle .NET framework to cross-platform web forms to Blazer, but more importantly now we are supporting if you have a SQL Server, we are, uh, using the same agentic experience to actually transform them into Aurora Postchres, um, so SQL Server as well, so. The main advantage of this is that like customers who have all of these legacy applications, they can use the same mechanisms they are used to for .NET to start modernizing their SQL servers as well. And after that, once you have transformed your entire application stack, we are supporting deploying those into a sandbox environment so you can validate the whole thing, right? Like, and this is one of the big pieces of feedback that we have gotten from customers is I wanna be able to try, you know, like take this application, test it that it's working fine. And now that we have full stack, um, you know, like a capability of transformation, you can actually like put it in an environment and test the functionality. This is gonna help accelerate customers, uh, modernizing into the, you know, like the newer, uh, .NET 8, .NET 10, uh, kind of a world. And one final piece is that this whole service is completely free for you to use, right? Like this is, uh, this whole experience in AWS transform for the Windows ecosystem is, is free to use today and, uh, so yeah, we are definitely looking forward to seeing more use cases that's coming, uh, you know, you can build and how we can assist you on this process. So the same sequence that we had for .NET, right, like we have exactly a similar flow here as well. We are gonna do an analysis and then we are gonna be like, you know, like identifying the database schemas, the tables, the views, and the indexes that you have, and then we are gonna, you know, like start the migrating, um, you know, like those schemas and all the database related items, but more importantly, we are gonna also make corresponding changes in the application code as well. So that means now you do not actually have to go make changes to the application. So we, we identify the dependencies between your .NET applications and your SQL Server, and we, as we migrate to Postres target, we will make the corresponding changes in your application code. So you had like a fully transformed stack as part of this, and then we'll help you validate and deploy in a new environment. So this is the functionality we launched today, and I wanna make sure that like all of you are able to at least get a sneak peek at this. There is a session that we are, um, hosting tomorrow at 1:30 and like, uh, we have that information on this in the next slide. And we would love to have you there and like, you know, understand a little bit more and see what you can build and take it from here. OK. Yeah. And the interactive demo which Rahul showed, like you can actually get it from that uh QR code, and more you can see from our website. And the session that we are talking about tomorrow, the full stack, uh, SQL modernization, there is a builder session that you can actually get it. And also there is a, um, you know, like a breakout session where we would be talking about this as well. OK. With that, um, yeah, we, I'm just very, you know, like cannot wait for you to like test it and like, you know, give your feedback and uh where you would love to take this product next. Thank you. Thank you, thank you everyone for your time and your patience and I appreciate it. Thank you.
