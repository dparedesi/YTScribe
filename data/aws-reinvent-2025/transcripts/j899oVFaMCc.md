So hopefully you're in the right place. This is a discussion on the value of certifications to your enterprise strategy. We'll be talking a little bit about how certifications help the individual, but mostly we'll be talking about how they can help your company and how you can use them to uh gain benefits for your company. My name is Andre Zu. I'm a solution architect with AWS. Now, most solution architects at AWS um are assigned to a customer or perhaps an industry. I'm one of the exceptions. I'm associated with the certification team within AWS. Those are the people that create and maintain the certification exams. So when I'm not having fun here at Reinvent, my day to day job is typically looking at, uh, the exams and making sure the questions on them are accurate and fair as possible. And I'm joined here today with Augusto Strasieri, and Augusto is a customer at Atao Bank. And, uh, Augusto, tell us a little bit about yourself. Hello everyone. I'm Augustus Strasieri, executive chief responsible for upskilling and certification program at IAU. I truly believe the best way to empower people is through the transfer knowledge and today we will share a little part of our digital transformation journey. Thank you, Gusteau. So in the United States, um, last week we had the holiday of Thanksgiving, and it usually is a time for people to get together with family and friends, uh, perhaps eat a little too much. But we also catch up on each other's lives and see what everyone else is doing now my family knows about reinvent because I've been talking about it for years, but it's still kind of confusing to them because I describe Reinvent as this giant loud exciting party in Las Vegas with lots of people, lots of new things, uh, opportunities to try stuff out, and they look at me and they say, but Andre, you know, you're not really a loud party in Las Vegas kind of guy. And uh 360 days out of the year there, right? But for reinvent, uh, I love it. It's amazing. I, I, I can be an introvert when I, when I go back home, but for right now, uh, it's enjoyable to just, you know, bask in all of the stuff that's happening here. So here's a quick agenda. The middle part is the most interesting because that's when we're gonna hear from Augusto. So I'd love to see a show of hands. How many people have had projects in their company this year that they couldn't complete because they didn't have the right IT staff? Anyone out there that had, had that problem? Definitely some hands. So, you know, what happens if your project is delayed by 6 months? Uh, what does that do to your revenue? What does that do to your customer satisfaction? Does that give your competition opportunities to disrupt your industry? These are some of the benefits that we see for businesses to have certifications. I'm gonna talk through a couple of examples. Say you're a company that has a great security team. Your security team has already implemented AWS best practices. They have, you know, least privileged access in their IM policies. They encrypt their data and transit it at rest. They have short term credentials and they manage them well. That sort of a company is going to face less problems if they have to get into a new line of business that has regulatory requirements around security. Just because their security is also already pretty good, so much faster entry into new areas if you already are at that level. Another example, uh, machine learning and gene and AI, um, we have plenty of projects within our group where we're using these services and One thing that we've noticed is that on my, my time frames, my time frames to deliver on these projects is in our days and weeks, they're not months and years. That doesn't leave a lot of time for on job training. We expect people to have a certain baseline of skills to be able to be useful for these projects. There's always a little upskilling, but we can't train them fresh, and I've heard from customers that, um, other people have experienced similar situations. Now, you probably have experts in your company on AWS. They know every service that you use today, but they might not be that knowledgeable on the services you don't use yet. And if you um uh acquire a new company from a merger, if you move into a new line of business, they're not going to be experts um that they normally would be. Now certifications give you a baseline understanding uh across the board of of all the services used by that particular role. So even though they're not experts on new things that you're using, they will at least know about them and be able to direct you uh when you're to use them. Now this slide shows a lot of what's valuable for the customer, but I believe that when you provide value to your employees that that translates to value to the business. Training leads to retaining. People tend to stay at companies that support their careers and their and their knowledge, their knowledge increase. Competitive edge is measured by many things. You don't normally associate competitive edge with training, but a lot of, uh, the statistics that I presented today and that I've seen on the, uh, as well relate that people that are trained better are going to give you a competitive edge to your to your competition. So what are AWS certifications? For those of you that are unaware, a certification is essentially an exam. You take the exam either at a testing center or with online proctoring, and then at the end of the session you've either passed that and you hold the certification or you didn't pass it and you need to study more and, and take it again. Um, that's how our exams work. Like an exam is good for 3 years active. The icons listed here show the various certification exams that we currently offer. Now I'm gonna go through the tiers of these. There's 4 tiers. The top 2, the, the top tier is, uh, the foundational exams. You'll see that in the upper middle section here in gray icons. A foundational exam. Think of it as a foundation of a house. It's something. You often build upon. Now if you're a manager and you don't need to do hands on technical work, if you're a leader within your company, if you work in the HR department and you just need to speak the language, that might be the only certification you need. You might not need to go beyond that. However, if you're on a technical path, that won't be enough. On a technical path, that might be a starting point that you use to get an, you know, more technical certification. So if you look at the 5 certifications in the blue icons on the right, those are our associate level. We recommend about a year of experience to be comfortable taking an associate certification. That's a year of experience using the rules that the certification covers. Now we don't check you and see if you've done a year of experience. Um, we just tell you what most people like, you know, your, your individual mileage can vary depending on how, uh, how much you use the services. Uh, if you want to differentiate yourself from people with associate certifications, what most people do is choose the professional certifications. The professional certifications are significantly more complex and take more time to study for. We recommend that someone have about 2 years of experience to be successful with those. Those are in the blue-green icons to the middle lower, and then at the very bottom of the purple icons are the specialty certifications. So a specialty is something that um you know you dive very deep into a very narrow topic. So think narrow but deep. So you might be a solution architect, but you also know security very well. You might get the solution architect certification, but then you might add the specialty security certification to it just to demonstrate your knowledge in that field as well. So, what themes did you see so far in Reinvent? Uh, shout out. What's, what are some of the main themes that you're seeing at Reinvent this year? AI AI. Any others? I mean, I wasn't even out of the airport and I knew that the themes were AI right? All the advertisement in the airport was uh AI. Now, here's the interesting thing to me, machine learning and AI very important this year at Reinvent. It was very important at Reinvent last year. A little bit the year before that. So this is a pervasive technology. Uh, I've never seen a reinvent that had that, you know, such a focus between two separate years. So the AI and ML stuff is really on everyone's mind. A question I get a lot is an explanation of what the different MLAI certifications we offer, how they, how they fit into different roles. Um, again, practitioner, AI practitioner helps you speak the language of AI. You're probably not doing a lot of the work yourself, but you're interfacing with people that are setting up your models and training them and doing things like that, um. Then beyond that is the cloud engineer, uh, cloud learning engineer, or I'm sorry, machine learning engineer. The machine learning engineer might be training models. They might be training them. They might be, uh, running them on endpoints. They might be operationalizing a pipeline so that those models retrain if, uh, if they are not accurate anymore. That's the job of the associate level. And then beyond that is a certification we've just recently released that is the generative AI developer and this is a really exciting one to me. This is a certification for people that are writing the agents and applications that are used to do the AI work. So, they're developers, uh, usually, they usually um are experts in rag, uh, architecture. They're experts in, um, you know, embed embedding and vectorizing databases. Um, now, when we test you on that, we don't test actual programming knowledge, but we test programming concepts in that certification. Now notice that that one's beta. So a beta certification means we just announced it, we just released it, and we have not yet collected statistics to, uh, that we would normally use on our exams. So in a beta certification, you have a few more questions you have to answer, 85 total. You get a little more time to answer it, total of 210 minutes, and it's half price. So my grandmother, she would have said it's a great value because you're getting more questions and the cost is less. OK, Augusto, I would love for you to tell us about Atao Bank and their work here. Thank you, Andre. Hi guys, let me introduce Itauni Bank. Itahu is a 101 year history in transformation during the market. We have more than 74 billion market value. We are the largest bank in Brazil and the most valuable company in South America. Our digital transformation start in 2018. And we are running our operations in 18 countries including USA. As a retail banking, we run our operations across South America. Here, as I said, we start our digital transformation journey in 2018, and we define four main pillars to drive our strategy is design. Digital products. Technology And data these 4 main pillars help us to increase our velocity, our time to market, uh, reducing our incidents, increasing our quality, and delivering a best experience for our customers, reducing our cost. So we define these main pillars, and these main pillars help us to achieve the business goal. Our propose. I Serve our customer very well and keeping evolving in sustainability. So here I will share with you, uh, business information, business goals, what we achieved with the, uh, digital transformation, uh, program, and I really believe good teams. Good results so we can reduce our incidents in 90 to 90%. We increase our speed in more than 2,000% and reduce our unit cost in more than 45%. This number is so important, but behind that we have the experiences that we are delivering for our customers in creating a culture of collaboration with our teams. Augusto, what role did certifications play in this modernization journey? Andrea, for us in Tu certification is much more than passing exam because Certification and the transfer knowledge process help us to create a new culture and that culture help to provide an environment that team can achieve that goals by innovation, by collaboration, and we really believe the upskill process is not easy because every single day we have a new. Technologies, new perspectives and the team need to learn all the time. So creating a strategy to help the teams during this process, it's so important and we create this process and we are totally aligned with the process with the business goals. Because when I started my career, I, I remember that people said velocity. Quality and cost, you need to choose two. Or velocity and cost or quality and And velocity you need to choose, but now with the digital transformation journey we are living in a different world. It's not that our world, our velocity or quality or cost. We are living in the. And the world we needed to deliver softwares with quality and velocity and cost and efficiency so it's so important for us, uh, follow this my new mindset and here I will share, uh, the numbers of certifications and the collaborate, uh, employees already certified. We have more than 5000 employees already certified and 7000 certifications in the bank, uh, so you understand the size of the company. Itahu has more than 93,000 employees. 15,000 in IT. We have 15,000 software engineer, uh, creating solutions for our customers every single day, and our strategy, uh, ran across all the company from the beginners. Through the experts, so as you can see, we have a lot of practitioner certificated associate professional, and specialty. That's the, the way that we believe to increase new features, new products, and new, uh, uh, a best experience for our customer. And after that, the bank starts to play another kind of game. Could you imagine that Ita is the largest iPhone seller in Brazil? Why? Because we start, we understand the customer needs with the data, with all the other, uh, information, information, and we create products to attend the customer needs, so. People here who would love to see numbers like this for their company. What would you recommend they do uh in order to duplicate the success that Aau has had? OK, I'll bring some takeaways. It's so important to define the OCRs, KPIs, metrics, goals to support your journey, and it's also important that OR are tied with the business objective. Because it's not a certification by certification, it's not tech for tech. You need to create strategy to increase the maturity of the business. We create, uh, internal mentorship. We have more than 140 experts helping the beginners during the journey, so we have a very important collaboration process into the banking, and that's the reason why the number of certification scale a lot. We have uh re re recognition. This, this word is very hard to Portuguese speakers. Recognition, it's so important point we create uh a Pre awards once a year. We recognized the engineers that you perform in the best way during the certification and upskill journey. That's so important, but also important to take care of the disability people so we can change the culture if how the people are included during the, the process. So we have a special attention for people disability. I, I believe this is the main takeaways and now. I will share a little part of our Ita WSE wiki. We stop all the company, all the IT area, one wiki a year to make sessions, interactions that we had in this AWS wiki. 45 sessions, execucivi panels, keynotes, women in tech, and inclusion panel. And we invite the certification team to run the exams into the banking. In 3 days we achieve more than 300 certifications into the banking. It's very nice and we have a huge proud about this journey. And it's only possible because we work very together through ache and we are increasing our maturity day by day. That's it, Andre. Thank you very much. The the thing I love about his description of this is it sounds like a giant party. I mean, I would want to work for a company that's doing this. I would want to work for a company that's, you know, recognizing my certifications, recognizing my growth and supporting it, and that's a, that's a theme we'll talk a little more about. Here's a quote from George Brady at Cap One. I thought that was pretty powerful and it echoes a lot of what Augusto said. So how do you do it? How can you help set up uh a situation like this and what do you use it for? Uh, good employees are expensive. We recommend that you, uh, try to not only find new good employees, but a key theme for this is keep the good employees you already have. And um one way to get the new employees in, I'm not saying that certifications are a panacea for hiring. Um, I would hire someone based on an interview, but I might decide who I interview based off things like certifications. Certifications could be a way for screening interviews. Most companies have sort of some sort of a screening process because they have too many people applying, but essentially, you know, using the certifications tells you that that person has at least demonstrated some level of aptitude on a technology and. Then you verify it in the interview that allows you to phrase your questions in the interview with the expectations that you now have based on their supposed knowledge so you know if they come in as a solution architect professional, I'm gonna ask a different level of questions than if they come in as a cloud practitioner. So hopefully you make the offer, they accept it and they join your company. The journey or the use of certifications is not over there, not over at that point. Um, when someone is hired, inevitably they don't have all the skills you need. Hopefully they have a lot of them, but they don't have them all, and certifications can help you, um, verify when you've trained them to the levels that you need. I know at AWS when we hire in technical roles we ideally bring in people that have some certifications associated with that role and then we create an onboarding plan for the next half a year or a year where we expect people to develop the training necessary to pass the other certifications that are important for their role. Um, it's a good way to use it to, uh, to again validate how well your training is working. You're, you're paying for a certain amount of training. You want to see the bang you're getting for your buck, and a certification is a good way of doing that. So how many people work for a company that. Gives you something, gives you something when you pass the certification. Does anyone work for a company that provides some sort of a benefit to you when you pass a certification? There's definitely some out there and I think that's, I think that's such easy money. Um, because you know you're not paying that much and the company is getting a tremendous value back for the extra knowledge that you have. Uh, I have a friend who, uh, I worked with for quite a while. He was a, a network engineer and he was passing a, uh, a, a vendor, a network vendor certification, and he was late to work and you know, his manager didn't care that he was doing something important that would benefit the. Company his manager just cared that it was a few minutes late. Uh, he was early in his career, so such things were watched, um, and he didn't stay with that company very long. And the next company he went to rewarded him with a gift card when he got his certifications. So to a local restaurant he would get a, uh, uh, a, a meal when he passed a cert and again that's such easy money for the company. They, they benefited tremendously. Um, so performance goes up when you're using cert when you have certifications, and we, we recommend that people be able to take on new responsibilities. People have studied hard for these certs, and they expect to be able to use the technology that they've learned. So hopefully you can open up opportunities for them to do things within the. Company that they haven't hadn't done in the past and then mentoring. I loved hearing Augusto talk about the mentoring program that they set up, you know, how do you learn, uh, you, you learn a technology and you're a good way to develop uh to, to build on that learning and to validate it is to teach it to someone else. If I can teach someone else something, I know it really well, so mentoring is not just good for the people that are being mentored, but it's also good for the people that are mentoring. So another question I've heard a lot even so far reinvent, I know it's only the 2nd day, but we have a new thing called microcredentials. This is, uh, they're slightly different from those 12 certifications I showed you. Remember, the certifications are a test that you take microcredentials. I like the names on this. It says Serless demonstrated agentic AI demonstrated. The demonstrated part is key because instead of taking a test for microcredentials, what you do is you get onto SkillBuilder. And you launch the microcredential and then you have to do something. It creates the resources for you on an AWS console and gives you instructions for things you have to fix. It'll say, you know, this isn't working right, fix it. Um, if this is only halfway done, complete it. And it then gives you in the console to make those actions, but it doesn't give you hints. It tells you if you got it working or not, but it doesn't hold your hand. So you really have to demonstrate the knowledge in order to get that microcredential. And once you pass it, there's, it's time limit as well, uh, but once you pass it, if you pass it, you can then link it to your Credly account and put it on your LinkedIn profile just like you do your other AWS certifications. These tend to be very focused. So again, uh, Servili demonstrated is focused very clearly on Serverless and not a whole lot else. So useful for companies that don't want to do the whole certification but still like that part of the journey. OK, how do you implement this? Um, how do you implement something similar to what Augusto has done with Ata Bank? Uh, I believe the first step for most projects is a budget. Now the budget you're gonna have to plan is for the certification exams themselves. It's also for any incentives that you give the employees as they pass the exams, and then time. You know, ideally, you support your employees by saying, hey, we're we're we're blocking off 2 hours a week, a couple of times uh uh for you to study, for you to practice. Now when you're talking about the exams or purchasing the exams, if you have 100 employees and they all purchase exams and they all submit expense reports for them, that can be kind of a hassle. We also sell exams in voucher bundles, so you can buy a bundle of exams, get a discount from them, and then those exam uses can be assigned to employees, assigned to employees with an expiration date, and the expiration date actually works in your favor. I've seen many people who studied for exams and they're just afraid to, you know, to do that last step and take the exam, um, because they think to themselves, I don't know it all. AWS is a big architecture. Nobody knows it all, uh, but it's easy to get stuck there. If you know that your your voucher is only good for another month and a half, that gives you a really good incentive to finish up and take the exam. There's no, there's a lot less downside to that. Career opportunities, uh, again, career growth should be part of their certification journey and if you have people that are in a career that they don't want and they want to move to a career that they do want within your company, it's great to have ways for them to do that. Um, for a long time I was a systems administrator on on-premise systems and I moved myself to a solution architect, uh, in the cloud. Now these certs weren't the same when I did this path, but this is still a great way of doing it. Now, uh, there's nothing to say you couldn't just take the solution architect professional and be done with it, but most people are not comfortable with that. It's a, it's a fairly complex exam, and most people would want to take steps to get to it. So we recommend take the cloud practitioner first, you know, once you've got that under your belt, then solution architect associate, and then, um, solution architect professional. Similarly, for a cloud developer, You notice that the middle certification is still the same, but the ones on the side are different. We have a lot of other paths that we can share with you that are appropriate for different roles that might exist within your company. And then you, you've now given them the given them the uh the budget you've shown a career progression for them, you need to provide a way for them to uh get there. um, on the job training or a hands-on keyboard is always the best way to learn something. I learned something best when I'm building from it, but you can't always do that. So when you don't have work in your company to for all these people to do, what we recommend is that you use something like SkillBuilder. So SkillBuilder is a service we offer, um, SkillBuilder.AWS, that's the website. Some of you are probably familiar with it, some of you probably use it already, but it's our platform for learning and we, um, we have two versions of it. There's a free version with over 600 self-paced courses recorded in video that you can, you know, use from your laptop whenever you want, and there's a few lab sessions that are also available for free and then we have a subscription version. The subscription version gives you access to many, many more labs and a few other goodies. Now the labs, I think again are valuable because you're doing something. You're, you're actually making some changes to an actual AWS console, but there's no risk. You can't cause any damage to that console. There's guard rails set up so that it can only do the things that you're trying to do, and then once you're done with the lab, the console, you know, that account is essentially wiped out and goes away. Now we have labs that are based on uh gamified uh approaches. So if you are comfortable with that, those, those are great. We have uh labs that are team based, so you and teammates each have to do certain steps. We have some that are competition and we have some that are real life scenarios, so we have different modalities of those depending on how you like to learn. One of the other things I like about SkillBuilder is uh the uh the subscription version of SkillBuilder is we have full length practice exams. Now there's a lot of other vendors out there that can provide practice exam for the AWS certifications. But none of them are written the same way we write the certifications themselves. Uh, I, I, again, that's the team I work in. A question that's written for an exam could go one of either directions. It could go to a certification exam or it could go to a practice exam. It can't go to both. But my point is we write the questions the same way as we write the real questions, so it's a useful tool. Now, um, you know, if you want to use another vendor's practice exams, that's fine, but ours are a really good way of gauging if you're ready to take that exam. A mentorship program, um, again this is usually a pretty easy decision, uh, you know, we have Slack channels within AWS we use that for instant messaging and we have Slack channels that are set up specifically for providing help to people that are taking certifications usually the people. People that already have them provide the insights and um you know you get that flywheel turning because you've got the people that now are experts helping the people that are not experts to become experts um and you know, kind of a critical mass of learning, uh, which is fantastic. So you're here at AW or you're here at Reinvent. We've got a lot of booths where we would love to have conversations around this or anything related to it. Um, here's one in the pavilion for the developer community. Feel free to stop by. Um, I will be at the expo hall some in the certification area, and I would love any conversations that you, uh, would, would like to have there. During reinvent there's boot camps and spotlight labs that don't exist anywhere else, so if you have time, take advantage of those. Because you're here in Reinvent, you get a 50% off voucher. There was a time when we used to offer testing here on site. We don't do that anymore because we want people to focus on the content here of Reinvent. But if you'd like to go home and study for and take a certification exam that you're already considering taking, you can use this voucher for 50% off. And again, you know, your company may reimburse you for your voucher for your certifications, but save them a little money, can't hurt. So hopefully you've learned some things here that you can take back to your company and uh help them do a journey similar to how Augusto and Ata Bank has done. Um, it starts with you. You're the your your company decided to send you to reinvent and they're looking for you to come back with uh uh wonderful ideas for, for them. So, um. Feel free to uh to bring us in along the journey. The account teams with the AWS can help you with most of the things I've described, um, so you're not alone in it, but, uh, it does take initiative to, to get it all going. So there will be a um a place where you can fill out a survey on your application for this session and we'd love to hear from you. We'd love to hear what we did right, we'd love to hear what we need to work on and um any of it's great. Enjoy your reinvent, have a wonderful time and I'll, I'll wait here. If there's any questions, come on up and we can talk about it until they kick me out of the room. Thank you all.
