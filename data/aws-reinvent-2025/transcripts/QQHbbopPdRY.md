summary: "This session, titled \"Enabling Government to Streamline & Ensure Healthcare Coverage with Data,\" features leaders from Covered California (the state's healthcare exchange) along with AWS, discussing two major data-driven initiatives developed to improve healthcare access and retention. Kevin Cornish (CIO) and Glenn O. Young (CMO) detail how the agency partnered with AWS, Deloitte, and Socure to overcome critical friction points that were causing nearly a third of applicants to drop out of the enrollment process and to address the looming challenge of retaining members amidst expiring federal subsidies.

The first key initiative focused on removing barriers during identity verification. Historically, a credit-check-based process caused 33% of applicants—often those with thin credit files or data privacy concerns—to abandon enrollment. Covered California replaced this with a solution from **Socure**, built on AWS services like **Amazon Textract** and **Amazon Rekognition**. This new system utilizes \"passive verification\" (analyzing device data and biometrics invisibly) to clear 85% of applicants instantly. For the remaining 15%, a document verification step checks IDs against selfies with liveness detection. This modernization eliminated the drop-off problem, increasing the pass rate to 98% while simultaneously identifying and blocking 5% of incoming traffic as fraudulent.

The second initiative addresses the critical issue of member retention. With federal tax subsidies set to expire, many members face potential cost increases, creating a high risk of churn. Partnering with Deloitte, Covered California built a **risk scoring model** (using R on Snowflake) to predict the probability of non-renewal for every household. They identified five distinct audience segments—ranging from young urban gig workers price-sensitive to $10 increases, to older couples prioritizing continuity of care. Using **Generative AI** and LLMs, the team simulated thousands of message variations to find the perfect outreach for each segment. This fueled a personalized omnichannel campaign where emails, SMS, and even inbound call center scripts (via **Amazon Connect**) were dynamically tailored to the individual's specific subsidy situation and risk profile.

The results of these interventions were significant. The personalized outreach campaign triggered a 5x spike in call volume and a 125% increase in website traffic the day after launch, leading to a 3-13x improvement in retention rates over the first two weeks. The session concludes by outlining a roadmap for 2026, which includes deeper integrations between **Salesforce** and Amazon Connect to provide real-time AI agent assistance and automated call summarization, further enhancing the \"human-centric\" mission of the agency."

Hey, well, hi everybody, um, welcome to, uh, WPS 208. Uh, this is Covered California, uh, with AWS, and today we're gonna talk a little bit about, uh, the data-driven customer retention strategies, uh, that Covered California has put in place, um, uh, to help with, uh, customer retention. Um, I'm, well, let me go ahead and. Go forward here. I'm Chris Carter. I'm a senior sales specialist with AWS. I focus on Amazon Connect for public sector accounts in the West, and I'm joined today by Glenn and Kevin. Would you'd like to introduce yourself? Good afternoon. I'm Kevin Cornish. I'm the Chief Information Officer at Covered California. I run our technology that supports our, our mission that we're gonna talk about this afternoon. Hi everyone, I'm Glenn O Young. I'm the chief marketing officer at Covered California. You could probably tell because I'm the one that took the selfie. I wanna remember this. How many times do you get to talk to people with a bunch of yellow headsets, uh. For joining us. Excellent. OK, so real briefly, uh, we'll do, uh, uh, Glenn will do a quick introduction to Covered California. So for those that aren't familiar with Covered California, you'll learn a little bit about, uh, who they are, uh, some of the market forces and changes that have happened recently that are, are driving, um, I guess concern, uh, maybe, uh, amongst, uh, the residents and constituents of the state of California, um, in obtaining, uh, health insurance. Um, some different initiatives that Covered California has taken to drive, uh, better retention or improve retention, uh, for their customers, uh, and, uh, uh, marketing or marketing outreach, uh, and then we'll wrap it up with Q&A. Um, Q&A is not gonna be live today, so when we're done with the session, you can just meet us like up in the front or in the back, and we could take live Q&A when we're, when we're done. Um, so with that I'm gonna hand it over to Glenn. Thanks so much, Chris. Uh, hi again and thank you so much for taking time of your day to come learn a little bit about Covered California, what we do and retention and ultimately how, uh, our technology partners, uh, help us facilitate that. So before we get into it, if you're not familiar with Covered California, we are the state healthcare exchange for the state of California. Um, here on the slide you can see many of the plans that we, uh, connect people to, but we're not just Expedia connecting people to plans. We do much more than that, um, but I just want a level set, and, uh, many states do have healthcare exchanges, and for those that don't, uh, they direct their folks to healthcare.gov. Um What is our our mission? Our mission, as you can see, is really fourfold and so as I just alluded to, we do connect people to plans that's core to our mission. We want people to get covered, uh, that's in our name. Um, I pause like I just realized that, but I've known that so, uh, um, you know, what does that really mean? So it's our job, it's our mission to give people affordable choices, uh, that those choices are not just affordable but the plans and the coverage that we connect people to are high quality. Uh, we care very deeply about health equity, um, and what that means is closing the health equity gaps that do exist in our country and just really around the world, and we, uh, have the great ability to work with these plans and work with the plans that we select and work with every day to try and make sure that we're closing gaps for the communities that we serve and speaking of service across the board whether it's marketing or IT or our service center, um, you name it, every part of Covered California, we are committed. To the mission, um, truly and deeply ingrained in our, in our hearts, um, and that shows up in exceptional service. I do wanna pause and say, uh, a, a quick story if I could, which is on the very first day of open enrollment, um. At about one a.m. Kevin and I got a text, uh, from one of our partners here, Brian, who's in you can wave, it's OK, silently wave, um, telling us about the very first enrollment in the state of California, um, and you know, emoji emojis were shared, and I say that to say that I know that everyone is on the stage and the teams that we work with, including the partners that we choose to work with, we choose to work with people like Brian and and his team because that mission is paramount. To us and I hear we have an hour so I'm gonna tell you another story. It's gonna get a little more personal, but I want you to think about what that means in the state of California. My parents are immigrants. They came to this country with nothing in pursuit of the American dream. My father was an engineer and I think he'd be very proud that I get to stand in front of STEM people who are much smarter than me in the realm of STEM and talk about our mission. My father unfortunately passed away of cancer. He worked his way up to be an engineer, uh, a successful engineer. He could, he could have picked any plan he wanted when he retired. He did not pick any of the plans I showed you. He picked a plan where most of the providers speak Mandarin. It's a smaller plan, and ultimately one of the great traumatic things in my life is battling with his providers. And battling with his plan. And battling with anyone I could talk to to make the last few weeks of his life more comfortable. So health equity is something I say a lot, but for me personally, that's what I think about when I think about health equity. I do think about my dad. I do think about myself. But I think about the people unlike my dad or myself who don't speak English, didn't go to college, didn't have a PhD, don't have a son that can even try to do that battle that is the complexity of our health care system. And I share that because oftentimes we talk about these things complexity, affordability, equity for me it's very personal and I know that everyone at Cover of California has some version of this story that propels us to work as hard as we do. So thank you for letting me share that with you because I, it's not about me or my dad, it's about Californians, it's about the people we serve that's what makes us work super hard. To try and do whatever it is that we can do to help our fellow Californians and I can tell you from talking to people in other states and state health care exchanges the feeling is very pervasive. That's what we mean by our mission. We've been really good. At what we do, uh, 1 in 6 Californians have, have or will have been a Covered California member in their lifetime, whether they ever thought they would be or not, right? And 1 in 3, if you add in our partners at Medical have been. Served by Medi-Cal or Covered California, that's huge. Just think about that. I will say that there are people in this convention right now who do not think they will ever need Cover California. But 1 in 6 of them might. And it's our job to make sure, especially in that type of environment that they think I'll I'll never need that so I don't really need to connect with that brand. It's my job in marketing and many of our peers to make sure that that I hope that's true. I hope you always have an employee sponsored insurance, but if you don't, if you're laid off, I hope the first thing you think about. Is Covered California, right? That's the job. Um, and we have been very successful in reducing our uninsured rate from 17% to 6%, meaning 94% of eligible Californians prior to this moment in time have found insurance either through Cover California and Medi-Cal or their employer, right? Um, last year I think we set a record for 2, almost 2 million enrolled, which is very, very, we're proud of that. And at the same time this year is a different year. And so what do I mean by that? Our government was shut down and I'll get into that, but if you're tracking, then you know about the subsidies that are planning to expire. There's a lot of federal policy changes and broader landscape changes in health care in general that have nothing to do with decisions that we've made but make it even more complex and more scary for Californians. And so our answer to that starting from a year ago is really doubling down on telling the story of who we are from upper. I'm a marketer, so go with me, but upper funnel, right? And you guys know building awareness, building trust and working with partners like Kevin and his team and many of you in the front row to take that trust and awareness and turn that into action. That's where technology really comes into play. And so I want to show you a bit before we get too deep into the technology aspect our new brand platform which is for the love of Californians. And this is our declaration, our first spot, which is called declaration because it is indeed a declaration of what our intent is here at Cover California. We love California, but we love Californians even more. 60 countries in one state and the music of 200 languages. At Covered California, we believe every single Californian deserves healthcare that works. So let us haggle. Let us cut through the confusion. We're not a health insurance company. We're in it for you, because we are you, for the love of Californians. Covered California. In other places I do this, people clap, but I know we can't. So just, if you liked it, give me a sign, yeah, or you can clap. OK, we'll break some rules. Thank you. I wasn't asking for applause. I just wanna know if it was done. But, uh, uh, again, joking aside, our, our brand platform, our creative campaign, our tagline, which you will see for many, many years, I hope for, maybe even a decade, I hope, is for the love of California, right? That is gonna permeate everything we do from an outreach perspective. And it's great because although it's new it's not really new we have always loved Californians and we're just saying it out loud so people understand who we are and why we do what we do. So as we as we think about that, we wanna start showing you beyond the big brand and the and the pivot what does that love, how does that show up in this moment where uh we have to focus on some other aspects that we typically haven't had to focus on before. Thank you, Glenn. I'll clap for you. Oh, thank you, I'll clap for you. So, um. At Cover California we're obsessed by 3 things. The first is our mission. Glenn talked a little bit about our mission. It's to make sure that every California resident, every resident of the great state of California has access to affordable, high quality healthcare. He talked about some numbers when Covered California came online about 12 years ago, more than 17% of our state's population had no access to insurance. That means when their kid got the sniffles, they ran to the ER, right? That means that they were using very expensive healthcare options. In pretty inconvenient ways and they were putting themselves and their families at risk for immense financial catastrophes, right? Any, any health scare could take their car off the road, essentially their family's car off the road. So that number one is, is affinity for our mission. Number 2, our #2 obsession is consumer's experience. And so we're a state agency. We're an agency of the state of California, right? When I came to Cover California I was a little bit intrigued by people saying that the consumer experience is our North Star. It's something we're really, really obsessive about. I'm like. The government doesn't care about me. They, they care about me when they want my taxes, right? They care about me when I have to pay a traffic ticket, but otherwise they don't care about me too much. Covered California really cares about our, our consumers and our citizens, um, and so that's that, that customer obsession we're gonna talk a little bit about the consumer journey and how some of the technology we've deployed recently has really improved that consumer journey and the and the customer's experience. We'll talk a little bit about friction, which is the enemy of of a consumer's experience and what we do to reduce friction. The third thing we're obsessed with is, uh, information security and privacy. We have Glenn talked about 1 in 6 Californians have been through Covered California. We are also the front door. Our platform CalHERS is the front door for eligibility determination for the Medicaid system in California which is called Medi-Cal. So every year about 17 million. Uh, members of our, of our population, that's, uh, you know, it's close to half, 39 million people in California come through our system and, and either go to a Medi-Cal solution or come to Cover California. That means over time we've collected PII and some, uh, uh, other forms of health information on nearly 25 million Californians. So we're obsessed about information privacy and security. We wanna safeguard those consumers, uh, data. So I'm gonna talk a little bit about a challenge that we faced uh in the last couple of years that we recognized in that consumer journey. Remember, for the consumer journey, friction is a bad thing. We don't want it. We wanna push people through a workflow that gets them to uh uh a conclusion which is they're enrolled in a health plan as easy and, and smoothly and quickly as possible. So we found that, uh, the way we were doing eligibility determination on this platform called Calheres. Was, uh, was giving anxiety to about 33% of our population. They were literally exiting the workflow at that point. We did a little bit of digging and, and started to determine that this, this, uh, eligibility determination process we used, which was relying on credit checking was not something that our, our demographics liked, right? Uh, a large number of them don't have great credit scores or maybe even credit scores at all. Also, a large number of them just don't want to share that kind of information with the government or even have that conversation, right? And so we found that a third of our consumers would exit the workflow. They, they would come to our, our solution, our self-serve platform. They would do an eligibility determination and determine that they were eligible for some form of subsidy which would reduce the cost of that insurance plan. They would begin to do some what we call uh shopping and comparing health plan options between some of the health plans that you saw on the slide that Glenn showed before. And then when it came time for us to determine you are really who you say you are, so we know that that eligibility determination is valid. We would go to this credit check process and they'd say, uh, I want out of here. I don't like this. I'm uncomfortable. I leave and for the most part we never saw those consumers again, so a third of our population was leaving before we scored a goal, right? We were not able to satisfy our mission with them. So we began to look in the marketplace for a solution, and we've been on, on, on the Amazon Cloud for about 4 years. Uh, we've had a great journey from an on-prem solution, uh, when I joined the company 5 years ago to a highly tuned, uh, microservices-based cloud native, uh, taking advantage of, uh, uh, cloud platform. And so we initially started to look at well, what other solutions are out there that would plug into this AWS eco ecosystem and how could we take advantage of someone who we would trust because they're in our system. Remember that third obsession with privacy and security that we, we really need to make sure that this was, you know, uh, very sensitive information and a sensitive workflow. Who, who could do that? So we found a, a solution from Secure which uses, which does not use, uh, the, the concept of a, uh, credit-based risk score, um, and we, and we began to prototype it. It solved two problems for us. One was what I talked about that that exit ramp where 33% of our, our clients were just leaving and never coming back. The other one was there's a lot of focus lately. Both inside our industry and from the federal government on fraud, waste, and abuse, and so we were also looking for a solution that would solve some of the potential fraud, waste, and abuse. Issues that we may may have been uh experiencing on our system and maybe not even known about it so we picked secure. Um, and we did a deploy. Talk a little bit about some of the things that this did. So, so a very different approach to, uh, to validating consumers. Um, the long story short here is we were able to, I'm just gonna jump to the next screen because I like the stats here. We were able to, to, on the left side from a consumer experience, we moved to a seamless, uh, deploy in our system, worked with our worked with our solution, uh, again called Calhere's no, uh, no noticeable difference for the consumers. We had some very effective fraud and and uh and uh fraud deterrence components of this. So some of the statistics you'll see up on the right, we initially right off the bat found about 5% of the transactions that were coming into the system were fraudulent, and the system was able to to identify those consumers and, and take them out of the workflow. We also did the next thing was the passive flow of consumers through our solution. We are today operating about 85% of our consumers passively go through, meaning they don't have to do anything. We know enough about their biometrics, about their background and information from the secure secret sauce that we're validating them without any more action on their behalf. About 15% of our consumers don't pass that, and we go to another form of validation, and Chris will walk us through a little bit of that in a moment. But essentially in the end, 98% of the consumers are getting through this really critical step. We're being able to validate their identity. We're, we're eliminating the, the fraudsters that roughly 5% of the folks who are coming in trying to do something that was not right. And, and if you recall that problem we had initially that got us here, 33% of our consumers leaving and never coming back, never getting to an insurance plan, that's gone. We, we are passing 98% of them through. They're down the highway, they're going through the shop and compare step. They're finding one of those health plans that is affordable for their family. They're making sure they're getting the maximum subsidy, which is reducing the cost of that plan for them, and they're signing up for health insurance. And, and that's really important to us, right? We, we are still concerned that 6% of Californians. Who probably have access to a solution through us are not taking advantage of it. So this is a way of getting us back focused on that consumer experience. How do we make sure that we get more Californians insured that that we, we get to that basic human right, which is I have a human right to be healthy. I have a human right to access this amazing health care system in the United States and not be worried about some catastrophic impact on my family's finances. It's really, really important to us going back to our first obsession which is our mission. So I think I'm gonna give it to Chris. Chris is gonna talk a little bit about that step where the passive, uh, verification doesn't work, right? The 15% that have to go to some next step. He's gonna walk us through how that works. OK. Thank you, Kevin. All right, so as Kevin mentioned, uh, about 84% of the people that go through the system will go through what's called passive verification, and with passive verification, uh, the users will input, you know, personally identifiable, uh, information, so name, uh, address, other, other information, and through a process that Socure, uh, provides they'll, they'll do device analytics, um, and. And and a number of other things and to basically process all of that information passively to to make a determination of of uh that person's identity or not and again 84% of the people will pass through that not knowing that they've ever even gone through this process uh so it's it's great right off the bat, uh, but for the 16% that don't uh make it through that process, then they go to what's called DCV or document verification. And Secure provides this mobile platform or this this type of experience where you can provide a a government issued ID and biometrics in this case a picture um and they will uh Secure will use that to uh basically provide additional mechanisms now to validate that that person is who they say they are. Uh, so with like the photo that you see here, it's comparing that photo, uh, and, and liveliness, you know, like things like make sure your eyes are open or look to the left, look to the right, they're even checking things like is their shoulder up, you know, because your shoulder would be up if you're holding a phone in front of you to, to take a picture, like little things like that, um, so it's checking, you know, liveliness, it's checking your document and using AWS services which I'll I'll talk about on the next slide. But to to extract all of the information off of off of those documents and compare that to the passive information that was collected previously and again as as Kevin mentioned, the vast vast majority of people between these two methods are now able to get through this process uh and and not fall out of the out of the system like they they were before. A Little bit of an eye chart, but this is kind of what it looks like in in in practice. um, off to the right hand side of the slide are the AWS services that Socure is using. um, it's a uh uh advanced machine learning model, um, a lot of proprietary stuff that they're using, uh, behind the scenes to to provide their service. But uh some of the services from AWS that they're using to form the basis of that, uh, Amazon Texttract. Textract is the service that is used to pull the information off of the documents, so pull text off of the IDs or off other, other documents that that could be basically scanned. Uh, they're using Amazon recognition for the photo recognition part and the liveliness detection. So again, you can, you can say things like turn your head to the right or turn your head to the left and open your mouth, like you can do things like that to detect that you're actually. Looking at a live person and not a picture of a person that that might be on a on an ID, uh, they're using uh services like SageMaker to help develop their ML models uh again, I, uh, it's it's their service that they're providing, but they're able to build quickly using SageMaker um and and you know, uh, adapt and continue to develop the service and and make improvements. Uh, Amazon Pinpoint for messaging, so their SMS and email, um, this is moving to end user messaging. So if you haven't heard, Amazon Pinpoint is moving toward end user messaging. They're they're moving to that as well, but they're using the basis of secure is based on Amazon Pinpoint. And then as Kevin mentioned before, all of this is basically co-located in the same region within AWS as the Calheers app itself, uh, so it's a very low latency, uh, secure, uh, and, uh, allows access or allows the two systems to, to interact together, uh, in a, um. I guess a very efficient manner and secure manner. So with that We'll move on to case study #2. I think that's me. Glenn. All right, thanks so much. Great, so thanks again. Um, we're gonna now turn our attention to our second case study, and you've heard me mention retention. Um, that's not necessarily something that we've ever been really focused on that much at Covered California. It's always been a part, and I think if you were to step back and say each division, each department is doing something retention related, um, but really if you think about Covered California and and state healthcare exchanges, we are a transitory experience for most of our. Members, meaning our average tenure is 14 months, right? Prior to Cover California, I worked for one of those health plans. The average tenure ideally is as long as humanly possible, right? Um, so for us we're meant to be here in a moment in time for most people where they need us and then again, ideally in this country the ideal path forward is employee sponsored health care. You get it from Deloitte, you get it from Amazon, you get it from your employer, or you start your own business or something like that. So we haven't really had to focus on that that wasn't really core, right? But we do need to focus on that very much for all the reasons that I'm I'm about to get into um and so that created another level of urgency for us across the organization to really think about what is our approach and strategy to retention, why does it matter? It matters because we don't want people to go uninsured, right? And then how does technology and how does working together help us achieve that. So I mentioned a couple headwinds. I'm just gonna lightly touch on it, but um it's clear from our focus groups, it's clear from whether you talk about federal, state, city, it doesn't matter. We, I'm in the trust business we're in the trust business. If you don't trust, uh, Covered California, if you don't, if you read the news and it, it makes you wanna close down your app, it's very hard for us to talk to you about health care or really anything. And we see that in in not only our research but uh very widely published research and it's been that way before even this year, right? this health care system in general because of the complexity because of surprise bills because of access problems even dating back to the pandemic trust has really been a struggle for everyone in this space. And then specific to Covered California we've typically enjoyed very high brand awareness, but when you double click into beyond have you heard of Covered California, what do you know about Covered California? what do you feel about Covered California, the, the trend has been going down, um, and again that's even before what's happening now with the with our government's um sort of stalemate around fed federal tax subsidies so as a marketer. This is job security. No, I'm just kidding. As a marketer, this is the call to action, and this is the need, the urgent need for us to do something to make sure that people. Take the time to take notice of who we are so that we then have the right to pull alongside them and tell them all the ways that we can support them, right? um, and so I've mentioned this a couple times but um you know without getting super jargony there are tax subsidies, federal subsidies that are set to expire at the end of this year and the end of this year is quickly approaching. And even today, depending on what day you open up your your news apps, are they gonna get extended? Are they not gonna get extended? Are they extended for two years? Should we even have the ACA? This is the confusion that I'm talking about, right? And the end result in in human context is it creates a wave of emotions that ultimately for consumers means that many of them will delay any kind of action. And, and many of them will say it's too confusing. I'm just gonna wait this out. And again, the danger will be that that 6% unemployed skyrockets. Our own internal projections say that potentially if these subsidies expire, something like 13% of our members will unfortunately make that tough choice to not renew. And it wouldn't be because they don't know the value, it wouldn't be because they haven't had access to high quality affordable plans for many of them it comes down to their health insurance bills doubling. And having to make the choice between paying for food, literally, I'll say it again, paying for food. Paying for gas to get to work, paying for rent. Or this idea of healthcare insurance. And something that I believe after many years of marketing is most humans are bad at managing risk. Look at my haircut that's a great example. Don't look from the back, right? So, so when you layer that on with this complexity again that that goes to this moment in time where all of us at Cover California really have to meet this moment. Um, I summarize the headwinds. I would just say that we did 21 focus groups across the state, so this is not just an opinion, um, this is hearing from real people who really are struggling with, with this moment, and, and health care is just one part of their lives, right? I mentioned the other areas that we all have seen the effects of inflation and, and so on and so really again the strategic shift to focus on retention was really paramount and luckily for us as a team we've been thinking about this for at least a year. And we've been working as a team. Before this month for a year to figure out what we can do and then again stand up some things to to lean in and help and so what are those things right ultimately I would just point your attention to the bottom through all the wonders of technology and our partnerships and our and our wonderful team, many of whom are sitting right here. We are mining our own data to ultimately understand our customers and to profile the risk of leaving, right, so a retention model, a risk profiling that then feeds into segmentation and then on the left creates more personalized messages. More personalized, more nuanced messages, and I'm smiling because with my own marketing team, I, I, I think we all know, I will say, well, what do we expect from Amazon, right? Uh, not AWS but Amazon and, and what is that customer experience expectation that we have in for-profit brands in buying a car, in buying shoes, in buying an airplane ticket, those are the same fluid expectations that transfer to us, right? It shouldn't be this hard. People do expect us to know them and to manifest that knowledge into personalized outreach, which we historically haven't done as much as we as we could have, but we are now. And then how does that show up when you're talking to our agents and um and how prepared are our agents to also treat you in a way that's more tailored to your situation this is really the the unlock that this this work with um technology and with AWS and our partners have done for us. I'm gonna hand it over to do the triple click into that. Yeah, thank you, Glenn. Thanks. All right, so how does that work, right? Or what, what does that look like, these personalized messages, and how do you develop those? Um, so the team at Deloitte along with Covered California, uh, started working, uh, backwards from their, from previous data from previous enrollees, uh, they built what's what's considered or. We'll call it a risk score, and a risk score is really just the modeled probability that a member is going to renew or not, and a number of factors go into that risk score, things like a premium increase or the way that they earn income today like do they have a large salary or are they a gig worker. Their age, you know, like, uh, are they a young person, maybe very healthy, or are they older? Are they taking care of dependents or are they just taking care of themselves? So there's a lot of factors that go into this and when you look at past data, you can see how premium increases might have impacted certain audience segments and you can make predictions in the future about how. These changes that Glenn outlined a second ago might impact the members in 2026. So using R on Snowflake, uh, the Deloitte team modeled at scale across hundreds of thousands, millions even really, uh, people to develop risk scores and created audience segments, and I'm just gonna scroll down here a little bit. My notes. So one example of an audience segment um is a let's let's say a young adult uh age 26 to 35, uh, they live in an urban California city uh they have, they're like a gig worker or an hourly worker, and their primary concern is going to be the cost of insurance, um, a $10 to $20 increase in monthly oops. I don't know what just happened there. A $10 to $20 a month, uh, increase, a $10 to $20 per month increase would really impact them, um, and so they're primarily concerned about what what that cost is. Another, uh, person, I don't know what happened there. I'll just go back on here OK. Another audience segment might be an older couple, let's say 45 to 55, supporting dependents. They might have maybe chronic health issues in the family. They're obviously going to be concerned about price increases, but for them the most important thing is to have continued insurance, right? That's the most important thing. I think all of us in here have have realized, you know, that you don't really care about your health until it goes bad. and you wake up one day and your back's out and then all of a sudden health matters, right? Um, they, they're already experiencing that, so health insurance is, is very important to them. So with this, the team developed these 5 audience segments initially based primarily on what the impact of premium increases will have on each of these different audience segments that were modeled using then from that based on these risk segments. Um, then using AI, uh, created a number of customized messages, and when I say a number I mean thousands of customized messages, SMS messages, email messages, messages that are targeted to those different audience segments, and again using AI, specifically LLMs, we're able to um basically run simulations again hundreds of thousands of simulations using these messages against these audience segments. And they can look at things like click rates or open rates like model these like in simulation rather than testing these on on actual people. The power of the cloud here is that you can run these simulations at massive, massive scale in very short periods of time at extreme low cost and with it ultimately what you get out of it are. The perfect message for each channel like SMS or email for each audience segment, the ones that that person is going to open and click and it is going to resonate with the best, to Glenn's point, you want that kind of Amazon experience. You want the company to know you. This is that more personalized experience. And then I'll turn it back over to Glenn for what that actually looked like in practice. So, yeah, yeah. So, um, what I'm gonna show you now, we started with an ad again, my personal. Now we're talking about communications, and this is when we. Oh, can't hear me? Yeah, OK. I thought high five bet. OK, I was a real-time NPS score, like, uh, uh, um, you know, we talked, I showed you the ad, and here we are talking about retention and member communications. On the left, uh, is information we sent out starting from July, actually July all the way through September to let people know. I would draw your attention to the chart on the bottom. This is personalized to each household. What is this EPT. thing, right? We know that people don't need to know those acronyms, but we wanted to help people to understand in the case of this example you're getting a total of $500 worth of subsidy or assistance between these uh these two different sources of of help, and this is set to expire in December. We started sending that out in July. Uh, you know, pretty early on and in comparing notes with our colleagues across the nation, you know, we were all trying to figure out what to do to get people's attention and to really start to plant that seed and, and then I would draw your attention to the right which is enabled by what Chris just described, um, this, this email goes longer and longer, but it's basically, um, very tailored to each household, each segment. And what they need to see in terms of their even their choices of uh switching from different metal tiers, gold, platinum, bronze, so on, or even looking at different plans that sounds pretty par for the course. I don't expect you guys to do the wave for me uh maybe outside I can induce you to do that. I but I can tell you for Covered California and for our peers across the nation this is. This is big, right? It's us really again leaning hard into what is the customer experience that today's modern consumer expects from us but that frankly, uh, large government organizations often find hard to do, right? It is hard to do for a lot of reasons, but because of all the technology and investment of time we're able to do that and um. What I would say is that am I doing this one? OK, OK, here we go, thanks. OK, so that, that was the outreach. So now we've reached uh the people now they might have interest, they might have questions, um, so they might call, you know, they call back in and when they reached the contact center we wanted that that personalized experience to continue, um, so in a, in a similar manner as for the outbound campaign. Now we're, we're looking at providing that customized experience for the customer as they're coming back in, um, so a set of custom messages while a when a person calls in they, they're gonna basically be connected to a contact center in this case it's Amazon Connect for Covered California when they connect to Amazon Connect using text to speech. Um, we are basically, let me back up, we're doing a dynamic lookup in Salesforce to find that customer profile information and find that audience segment and that risk score that they're basically assigned to and then dynamically going into Dynamo DB to look up and find a customized message for that for that audience, you know, segment for that person. Then using text to speech and Amazon Connect we're able to play that message so it's customized to them. At some point they're going to get transferred to an agent, and when they get transferred to an agent, the agent is also going to get played a customized whisper message letting them know who this customer is and their potential risk. So now that agent is going to provide customized or personalized I should say, support for that particular caller when they call in. In addition, the Deloitte team developed a customer retention workspace for the enrollers, um, so that they have, um, like a set of like high risk or or at risk um customers that they can reach out to. And the ability once they reach out to them to then score or basically disposition them like OK, we reached out, they renewed, we reached out, they're switching plans, we reached out, they declined. So now gathering a lot of data and then that in turn fed into dashboards at the end that they, you know, now they have just a lot more information about how effective that these campaigns are. So again. Um, you're receiving customized messages now when you're calling in, you're getting customized messages and the agents that are supporting you are supporting you with info they know who you are and how to support you best. And the best part, maybe the best slide in this whole slide deck. Is the impact that that's created. Thanks Chris. I, I tried to steal his slide because if you spend enough time with IT guys you, you, you wanna become one so I was trying to steal your slide, uh, but you know from a results perspective, you know what, what it really ends up being about is what does it do? Right, it's not personalization for the sake of it. It's not all this work just because we think it's right or we think it's gonna pay off. And, uh, what, what we're sharing here is on the top part, these are immediately following the campaign, literally the next day after the campaign launched and again this is multimodal, so you have email, you have SMS, you have, uh, other things going off. We had 5x the phone calls that we normally would on that day. Um, we had 125% more traffic to our website and we had 40% increase in logins and we can, we can deduce that those people were looking at the plans that we sent that personalized information to, right? That's just the first day after this was sent and then when we look at the, the first two weeks after that campaign. It's basically a 3 to 13X improvement in terms of retention again, the goal is retention, right? So for people who experienced the personalized, the aggregate effort of being more segmented, being more personalized, we can see the payoff here and we're very hopeful that in spite of the price and affordability challenges, this is what the approach is that we're gonna do because we're not gonna give up on any single Californian, right? The hard math of it is that we can only do so much and at some point there will be for some segments a very tough choice which I've said multiple times and we don't pretend that any amount of personalization is going to get them over that tough choice because it becomes Maslow's hierarchy. It becomes prioritization for them in their life, but at the same time, who would we be if we give up on this? We're going to continue to do everything we know how to do. And everything that you can all out in the audience help us do to to fight to keep people covered and if we can't get them covered to fight to help them understand that we care about them, they should pick up the phone and we can walk through whatever options they wanna explore with us and so these results are, you know, they're not just sort of a vanity set of numbers for us they're proof that we're on the right path here in terms of our approach. I'm gonna do this slide because I feel like I can't. I'm just kidding. OK, so we'll talk. I've, I've already briefly talked about how this works, uh, but we'll walk through it again, um, so based on the risk scores and the audience segments, basically an encrypted CSV file was, was, uh, developed and built by the Deloitte team and loaded into Salesforce. So now Salesforce has a mapping of the customers to their, to their risk score to their audience segment. Um, when a customer calls in to Amazon Connect right here in the middle, uh, there is a lookup that's done through Lambda back to Salesforce to find out what, what is that customer's risk score, what is their audience segment, and then from that a look up to Dynamo DB to get the specific message that's going to be played in uh Amazon Connect again using the built-in text to speech function. Correct me if I'm wrong, English and Spanish, correct? OK, English and Spanish, uh, so that that message is then played back, uh, to the consumer while they're, um, uh, customer, sorry, while they're waiting in queue, um, at the same time, the whisper message for the agent is also being retrieved and, and it will be ready when the customer is transferred to the, uh, uh, to, to the agent. There's a lot of other services that were that were used to to build uh ultimately again I mentioned are on Snowflake earlier to to build the the risk scores in the audience segments, a lot of analytics tools that were used, uh, visualization like Tableau as shown here. Lots and lots of things that went behind services that went into this behind the scenes to build the model, but on a daily basis, on a per call basis, Dynamo, Lambda, Salesforce, Kinesis to stream out the analytics data to Varent today, all of these services are used on every single call, providing that personalized experience. And what this does, this is just the first phase, right? So the data is going to continue to be analyzed and looked at. Um, and again, uh, we, uh, we've, we've got the, I say we, uh, the, the, the, the team collectively, is, is analyzing the data, um, and this can be continually improved on, um, so just, you know, just really exciting stuff, so. So what's next? As we're looking out into the 2026 and and some enhancements that can be made here, one of the big items that stands out is an integration, a deeper integration with Salesforce, and this is really going to provide benefits not only for the customers of Covered California by providing self-service like deep like personalized self-service when you call in. Again, lookups can be made back into Salesforce and that personalized like self-service information can be provided back right in in the IVR, but also a lot of agent assistance, so things like dynamically providing answers to questions to the agent like live while the conversation is happening, a summary of contacts when it's over. So instead of spending 60 seconds or 2 minutes like typing up a summary of what just happened on that contact, just use AI to provide a summary of that contact and move on to the next one. That not only helps with that particular call, but the next call when that person calls again, now you can say, oh, I see you talked to this person and you talked about this, right? Um, it, it helps all along the way. Um, so, you know, just announced this week at at Reinvent. Some of what that looks like here, Salesforce contact center with Amazon Connect. An inbound call comes in in the Salesforce interface. An agent doesn't have to leave, so they're not working from multiple screens. They can answer. This is just a chat in this case, but that customer's record is pulled up, so now the agent has a view of of all of that customer's information, previous contact information, you know, everything about them. As they start chatting, um, this is not a Covered California example, so if you need help with generator installation, that's, that's what this is about, but, um, you know, I need some help installing a generator well live while they're talking or in this case it's chat, but this works with voice as well, um. Amazon Connect through Salesforce is providing answers to that customer's question or to their inquiry live and as an agent now I don't have to like let me put you on hold and go look that information up. That information is being brought right to the to the agent live in this case because it's a chat, they can literally just copy it and paste it in helping that customer. We could provide sources to that, so if you needed to dive deeper or you know look up more information you could. And down here, I kind of cut it off on the screen, but an agent could even just type in here and just ask questions if they wanted to ask deeper questions about about this particular topic. But all of this now is going to help answer the customer's question faster and ultimately you just provide a better customer experience for for customers of California. So with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin. I think just a couple of thoughts to close and, and to take away. One, we started this journey looking for partners, not for vendors, but for human beings who had affinity for those three careabouts I talked about earlier, right? Our obsessions, our, our mission, affordable, high quality healthcare is a right for every resident of the state of California. That second one about the consumer journey and trying to remove impedance or, or friction from that journey. So that consumers can get from point A to point Z fast, speedy, with no issues, and, and feel confident that they have the right solution at the end of that journey. And obviously, uh, information security and privacy. So those three careabouts, we have two fantastic partners in Deloitte as our system integrator and Amazon as our AWS as our, our infrastructure provider. These folks, these human beings have the same affinity for our mission that we do, right? Glenn and I are, are, uh, we're employees of the state of California and so we're here because we wanted to do this mission thing. We have two partners who are also here and, and we treat them like they're our employees as well, right? That we are all colleagues. I think the second thing is we, we, we spent a lot of time today talking about data and AI and ML. And it's really the transition or or translation of data into insight that AI and AL AI and ML gives us, that insight that actually drives action, right? The insight that that drives action like, hey, 30% of your people are leaving and never coming back. What are you gonna do about it? The insight that drives action of, hey, let's create a custom message and a custom outreach campaign that will get every single human being to think I'm thinking about you in this transaction. I'm thinking about your family and what your needs are, and I'm giving you a custom plan. And I'm explaining it in a language and and in a method that you can understand and take action on too. So, so it's that transformation of data into insight that drives action which is really at the heart of this entire uh the the two use cases that we provided. Anything else to add, Glenn? We're just excited to keep, keep this going forward, um, and this is just the beginning and we've done this collectively in a very short period of time so we're excited to, to keep charging ahead. Yeah, great, thank you for your time this afternoon we enjoyed telling you our story and we'll be at the back of the room if you have questions. thank you.
