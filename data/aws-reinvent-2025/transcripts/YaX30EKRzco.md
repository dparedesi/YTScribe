So my name is Jeff Klaus. I'm responsible for global strategy for our ISV customers. I'm based in Boston. I've been at AWS just over 4 years. My history's been in software and my team put this together and I'm very happy to, uh, continue and, and show you what we can do to help you. So this is an opportunity for international ISVs. We're gonna continue to help customers with, uh, growth paths. And as we do that, the landscape as we've heard at this session is, is continually discussed, uh, discussion around AI and how we continue to look at that as an opportunity to continue our growth path. And when we look at that, we not only look at it from a product perspective, but we're also looking at what areas, what regions, what customer types are we considering with that because we have another, uh, uh, a number of legacy customers or continued SAS customers that are looking at AI projects that they can pigeon into a new region specifically to test. It might give them a great opportunity to, uh, look at AI in that type of respect. We are continuing to grow as well. We opened five new regions in 2025. We're gonna continue that growth with some regions that are new that are projected in 2026, and the one that I wanna talk to you about that's gotten a lot of attention is really, uh, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. So KSA for short, we have a detailed demographic information and data behind the reason why we're going there. That information is also available to you as a customer that would consider entry in this region, and that is an area that we continue to invest in and we'll show you the portfolio that you can consider when you hear this presentation if you wanna consider that potential journey. But we know this is not easy. We know that there are risks. There's an investment on the customer's part to consider this type of movement. There's certainly a competitive landscape. You're not gonna be the only one when you land that has the product that you offer. There may be some differentiating advantages, but you are, are going into an area that that you might not be. You're unlikely to be the first. Certainly the local technology advancement might be different. There's different client demands, different client, uh, expectations, and then the other one that's really complex is a regulatory environment and how does that get, um, transferred? How do you manage that as a part of your operations? So with that background. I just had customers asking me about this for uh at least a year. I said we've gotta do better at this we've gotta be able to put something together that can continue to answer the questions and the objections that we get from customers about navigating this type of path and Global Passport was the name of the solution that's the umbrella that will be uh guiding this conversation, but all the components of of that will be, you know, within this within this talk. So this is a program that's essentially a one on one program where we come to you and we essentially give you this advice from the deep plumbing of AWS Reinvent gives you a little idea of how vast the scale is of AWS resources. Part of the challenge there is finding those experts who can address those areas that I mentioned before that are that are major challenges. So that's the objective that we're, um, that we're. That we're going to review and we've done this for just over a year we're still only at about 400 customers out of the thousands of customers that we have, there are some criteria that we'll go through in order to uh get into this program, but we're not only, you know, we're really looking at those kind of next wave of growth opportunities here in order to help with that trajectory in uh into a new region specifically. This is uh probably the proudest slide that I have on here from, from my team is that the customers that are in this program that are working through passport are growing at twice the rate of customers that are not in it. Now you could say, hey, those are customers that are looking to grow, yes they are, but we're facilitating, accelerating, we're putting fuel on the fire and helping to smooth the ROI to make it as fast as possible and guess what? those account teams are telling their peers, their peers are telling their the other individuals that they work with, and it's continuing to to work out. So what is it? Passport is essentially 4 different pillars that are designed to address those needs that I, I mentioned at the beginning. The first part is strategic planning. We're gonna go through each of these in a little more detail. Next one is technical readiness. We have some senior people that have done this before with customers that are in 25+ regions. We wanna make sure that we avoid those any future mistakes and you can learn from their experiences. And then we have a regulatory compliance element and then we also wanna make sure that when you land like wouldn't it be nice for you to have some pavement path uh paved there to uh be ready for go to market and understand the environment when you're um when you're landing. So the first piece is strategic planning. We have, uh, 3 wonderful partners that we work with. Think and Grow does the bulk of these sessions. They're the, uh, uh, the OG of partners that we've worked with here, and we had a relationship with Think and Grow prior to this because they help our customers with growth opportunities and, um, we've also been using ThoughtWorks for some technical, uh, deep dive challenges with customers and then we have EDT for, uh, public sector specifically. And what we wanna get out of this is really to package a plan for customers to um to have a strategy to to put together because there were times when I was asking a customer why did you just launch in the UAE. The response I got was, well, we got one customer that said they want our product there and my brother-in-law happens to live there, so it's pretty easy for me to go make that work. That's not a strategy for, you know, deep, uh, engagement in a new region so Think and Grow is made up of really mature senior operators that have experience at taking startups into new regions and each of these partners have different skills that can help you to pave and and build a strategy. Then what happens is that strategy gets uh components that are that are uh listed here we can talk about any one of these components and then you can add on some additional items if you like what you see. You can even have them help you with first hires in a new region. You can help have them help you with deeper go to market data. But the program components are really just kind of understanding the market fit, how you go to market, are you channel are you direct, what's your pricing strategy, all these considerations now we've had some very senior customers that are some of our largest customers come and say, hey, you know what, we want you to evaluate our existing strategy for this next set of regions that we wanna go in so don't think that. This is just for customers that are emerging or just starting out in this in this path uh we've had some other senior groups come and and uh and and want us to to evaluate what they're currently doing. So after that session, it's about a 2.5 hour session that we spend time with initially. There will be a report out that takes approximately 2 weeks, and that report is something that summarizes the observations that were provided, uh, during the workshop. It also gives you a set of recommendations and kind of a playbook for that next region, but it's also the next, next region, something that you can use as a. Template and evaluate for future engagements and give you that type of um confidence that you've got a third party that's taking a look at this and giving you some advice we've had customers bring that to their board we've had customers use this internally and say we're not saying this like this team is also saying so there's definitely some advantages to um the report outs and the guide for for understanding how this would work. All right, the next Pillar is really about technical readiness. We don't want there to be any surprises. Do you know that our regions we price our products differently, we price our services differently, we don't have every service in every region. We have some senior essays that I mentioned that will um that have gone through this journey with a number of customers and they come in and spend an hour with you to ensure that there are uh some best practices that are transferred. Think of this as kind of a well architected review for new region expansion just to ensure that your footprint is as tight and as modernized as possible before we start replicating it multiple times. Let's get the cost down as much as we can. Before we have to overcome those cold start costs to achieve a uh uh a a fast ROI, there's also security considerations, performance enhancements, so this is a session where we go where the essay senior essay will go through and talk about the, the opportunities in this, um, in this domain. So we wanna make sure you get the right uh servers in that environment that you typically use we wanna make sure that the the services and the features of those services are available in that region as well. So that is uh the the goal of the technical readiness session, the outputs are essentially to make sure that you are aware of what's happening and um we'll go deeper into that. By bringing up a customer so you don't have to hear it from me, we'll bring up a customer that's gone through this and uh we'll, I'm gonna bring up, uh, Paul Peterson who's the, the regional offering manager for Click and Click's had a great growth experience. I wanna have him talk about his experience with Passport. Uh, thank you, um. So, just a little bit about Click. So Click's been around for quite a long time. Uh, uh, I've got something like 40,000 customers, uh, globally, um, a number of product, uh, items in our portfolio, both, uh, client managed and SAS, uh, infrastructure, uh, Gardner, uh, Magic Quadrant leader in a, uh, a number of areas. Uh, and we're looking to, uh, over the last kind of 5 years, I guess I've been with Click almost 7 years, um, like everybody moving to cloud, right, moving to SAS. So, as we move our portfolio to, to the cloud, we are, are having to address our customers, uh, data sovereignty, um, residency, regulatory requirements, just as Jeff was highlighting, right? We have hit all of those in spades, if you will, uh, on how do we look to expand and bring our customers onto our SAS environment. So, a little bit about what we do, um, our, our main platform, uh, unlike our competitors, we have a, a comprehensive unified platform, um, where, you know, we provide everything from, uh, analytics to AI to, uh, uh, data management integration, so on and so forth, um, uh, on our overall solution. Um, from our, uh, expansion strategy, we've. This year, uh, in 2025 we've added, uh, uh, five new regions on top. I think we're now, uh, over, uh, between 10 and 15 globally. Uh, we've, we've done the UAE, Israel, Brazil, and France, uh, this year as well as expanding our US government, uh, uh, footprint with, uh, a new DOD region. Um, and in support of that, you know, we had a, a kind of a base footprint, if you will, uh, for each of our, um, of our regions. Um, we were trying to reduce the cost on that environment. Uh, for, you know, uh, Jeff to highlight a couple of things like the cold start, you know, we're ramping up our customers, those types of things, uh, as well as optimizing, uh, the existing footprint that we, that we have out there. So we had a number of things that we had in our, in a backlog that we were looking to, uh, work our way through, uh, already, but being part of the program, working with Jeff's team, um, you know, we had, uh, a number of, uh, I think 3 kind of primary items that. That uh came uh out of the hopper, if you will, on that front, that's helping us reduce the cost of our, of our overall infrastructure. So, the first one was to, to move to Carpenter. Uh, this allowed us to, um, uh, adjust, um, our auto-scaling uh infrastructure, uh, uh, to make it a little bit more flexible on, on what, what we are able to deploy, uh, give us a little bit more options from the, the instance type expansion that we were able to do, um, ability to take lowest cost compute, uh, within that environment as well. Um, and improved our ability to scale up and scale down, um, you know, based on our workloads and, and, uh, you know, the, the ramp period for, for that. So you can see here as we look to, to, to deploy the carpenter implementation, uh, we're looking, you know, some pretty significant numbers, right, uh, saving, um, upwards of $150,000 a month after we deployed this, uh, into our global infrastructure across those regions at that time. Uh, the second thing we did was to move to partial deployments. Um, we had a, a standard footprint that we started with where we want to be able to handle up to 2000 tenants in the, in the infrastructure. Um, and, you know, that, that, that was a pretty hefty footprint to start with. Um, you know, we didn't come out of the, out of the gate with, uh, customers like that. That's a ramp, you know, to get to 2000 is, is a decent, uh, ramp period. So, this allowed us to reduce the, the cost foot footprint by deploying a, a partial footprint, if you will. Um, and we have a couple of really high, high-cost items that are in there. One thing we call our one app per engine. Uh, implementation, this is for customers who have really, really heavy duty analytics workloads, um, you know, they're really, really large instances, so, uh, this gave us the ability to, to kind of shut those off and, and save a lot on the compute side on, on that front. So, uh, that was good. Uh, another aspect here was around, uh, capacity flags, uh, uh, as part of that deployment as well, and this again, uh, allowed us to save a pretty decent, uh, chunk of money, uh, monthly on, on those deployments. The third one, which is a little bit counterintuitive, but, uh, we, we adjust the chipset, right? We, we moved to uh AMD uh from Intel, um, that saved a fair, fair bit of money on that front as well, uh, approximately $100,000 a month, um, uh, overall across all of those regions on that front. The outcome, um, obviously we were looking for cost savings on that front, and you can see a big difference here between, uh, our, our German region that we rolled out in 2023 versus the UA UAE one that we rolled out, uh, in April of this year, uh, and overall 40K a month, um, cost differential on that front. Um, lower and that ultimately that is helping, uh, me as I look at additional regional expansion, right, lowering those costs gets us, uh, more opportunity to either invest in, you know, other things in, in the, uh, in the portfolio or in our case we're looking to expand further in 2026. We've already announced that we're gonna go into Canada, uh, in the first half of next year, and tomorrow we'll be announcing that we're part of the European sovereign Cloud, uh, launch partner program as well, so. Um, you know, it's giving us the opportunity to continue to expand and grow, uh, by leveraging the program. So, thank you. Awesome thank you Paul. So, uh, there's a great example of how we, um, take practical examples, uh, from past companies that have done something like this and see if that applies to a company that, um, that wants to go on this journey as well and meaningful reductions in costs at the same time we're also trying to grow revenue so you see there's a there's a great opportunity there. The next, uh, pillar that I wanna talk about is is regarding regulatory compliance. So in this area it's really just about understanding and ensuring that the the passport that you have is and the visa that you have is, is appropriate when you go to that new that new region. There are a number of different uh compliance standards. It also gets deeper if you have, uh, if you're in the medical field or in the financial field. So you might not be aware that AWS has ex-regulators, ex auditors that work for AWS. They're in a group that essentially is designed to help you to overcome and to navigate this type of. Uh, uh, these types of, uh, of, of potholes to ensure that you're aware and they're very familiar with AWS services, so they're, they're, uh, intertwined with understanding the requirement and how you can overcome that with, with the service. So these individuals will come in like I said, the workshop you've got the strategy piece you just went through the technical part we'll bring that technical person in we're not gonna have you uh go around all those individuals and experts come to you with this bespoke program and then the regulatory individuals, they also come in and they give you their perspective where do you wanna go? Here's what to look out for. We also have tools to ensure that you can pass regular audits in this in this regard as well. So that is the 3rd pillar and, and a, a pretty large, uh, piece as well that we want, that we wanna remove. The next piece is around go to market. Wouldn't it be nice to be able to be confident when you land in a new arena what that will look like? And I often equate this to, I think most of us have been into a new airport for the first time. You've been to that new airport. You're tired, you've, you might be jet lagged, you picked up your bags, you go out through customs and then you're in this sea of people and you have no idea where to go. Maybe there's a foreign language you can't even read the signs you're trying to find the taxi, you're trying to find, you know, the shuttle. where do you go? In the distance you've got this little sign it's got your name on it in the distance and you're like oh my gosh, that's so awesome that person's gonna show me where to go. I pre-booked that person to help me that's what this is when you land in Saudi Arabia and you wanna work with a local partner there, guess what? That partner is someone you can trust, someone that knows the landscape, they know the customers and the partners, so we wanna set you up with people that know that landscape. Strange. When I come here, I always feel like somebody wants to sell me something, whether it's here in the taxi or going anywhere, and it's hard to trust them, right? So you need to, uh, work with people you trust, and that's what this is. The partner program has a wealth of, uh, of, uh, capabilities that can, that can, that can offer you through marketplace or the partner network, and these individuals understand how to navigate that. So they use this matrix of different uh coal activities in order to help educate the AWS team, the local team, on your solution and kind of build some momentum and some discipline from. Uh, from how the best companies operate because they've operated and they've, they've seen how those companies work, so it's things like CRM integration, scalable motions around CSEL, and I'm gonna let some of them, uh, speak to you about this. So what we've done so far is that we've pieced together some partners in different regions that can help you. They know the landscape and as a part of the program we help pave that first instance we pay for the use and utilization of those individuals in order to get that first set of of opportunities um under the covers. Now the other exceptional data point here is that passport catalyst customers, because we call this final pillar passport catalyst, those customers are growing 65% faster than the regular passport customers. So you've got people that are not in passport and then you've got double the growth. For passport and then you've got 65% higher for people that are in Catalyst so you see this momentum here and what we're trying to build and that's uh that's the value of of where we're taking this. So I'm gonna have some partners come and talk to you about what they do, how they operate with their customers, and give you some uh specific customer examples. The first is, is Symbio. So I wanna bring up Justin and then he'll bring up Francesca and I'll talk to you about his. Experience with the program. Thank you, Jeff Morning, everyone. Thank you for being here. My name is Justin Eddie. I'm the founder of Symbio. It's good to have you here. Symbio is a cloud go to market agency. So we specialize in AWS co-sell and co-marketing services. And our goal, as Jeff mentioned, is to accelerate that journey to co-sell revenue with AWS. So, what we do is we bring together 3 services within the Passport Catalyst program. Those 3 services are here on the slide, partner marketing services. So, starting with that, we focus on your joint messaging and positioning with AWS. How can we clearly articulate that better together narrative to the AWS customer? Uh, to the AWS ecosystem so that we know you're landing that message with maximum impact and then build the content and the campaigns to tell that story and drive awareness. The second is the co-sell enablement services. This is really driving that message to the AWS sellers, as well as to the partner sellers to help them work effectively with AWS sellers and cosell, help them to understand the best practices and have the materials and toolkits to drive co-sell opportunities and joint sales engagements. The 3rd is the fractional partner staffing and so our team provides AWS enabled PDMs. Who can uh uh navigate the AWS programs and the variety of resources to help partners to unlock and qualify for these go to market benefits within the program. And we provide co-sell specialists who help to execute on joint sales engagements and to enable best practices for working with AWS on specific opportunities and expanding those. All three of these kind of come together in the Catalyst program to enable this virtuous cycle, which you see here, uh, starting with kind of partner-led co-marketing, driving the content, the messaging, uh, to drive lead acquisition and pipeline generation, that really opens the door to connecting with AWS sellers. Once you're working with AWS sellers, you build those relationships and the trust, opportunity by opportunity, seller by seller. You can expand that relationship through these best practices to other accounts, their peers, other sellers, into broader. Sales enablement and identification of other accounts and opportunities that you can work on and then repeat this cycle. So, all three of these services come together to enable that virtuous flywheel effect of co-selling with AWS. So we have a great example of this today. I'm uh excited to have DarkTrace, our mutual customer here, to talk about a real-world story about this. So, I would love to introduce Francesca Bowen, a VP of Alliances Strategic Alliances at Dark Trace. Thank you, Justin, and thank you Jeff. Um, well, it's lovely to see everyone and uh I'm really privileged to be part of this conversation because we've had an awesome experience with Passport, actually, firstly with Think and Grow, um, at the very beginning, uh, and then with Symbio, uh, when we really looked to kind of expand. Um, so show of hands, who is not familiar with Dark Trace? OK, only a few. Well, that's good because I love to just give a bit of a background on the story and the history because it's a really interesting organization. Um, Dark Trace was the first to apply AI to the challenge of cybersecurity back in 2013. This is before the big rage of AI and certainly before we were talking about AI and cybersecurity. And so what we do is we learn the behaviors of individual customers and we are able to in real time to detect and respond against never before seen threats. That's really, really helpful for our 10,000+ customers, but particularly in regulated industries like manufacturing, which is what we'll talk about today. Um, so yeah, we'll, we'll do, uh, a billion dollars in ARR this next year. We were listed on the London Stock Exchange. We've now been bought out by Toma Bravo, a big, um, PE firm in the US, um, and it's been an incredible journey, uh, with AWS. I'd love to just talk about the passport program. So, just again, show of hands, who is interested in passport, who's part of it today. OK, so it might be early days for some of you. Um, so what I would say about passport is the kind of the secret to success is gonna be intentionality, right? You've gotta be really intentional with what you wanna get out, um, of this program. And so let's think about the kind of the challenge for Darars at time, as you can hear, we're a British born organization. Um, and so we are managed by AWS out of the UK, which is awesome. That's where our dev is, um, but ultimately it means that all of our resources is in the UK and Amir from AWS and so just naturally, um, well, naturally alongside, uh, John here who runs our alliances, uh, in Amir, we grew very quickly in that region, but less so in the US, which again for our business in general didn't make much sense because ultimately we do more of our, our revenue, um. Out of the Americas. So we wanted to elevate the AWS partnership specifically uh in North America and we wanted to kind of mature that co-sell mechanism that can be so awesome, um, uh, you know, between our sellers. So what do we do and how do we do it? So ultimately, um, the passport catalyst funded, as Jess said, uh, the ability to work with an organization like Symbio, um, and that was really awesome because what happened was that we were assigned a PDM, so a partner development manager, with that kind of AWS specific skill set, and they really. And she, Maria, um, extended our alliances team and really helped us to nail down the better together messaging. That is the most important thing when you're going to market with AWS. So we think about back to the objective ultimately we were trying to um mature our co-sale efforts and so our customer in this is kind of the AWS seller, right? So we need to think about. How in manufacturing we, we, we uh decided to choose that industry because it's less saturated against things like financial services, um, how are we gonna help the seller sell more AWS or reduce friction to sale, ultimately leading to more revenue and again for Darttrace, you know what we do is we secure organizations particularly. Uh, in regulated industries across their entire digital estate. So if you think about manufacturing, there's a lot of legacy operational technology, uh, IT, and they want to kind of gain the efficiencies, um, and benefits from cloud but can be slower. On the uptake because of that security challenge. And so this is where data tracing come in, right? So we make a great partner to the AWS seller to really help drive, um, you know, additional revenue and help the customer transform towards AWS Cloud. So with that story, uh, Symbio built this brilliant, um, to AWS and through AWS, um, kind of assets that we still use today even after the campaign, um, they're absolutely fantastic, um, and then ultimately we package it up to, uh, create a very targeted marketing campaign into, uh, medium, large size manufacturing companies in, uh, the US. So what were the results? They're pretty good. I was pretty happy. Um, so, you know, the numbers speak for themselves, but I think what I'd like to highlight is a coup, well, 3 things that got me really excited. The first one was access into organizations that we'd never engaged with before. In fact, we had meaningful engagement with. 10 of the kind of top 50 manufacturing companies uh in America that we had never meaningfully engaged with, that's a a really big deal, right? The next thing is procurement, so I didn't mention, but of course we're on AWS Marketplace, right? And so really interestingly. Um, we did some, you know, pretty sizable deals, um, with manufacturing, uh, organizations on Marketplace, and, you know, 11, memory that I have is an organization that would have typically taken 3 months to procure, but again with, um, with Marketplace, we were able to do that in under 1 month and that was a very sizable deal. So we love that. And then the final one is that number 49. So as sales and partner leaders um in the room, I think, you know, we can all build the best possible programs, but at the end of the day, it's really about our seller engagement between AWS and Dart Trace. So we've got 200+ reps trained on the Dart Trace side, which is awesome, but 49. Uh, manufacturing sellers at AWS are thinking about Dar Trace and thinking about how we can help them, um, sell more of what, of what they want to. So for me that was probably the most exciting thing. Um, Jeff, thank you so much. Super thank you. All right. Awesome thanks Francesca. Yes, great example of how this can work, and I think, uh, the, the, the beauty of this is that you're really focused on Symbio can help focus on the process like here are the results, but the process there is about building the uh the maturity, the muscle memory of what does it take to get these types of results and if you can keep doing that going forward, uh, you know that gift is gonna keep on giving, so it's fantastic result there. So I also wanna talk a little bit about um where this is a global program we are testing some partners in in uh APJ we don't have that fully baked and ready to to offer we obviously are showcasing here that we have North America. I'm gonna bring up our partner that we use in in uh in EMEA and then we're also working with a with a partner in the Middle East, um, and that APJ is kind of uh in progress at the moment, but a lot of, uh, of interest there as well. So what I'm gonna do next is talk about um Connact and their story, bring up uh Jonathan, and then he's gonna bring up Max to talk about it, uh, his specific example of their working relationship. OK. First of all, Jeff, thank you for inviting us and being such a great sponsor and thank you everyone for attending. My name is, uh, Jonathan. I'm COO and co-founder at uh CA. A bit about our story. 7 years ago, I was uh Working for one of the biggest and biggest ISPs in Israel, a lot of hype around it. And following an investment by a cloud provider that we won't mention its name here. We were tasked to, together with Yuval, my partner, we were tasked to build cloud alliance. Uh, we didn't know what exactly it is, what it means, how the impact looks like, and, but we understood that there is a lot of potential in the scope, so we needed to double down on it and really understand what it is. So, this is how Conak was born. And what we do at COA, we support ISVs at all maturity levels. Uh, build their partnership, business partnership with, uh, AWS from early stage partners that need their foundation built from, uh, the basic programs as we accelerate marketplace and so on to better together story narrative. And the uh and the executive alignment to much more advanced partners that. Requires deep and deeper differentiation, uh, business development, global business development, and co-sale at scale. Since we established the company, we served more than 200 ISVs. We're based out of Israel and the uh UK and alongside the professional service that really provide 360 for all cloud alliance uh requirements, we develop our own proprietary go to market platform called Flow that besides connecting and operationalizing all the, all the systems also provide a data layer and insights layer to actually take the best practice that we developed internally. And expose them to, to our users. Regarding our partnership with the AWS, so it's really growing rapidly. Uh, we are, we are in multiple program, programs, but of course, the most important one is the Catalyst. We are in the 3rd wave of Catalyst, served more than 35, uh, uh, ISVs generated significant revenue. And a significant uh pipeline. I think that one of the most important things that we provide as part of the program is not only the fish, but we teach the ISVs how to fish. If there is a problem or something that doesn't work, we dive deep and find a source to enable them to afterwards either do it with us after the program or do it independently. Uh, I want to. Call to the, to the stage, Max, senior director of a global partnership at Riskified to Give his point of view on that. Thank you Johnny. Thank you Jeff for inviting me to come here and share, uh, the story of Riskified with both Connect and, uh, um, AWS, uh, and I'll try and do that in the next 5 or so minutes as well. I wish I was part of the session before, you know, a year ago, and we're looking into, uh, uh, starting the partnership with AWS, but I'm happy I'm here now, and it's very interesting to see the perspective of, uh, some of my peers, um, as well. So for some context. Uh, Riskified is a in the fraud prevention space of, uh, e-commerce. So essentially we work with the, uh, world's largest retailers in helping them approve more transactions in a safe manner and prevent, uh, fraud in real time. So we sit at the checkout and we help them, uh, assess the risk of those, uh, transactions. And uh the interesting piece here is that everything we've built as a company, right? uh since uh the foundation is on top of AWS, all of our all our data is stored up uh in AWS AWS we utilize a lot of the microservices and security mechanisms of AWS, uh, and so this question of whether or not we should expand the relationship with, uh, with the address is not, uh, necessarily new, uh, to risk a fight. But some of the two biggest challenges I think we we had when we looked at this was the first one is we are targeting very large retailers and we were skeptical about those types of companies buying. Uh, multi-million dollar software or services through the marketplace, right? Uh, we didn't think that was, that was a thing, uh, you know, Ris fight has very long sale cycles, very complex, uh, high touch, and we thought that, you know, someone wouldn't, wouldn't do that, uh, through this channel, uh, uh, we were wrong. And the second thing was, uh, just that we, we, we didn't know enough about how to get set up and where to start, right? And I think this is kind of the theme that we've been. Uh, hearing across the board, um, as well, and the advice we received was you should work with, uh, an external company that is specializes in doing this, right, that is taking, uh, potential ISPs like yourselves and bringing them to, uh, the marketplace, and they will know what to do if you committed the same mistake that I did in the past of trying to figure this out yourself and read through the documentation it probably got lost or thought this was too complex and overwhelming. Uh, honestly, probably is, but there is a, uh, a strategy to it, right? There's a way of doing it in a smart way and doing the things that matter first and then expanding, um, um, from there, so we, we worked with, uh, Connect to try and understand and kind of bridge those two gaps and concerns, uh, that we had. And from the first conversation we had with them, right? Number one is we again understood that we were wrong and multi-million dollar, uh, contracts were being signed through the marketplace and you know, large, large retailers, uh, we're utilizing that, um, as a channel so that was great, right? One of our concerns is, is dealt with, uh, uh, and no longer is there. The second one is, uh, connect really helped, uh, bring a lot of clarity to the process for us. We're a small team and you know we're doing what we're doing in a very, uh, uh, very successfully and so we needed to make sure that if we're putting resources and time away from what we've been doing, uh, uh, that it will, it will, it will be the right, the right call. So they explained to us, right, all the key milestones and things that we have to do. Uh, first, in order to get the, uh, the flywheel effect of the marketplace and, you know, AWS, uh, as a, as an ecosystem and so that's what we, uh, set out to, uh, to do. And uh also luckily we had the support from from the program that Connect had with the AWS and and Catalyst right in helping fund for that. So again everything we were worried about uh was no longer a big deal uh for us and this was uh being funded uh as well so we had nothing to lose but to try and make uh and make this work. So when we started working with Connect, uh, we put together very specific deliverables, uh, that we would be working on a time frame of 4 to 6 months and, uh, uh, that was also very specific in terms of what Connect would handle for us versus what would be required from, uh, Ris fights team whether we're just supporting with information. Uh, or we had to be, uh, hands on, uh, part of the process. Just a few weeks later, right, we had our technical review done. Uh, we were listed officially on the marketplace, and, you know, that was great news for us, but we're just, uh, starting, uh, that process. We didn't have a lot of go to market motion. Shortly after that, right, we finally got our, uh, competency approved in retail. Obviously that's the biggest, uh, industry for someone like, uh, Risified. And from there things started to catch up and it started to get interesting, right? We're done with all of the very important but uh a little bit more bureaucratic and technical steps uh that we had to accomplish and we did so in. In probably around a month and a half and we would never have been able to do that um ourselves. Uh, then from there we started to participate in multiple programs, right, that helped us collect additional funding, you know, our CMO was out very happy with the amount of MDF that we were, uh, getting as well and became, uh, an ISVA, uh, uh, very shortly, uh, during that period. And once we beca became an ISVA, uh, ISVA accelerate, right, that's when you have access to start co-selling. Uh, with AWS and you have access to the sales teams and you know here, uh, I heard the word being intentional and I completely agree, uh, with what you said that's the approach that we took as well, uh, um, in, in making sure that when we're pumping the opportunities through AC, right, that we're, uh, looking for. Uh, connecting or, or speaking or engaging with the sales teams, uh, we were very intentional, meaning we only submitted opportunities that were real opportunities that we had context background that we had something to share. We're not just trying to be overly optimistic and, uh, do a moonshot through that. And so when we spoke with those teams at AWS they clearly understood that we had uh some footprints. Some of those opportunities were existing clients of ours that were just looking to, um, you know, extend the contract or, uh, do an upsell or a cross sell and, and so that led to them wanting to speak with us again, right, uh, uh, uh, again, same thing here. They understood how brisqueide's deal could help them. Um, upsell their AWS, uh, services, uh, too, and so our information was valuable, um, to them. And just to close off here with some of the high level results, right, this has been 12 months or or nearly 12 months now that we finally decided to start this process. Uh, we have a pipeline of close to $40 million. We closed about 3 to 4 deals, um, already this year, which is a huge win again. Our deals are, uh, in nature large in size. And uh we've accomplished much more than than what we, you know, thought that we would, would be able to uh to do and we have a lot more to to to do now next year. So in 12 months AWS became a uh hyper growth engine for risk of fire. They were super excited to double down uh next year. Thank you very much, Jeff. Back to you Jeff. Spans yeah thanks, yeah, that's a great example when you talk about anybody who knows navigating FTR and navigating ISVA and what you need to do to reach ISVA to do that in around 2 months is phenomenal. That is, uh, great testimonial to how this can accelerate and originally. We were taking customers that were only ISVA and we're thinking why are we doing that? Now let's help some of the customers that have a great product. They still wanna grow. They've yet to be mature in the partner motion. Let's help them get there. So we removed that requirement and now any customer, uh, if you're not a marketplace, you can also use this as a, as a springboard to get there. So how does this work? We have a nomination process. You can go through your account manager. You can even just do a Google search for um. For AWS Global Passport, it should come up. You can nominate yourself there and then we have sessions. We've done these in 22 different cities. We try to come as close to you as possible. Um, we've done them all over the world and typically it's about once every 1 month and a half. So schedule that discovery workshop. You review the action items from the report that comes from, uh, the partner, and then there's, and there's a 1 hour follow up session to identify those next steps like that's the. That's the logistics of how this works as we schedule it. We do have a minimum revenue threshold. Uh, we have gone beyond ISV. We have gone to some startups that are below that threshold. If you have a, if there's a great growth story, I'm a sucker for that. We'll definitely take that into consideration. We're looking at success in the home market. We certainly want executive sponsorship. The maturity stages we've kind of uh uh changed that but we certainly want you to be in an APN and know what's expected because it is uh it is a commitment you do need to be uh prepared for for that path but as as we've talked we have individuals that can help you guide, um, guide you through that, uh, that path. Who do I want in these sessions when we have them? We typically say I want the person who's responsible for the target in the new region who owns the number to reach that sales target in that new area. That person's gonna really care about making sure that this plan is solid and then at the other, uh, the other side, I want the person who pays for that cloud bill who's gonna pay for that new region, whose responsibility is it in their budget to be. Um, to have those increases in in expense and take that risk. And we often see great debate happening between these people in these sessions. There's often a debate about where do we go first. We've had large customers come to us and say, Can you help me force rank the next 3 areas that we wanna consider growing in? OK. We've done that. We go and we have used partners to get data in some cases, or we've used some AWS data. What type of customer are you selling to? How can we help inform you to make a decision to, uh, to, to break that tie if, if there's a challenge internally? These are the individuals that we want in order to have that session. So this is summary. This is what we learned today. We talked about the strategy pillar. We talked about technical readiness. We have a regulatory element as well. And then we had some great examples on go to market because initially, guess what, go to market was our, is still our biggest challenge. When you land in a new region, you can put an instance up today. You can put a new instance up if you don't have those technical problems, you can open up and be available. But how do you generate sales and get that that uh motion working? that's the biggest challenge and that's why we are relying on some great partners in order to make that happen. So here's a path to the public site if uh if you don't have an account team covering you um this is a path to scheduling a workshop we do have some operations people that can help and uh that is how we operate. So anyway thank you hope you learned something and hopefully this uh this is something you can take advantage of. Appreciate it.
