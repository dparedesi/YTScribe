Good afternoon, everyone. So almost half of the reinvented to 2025. So how are you doing? Yeah, very good. OK. Let's start my presentation. So, uh, this is my, my title is uh Build a chart up for smart home appliances. So my name is Yuki Ogawa from Mitsui Erecy. So today I will show you, uh, our project. So the name is uh Kadenja. So Kadenja is a combined term, the combination of the, uh, caden in Japanese. So I mean, uh, uh, home appliances in Japanese and the Avengers. Maybe you know or heard of the US or maybe it's a superhero. Yeah, and the combination of terms of challengers. So Kaja is a chat, uh, sorry, let people interact with smart appliances, uh, home appliances, although they were family members. So let's move on the self introduction again. So, uh, I'm a, uh, I work as a developer on one IoT platform uh called Lenova, and I also work on a home appliances, uh, smartphone application called MyMU. So I'm honored to have received some awards from AWS and AWSS Japan. So community builder and uh Japan or AWS uh certificate and the top engineer in Japan. So I'm uh also active in AWS community. Both inside Mitsubishi Electric it called the mouse U M Electric AWS user Group, and XL one is a Japanese AWC user group Joe's and so I'm a louder in uh Kyoto branch so. I have our data services uh Kilo and uh Amazon Be agent core and so it's uh because so today keynote, so two functions are released, so the in agent core so. Yeah, this is the agenda of my presentation. Today I will cover 4 topics, the concept of the product, uh, the application, and the user experience, a short demo about 2 minutes, and, uh, after that I describe about the overall of the act. So let's move on to the concept of product. So IUD enable home appliances. Let people know these devices uh easily from anywhere and every turn, every, everywhere. From the user's side, this is very convenient and very powerful, but so when we think from the appliances side, the relationship is mostly command and the responses. We wanted to imagine something warmer and more natural relationships between the human beings and the home appliances. So our ins inspiration was the area of loving your home appliances more. So we imagine a world where users do not just command, uh, but talk to them about it and grow close to them almost like a family. So we designed the product challenges to engage friendly and useful interactions, not annoyance. In our application, uh, each appliance has an avatar and a personality that its function. The avatar responds to the user's, uh, command prompts in a way that feels, uh, natural for the devices. Avatars can also talk with Or creating and For example, so refrigerator might remind the oven about the ingredients for the recipe. So now I play a 2-minute video demo that demonstrates the experience. Yeah, that's the time. I'm Big Chill Taro. Ciao, I'm Cooney Breeze. Hola, I'm Bounty Vision. It's cold winter, so I recommend hot pot or warm udon noodles. Hot pot is great on cold days. Taro was recommending hot pot noodle. It's cold today, so let's watch something warm too. Brownie, that's a great suggestion. Yeah, to watch videos, so I want to eat uh udon noodle because it's a cold day today. So, yeah, let's move on to the, uh, explain about the architecture. So here's the overall architecture of the application calendars. So not only do we deploy agents for each application of appliance avatar, but we also have an agent managing the memory system and the memory calendar. So the front uses a reactor router and the GSAP and the Pixie JS, all of which are the uh called and uh built by uh Amazon Que developer. So currently unified to the name of the kilo. So conversation between users and the avatars. So I manage into Dynam DB and I connect to the front end uh uh via graphQL uh through AppSync. Additionally, since we often uh use a sub architecture, so the back end is primarily built around the lambda and the step function. So we have 4 features, so in this architecture. So I would like to explain about each features. So first one is a unique personality and the features of each appliance avatar. Each appliance agent include a system prompter and a personal profile that different its voice and behavior. So we also maintain uh, allowed to read so agent can call only above the device APIs. Per personnel can be uh turned it tuned for dialect and the top preferences, and we use uh Lisbon's template and uh safety constraints to keep rely, replies safe and appro appropriate. Agent can invoke external APL like uh uh switchboard APL in this case, so to perform diverse actions and react content-aware information such as the energy use or recipe suggestion. The second feature is a personalized knowledge base. Uh, we give a structured knowledge model using a graph database, uh, via Amazon Neptune. Not prevents userance and the performance which uh edges to capture relationship and the temporal context. So we combine little-based heuristics with learned model towards the importance of information and we effectively store only high impact memories of the every conversation. By analyzing conversation flow, agents gradually learn context and uh improve future replies. The third feature is a memory calendar. In the demo, so the, the last of the demos, of the, uh, I play the video demo, that one is a memory calendar. So conversations are preserved in later uh forms such as text summaries, uh, images such as thumbnails for mem memorable moments and show the video clips where when relevant. This great story-like memories that you can browse like a picture diary. So we also classify topics so the agent can retrieve relevant past interactions and enrich future replies. The last feature is a conversation mediator. We use a mediator to keep much of the conversation smooth and comfortable. The merit scores candidate replies for relevance, uh, confidence, and, uh, past personal fit, how personal fit. So it enforces constraints such as 1 quarters per avatar to uh prevent one avatar from dominating the conversation, blah, blah, blah. The meri the Asia natural turn taking and the very rapid crosstalk or flip rise so interaction feel calm and uh human. I think uh maybe they're always think about the why not using Amazon Bedrock agent core. So, yeah, at that time, we couldn't adapt it, adopt the Amazon Bedrock agent core at the time because so it was uh still pre-release when developed it. So, but many features it could likely be replaced by Amazon Bedrock agent core, I think. Agent core runtime runs the AI agent frameworks like a trans agents or agent core on Amazon Bedrock LLMs so which uh speed up agent housing and development. Agent core gateway uh covers the existing APRs run the functions into MCP comparable tools so agents can easily call diverse functions. Memory, identical memory, manage the memory access short-term and long-term stores, providing agent with the right content at the right time. So if you recall the video demo, so I typically show the interaction looks like this, a user asked, what should I cook tonight? So the refrigerator avatar uh checks the available ingredients in, in his inside and suggests option. It's not for the oven avatar, so which processes the recipe and schedule reheat, reheat. The mediator makes sure each of them speaks in turn and their actions are safe and coordinated. This flow shows how context aware suggestions and uh general personality can make a diverse interactions more delightful. To summarize, uh, challenges, so it is chart application, uh, to with, uh, so your home appliances. So turn household appliance into friendly agent with a distinct personalities. We combine uh agent runtime and, uh, MCP generates a multimodal memory to deliver context-aware and safe interactions. The result is higher use, uh, higher user, use, user engagement and a more challenge to user experience, uh, with reusable tools and the architecture that scales on AWS. Uh, thank you for your kind attention and if you have any questions, so yeah, please ask me, uh, over the, uh after the session. Take a day.
