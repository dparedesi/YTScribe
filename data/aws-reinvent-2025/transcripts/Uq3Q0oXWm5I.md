OK, so what we're gonna talk about today is ServiceNow, the AI control tower for business reinvention, and AWS, the world's leading cloud computing platform, together powering AI-driven workflows on the cloud built to scale. So let's talk about why AWS and ServiceNow. So, um, there are 3 things savings, innovation, and impact. And first, savings. So you can run ServiceNow directly on AWS Cloud. How many people knew that? This was launched last year. 1, OK, uh, 3, great, um, and so what's great about this is 1, you can, um, meet your data residency, your performance requirements, and burn down your customer requirements and be connected to your, your cloud strategy. This is a. Amazing for so many customers, they love being able to procure through marketplace. They love being able to decrement the PPA. If you have a cloud strategy, um, your governance compliance audience is so much easier on one cloud versus spread across a zillion different crowds and then innovation. So what we'll talk about today is we have over 100 integrations with ServiceNow products and AWS products. They are out of the box integrations. So any time you're using AWS site-wise, um, AWS Connect, um, Redshift, like you name it, we have an integration with a ServiceNow product, and many of our customers are super jazzed about that. DXE is one that is using that today, um. Then let's talk about impact. So this is all about accelerating time to value, and we've proven deployments, um, with Bell Canada, with Pearson, with DXE, with Boomie that, um, customers are, are already using these integrations, are excited about, um, how they're impacting their end customers, and, and, um, we'll talk about that more with the DXC, um, interview. So the next chapter of enterprise transformation is here. AI data and workflows all unified on one platform that replaces chaos with clarity. This is the ServiceNow AI platform where intelligence is not added, but it is built in. The big picture is that AI is everywhere and. It's very fragmented. Companies are racing to launch AI agents, and they end up with disconnected tools and scattered data. So ServiceNow brings that all together on the platform you already know, love, and trust, and we coordinate a dynamic network of AI agents that turn intent into action. It's powered by our AI orchestrator. It's governed by AI control tower, and it's your single command center for security, compliance and performance. So to make AI truly transformational, it needs connected data, and that's where workflow data fabric comes into play. ServiceNow unifies all of your structured, your unstructured, and um real-time data through workflow data fabric which is connected to AWS. The 100+ integrations that ServiceNow has on its own outside of AWS are um integration hubspokes. So think about Workday, think about DocuSign, think about Zoom. They're all integrated into ServiceNow. Zero copy connectors, so AWS Redshift, um. Snowflake, data bricks, those, um, those are live zero copy connectors that don't need replication, that don't need complexity, they're all just immediately plugged in and then, um, external content creators, so SharePoint, Slack, confluence, now AI can move across every function in every layer of your tech stack on one platform, one architecture, and one data model. So if you think about it, um, we have every industry covered. We have all AI all data, all workflows, any cloud and any system. So we don't just build AI we put it to work for you. So in financial services, trust is the ultimate currency. And in the digital age age we are all built on speed. So let's say a customer is filing a an insurance claim and um or reports fraud. We, you, I don't care about the back end silos. We just want to have results and we want to have the problem fixed to resolution as quickly as possible. So raise your hand if you have ever felt that an insurance claim is more miserable um than the actual accident and have paid out of pocket for an accident. OK, like a bunch of us because it is so, so miserable and that is something that DXE is, um, focused on, on fixing. So this slide represents the nervous system of the modern financial institution, and we're connecting AWS's intelligence with ServiceNow's action layer. So if we take claims automation, which is a huge area with a ton of ROI, in the past, um, a customer, one of us who has had an accident, would upload a PDF, for example. Um, and then a human would have to open it. They'd have to read it. They'd have to key in all the details, and it is a very slow, very error prone process, and it's extremely frustrating. We actually have a customer, um, who is an insurance company that pays double or triple claims on many of their insurance claims. So, um, so they would, they would, let's just say, you know, pay the person that's submitting the claim. They would pay the, um. The mechanic and then they would pay the insurance like 3 different claims and it's all backed up so they have I think I, I forget exactly what the number is but millions and millions of dollars that are just paid out the door that they haven't been able to track. These are the sort of things that we're able to fix with ServiceNow. Um, so let's just use this, this example, right? AWS Textract, instead of having a human read these PDFs that are uploaded by an insurance claim, Texttract is able to look at the, look at all of the text, ingest it through the AWS machine. Um, the policy numbers, the amounts, the dates with near perfect accuracy, and then the data is plugged into a workflow so no human has to engage with it. That data is immediately piped into service now. Um, we have what's called financial services operations, and it triggers a workflow which validates the policy limits. If it meets the criteria, it automates the approval and the process is out of a human hands and perfectly automated. Um, so this is about how are we delivering outcomes and no longer just processing transactions. So then we go into healthcare, um, and this is what it looks like in an actual hospital in a lab in the back office on the front end we have virtual patient assistants so we'll use Amazon Lex to understand patient intent. ServiceNow immediately actions that intent, books appointments for people, pulls lab results, and no human. Has to be in the loop on the admin side, um, staff onboarding is an extremely administrative, painful process for anybody who is in healthcare, and we slash the time that it takes to get a cli clinician credentialed and compliant by automating that data pull from A AWS databases directly into ServiceNow workflows. Um, device maintenance is actually one of the coolest, um, joint integrations that we have launched. So, and this is where operational technology plus IT has been saving lives. So let's say an MRI machine, um, is in a very busy city hospital and it's highly used. So every 10 minutes or every hour it is like completely booked out. What happens with Amazon, um. IOT site wise is that they have these little orange devices you snap that onto an MRI machine or any other machine and they can tell whether it's vibrating too much, if it's hot, if it's cold, and it will flag in the system that the machine's gonna go down. Um, in real time and so when this anomaly is detected, it's, it's not just, you know, logged into a dashboard that nobody looks at, it's then flagged to, you know, let's just say a database with ServiceNow, um, it doesn't just go to an email like, oh, Courtney, by the way, you, you know, your MRI machine is gonna go. Well, great. Like I don't, I don't have the machinery. I don't have the equipment. I don't have the tools. I have no idea how to fix an MRI machine. I don't know about you with ServiceNow we connected to the right technician with the right tools at the right time to fix the machine so that it is constantly running. It is fixed before there it actually goes down and there is no downtime. Um, this act this also happened, um, on the shop floor of a big car manufacturer, so they like to have a car come in pieces and parts and come out the door in 1 minute and 38 seconds. We were able to bring that down to 1 minute and 36. Seconds, which is actually a really significant time savings because the machines and equipment were able to go through that same process and get fixed before they actually, you know, they shut down, um, the, the full operations of, um, of the manufacturer so these are really cool integrations out of the box being used by our customers worldwide. I'm gonna bring up uh Daniel Sanovich from DXC. He is the regional GM of American Insurance, and we're gonna talk about Service now on AWS at DXC. Right Yes. Yeah, Thanks for being here, Dan. Thanks for having me. Such a pleasure to have you. So why don't you just give us a quick intro of your background, um, at DXE, and then we'll get into the partnership between. So just a bit about DXC Insurance because DXE is a big company, but I'm representing the insurance piece of that. So DXE Insurance is the largest insurance software and BPS provider in the world by pretty much any measure. Um, I run a piece of that business, which is our life BPS. I really focused on the life and annuity insurance, and it's really, um, back office operations for about 30 large life insurance companies in North America. Awesome, and you oversee over 30 life insurance companies, which is extremely impressive, um, both technology and operations. How are ServiceNow and AWS together helping you run and scale that operation today? Yeah, so again, if you from DXE Insurance standpoint, we're one of the largest insurance users of AWS. So we run, you know, it's our cloud hosting platform. We run what we call our assure platform on that. Which is kind of the connective tissue that allows us to connect into a lot of these like heritage policy admin administration systems that we interact with. Some of those we actually bring up and host on the cloud, which is an AWS, and some of them we just use the platform to access with with data. And then what ServiceNow actually does, so you think about it in layers, right? You've got. Um, the Assure platform and then what ServiceNow gives us is the ability to orchestrate work across those using agenic AI and then also has a workflow layer on top of that, um, so just from, you know, a technology view that's how we view it, but I think if you look at a bigger picture, you know, we're already such a large user of AWS, um, when we went out, particularly my business. I went out to look for something to help me simplify and automate a lot of the business that we do with the business process outsourcing, right? It's very people oriented business today, a lot of manual process, very similar to some of our customer shops, um, out in the market and you know, we looked at a couple of different, uh, providers of that technology, workflow technology. When you think of workflow technology, ServiceNow is really the first that comes to your mind. And when you look at the investments and things that they're making in the, in the AI space, particularly Genic AI, it was kind of the perfect marriage for us. What I love about some of the ServiceNow product offerings like specific to industries is we don't build anything unless there's true customer demand, so we find companies that are just saying we're building this ourselves because you don't offer it and then we realize, OK, we're gonna go offer it because there's true demand. Um, when you think about transformation in, um, in insurance, what measurable impact are you seeing in terms of cost to serve and productivity and claim cycle? Yeah, and I, I think just to build on your point, right, I mean, so sure, uh, ServiceNow brings us that technical capability and what we have is that deep insurance knowledge. So we kind of paired those two things together and when we looked at, uh, the businesses I support, um, we actually identified there's 127 workflows that support a life and annuity customer and we went through and re-engineered those and automated those, um, you know, with the partnership that we have with ServiceNow and we built, we're building product now on ServiceNow to support that. Uh, and what we're actually looking at is 30 to 40%, um, improvement in processing times and same percentages and cost reduction. So for us it's massive in terms of our ability to operate more efficiently, but then also really increasing our productivity and, and really driving a better customer experience. Um, for our customer, right? It's, it's, it's faster time to value essentially for our customers, which is, which is great. You know, you talked a lot about a claims process. You know, some of these claims processes can be 60 days long, uh, to get your life insurance claim, which obviously, when you're in that situation, 60 days is a long time. And so if we can find ways to shorten that using automation and some of the capabilities that ServiceNow brings and in combination with AWS then uh we can bring that down maybe to 1015 days would be a massive improvement for these companies and for the individuals affected. It's awesome. So you are building smart apps with ServiceNow. Can you talk about that? Yeah, smart apps, uh, again, am I the way I would kind of, yes, we are building smart apps and smart apps are kind of, um. Broken down pieces of workflows, right? So if you think about a workflow is a big end to end process, but what we, you know, and to implement some of that can take some time, right? We're, we're finding that out as we're implementing, um, you know, our sure BPM into our my shop today, which is kind of the full end end workflow, all 127 workflows I talked about. But what, um, uh, smart apps are is actually discrete pieces of value that we can deliver quicker, right? So if you, if you're an insurance company, what if I can just go and automate your submission process, right, your your application submission process so I'm not doing the entire end to end what we would call new business process just automating that piece which will drive a lot of efficiency, right? So if you're getting. T00 applications a month and those are manually provided so you know they're actually written on applications if we can automate the reading of those applications and the processing of those applications to bring speed to value to you quicker um that's really what a smart app is so it allows us to kind of incrementally deliver value in a a lot faster so in weeks versus. I maybe months, right, which is for us the real value. And how are you prioritizing those smart apps? There's 127 workflows. How many smart apps are there and how do you prioritize? You know what it is? It's actually customer feedback that's driving a lot of that. So we obviously interact with our customers quite a bit, and we just actually had a, a customer week, uh, which is a user conference down in October in Charleston, uh, and we got a lot of good feedback there and you can, you pretty much. Um, drill into a couple of key topics pretty quick, right? It's gonna be claims, it's gonna be some of the submission process I talked about that are going to drive some of those pain points. And so that's really what's driving it is the customer, customer demand at this point. So DXE is customer zero, both ServiceNow on AWS and of the smart apps. Um, how are you implementing them internally in your business and as you start to offer them to external customers, what are you learning? Yeah, so it's interesting. So again, we started our partnership with ServiceNow about a year ago. Um, and, you know, again, we've obviously been developing a lot of our kind of what we want to do, but we were initially started that we were gonna replace my existing workflow system and capabilities with, um, the ServiceNow capabilities in one fell swoop. Um, like it, like you run into in the marketplace, there's a lot of technical challenge to that, and it takes longer than we would have liked, especially for customer zero, and so we're still doing that, but in the meantime, what we've actually pivoted to now is doing more of a smart app strategy where we can say we can drip in. Some of this capability a little bit faster with smart apps and so now I'm actually able to deliver value quicker and again I'm replicating what we're gonna do for our customers, right? So I can say, hey, we've done this in our, um, in my shop and we're gonna, we've automated the claims, uh, submission process, right? We've seen these results and these, you know, and we can do it for you in weeks as well and just spin that product up while we're working on getting that whole end to end process in place. So I think it's um it's a massive thing and just in terms of being able to deliver value to customers quicker in areas that are really really causing them pain. Awesome. So last question, if we look ahead to the future, um, how do you see the combination of AWS ServiceNow, DXE Insurance transforming the future of insurance operations? Yeah, I mean we look at it as the perfect combination. I mean these are the largest players really in their respective spaces, right? AWS from a cloud hosting standpoint, Service now from a workflow technology eugenic AI, uh, standpoint, then DXE being the leader in insurance, um, software and business process outsourcing, uh, for us it was just like it's the perfect, um, combination of organizations to solve this problem in the insurance industry which again. Is really is a transformational um focus for us, right? I mean, insurance companies, especially life insurance companies have been doing the same thing for decades, right? They've made their problems worse over decades, right? They've bought all these different, uh, technologies they've kind of took process and added more process on top of that and where you end up is a lot of what we like to call capability debt. Right, which is, you know, you take all your technical debt and your organ and your, um, processing debt and add thats together and that gives you this capability debt. So it really hinders the organization's ability to, to grow and, and, and progress. And so if we can eliminate a lot of that by putting in some of this automation and geneic AI, I think that's gonna make a world of difference. Awesome, thanks so much for being here. Thanks for being a partner and um for those of you who wanna do a breakout session like round table with Dan, that will be an opportunity later on this week. Great. Thank you. OK, so now we're bringing up Ann Culver, I believe. If I can change the slides. Ann Culver from AWS. Hey everyone. So as Courtney mentioned, uh, ServiceNow on AWS has been available since January of last year, and, uh, we have a fully integrated stack, so basically a mirrored tech, a mirrored stack from what ServiceNow does on their own data centers, um, but the advantage with AWS is it integrates with all the other AWS services that we have to offer. So I'm not gonna read through these slides, but let's see if I can get this so that you can see it. So we have spent a lot of time trying to make sure that we've got the right integration so as you look at your orchestrated work flows across the enterprise, those interface with the services that you know and love and use from AWS. And I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna go into any of these in great detail, um. So just so that you can see obviously um one of the things we've been focusing on together is AI, uh, making sure that uh ServiceNow is able to provide AWS models through Amazon Bedrock as part of Now Assist so that integration has been complete, um, but it allows you to choose your own model and use it across the ServiceNow platform running on top of AWS obviously so you can see that there. One of the uh integrations that we recently announced is AI control tower with Amazon Bedrock Agent Core. I don't know if any of you are familiar with um. Agent Core, yes, hopefully it is, it is going to be something you hear a lot about this week, um, but it is Amazon's basically entry point into the AI world and agentic AI, um, so it's, it's meant to be sort of your one stop entry point, um, and that integration again with ServiceNow, uh, enables your agentic workflow across the enterprise, so getting rid of all that siloed data, making sure everything is working seamlessly across the platform. I think uh S3 was mentioned in another meeting I was uh in earlier today, but S3 is becoming and has been obviously a big source of data, uh, where we have a lot of partners including ServiceNow that are looking to enable customer S3 data across what they're doing from a SAS platform perspective. Workflow data fabric, uh, with S3 tables integration allows you to do that. So again, I'm not gonna read this because I am not an engineer, but. There it is. Um, the level of integrations is, is growing, so, uh, we've been working with ServiceNow for a number of years on the integration front, um, way before ServiceNow and AWS was available, uh, so you can see across the entire AWS stack where we've got integrations here, very, very extensive, and if you're interested in learning more about any of these, please come by the ServiceNow booth. We've got, uh, folks who can dive deep on each one of these with you. Another level of integration with uh IOT. I'll give you all a moment because I'm not gonna walk through this one. But you can follow the bouncing ball. Um, and, uh, at ServiceNow Knowledge we, uh, talked about, um, or announced zero copy connectors with workflow data fabric, um, so you can see here how it's meant to connect data silos, uh, obviously decrease spend, increased performance. Help with security, simplified compliance, and obviously con uh control your secure access. And again we've got folks at the booth who can walk through this with you. And that's it. OK, we're going to move on to a panel discussion. And I'd love to invite Courtney and John back to the stage. Courtney, are you joining or am I doing this? I'm doing this. OK, John, come on up. John Lucata, everyone from ServiceNow. Hello, hello. John and I do a lot of of fun discussions out there in the world these days, um. So we're gonna talk a little bit about how AI and Agenic is converging and what that means for folks using the ServiceNow platform as well as some of the advancements that we're seeing out there in the world. So let's start with maybe a technical foundation. Um, we're hearing a lot about orchestration, uh, and collaboration among AI agents. How do you see AWS and ServiceNow approaching multi-agent orchestration? Yes, so I'm glad you said multi-agent, um, because we live in a world right now where people talk about an agent as a singular, but we need to start thinking about expanding that in teams of agents working together so with Bedrock and you have access to a lot of different AI, uh, models which is wonderful, but I think we actually have to figure out how can we have like that single pane of glass, how can we access to understand. How could you look at maybe the AI control tower of Service now to help govern, put provisions in place, put parameters you don't wanna have, um, agentic anarchy. We need rules, and I think sometimes that's lost in today's, uh, talk about agentic AI is that we need to put parameters and guard rails up. Pretty soon we're gonna start to see audits happen when it comes to AI. It's gonna, it's inevitable. So I think one of the good things about how we're thinking about it together is how can we look at how you are leveraging AI models with AWS and how can you bring the enterprise lens in from service now so the whole better together angle, I think is definitely it's something that you've heard probably time and time again, um, what the last several days, but it's true. Because I think we bring the enterprise lens to the agentic opportunity in front, but I think that you have the, the cloud expertise that together I think that kind of expands your horizon of what you can do with agents. But I also think another thing that's important to note as we're thinking about the expansion of AI agents this still has to be humans in the loop we keep forgetting us we keep forgetting people so we need to figure out when there's more serious decision making that needs to take place. Maybe the agents do certain tasks, but there still should be a human in in the loop for the more complicated and so I think the orchestration has to be uh across different landscape and by landscape I mean. AWS cloud we both deal with on-prem and soft and SAS companies, and there's a lot of different players, and each one has their own governance model. So how can we help, uh, help each other by bringing, um, that's this, uh, amazing end to end visibility and transparency that's super needed today, and I think that's the benefit of the AI control tower and how we're already starting to see, uh, unlocking real value and I think that's something too is let's get value. And not just talk about agents doing X Y Z. People need to see results, but as you're building these solutions, it should be something that governance is in part of your, you know, uh, you, you're thinking of how you're gonna advance your models and your work flows. We need governance, and I think that's something that is, uh, an industry sort of push to do together but something I'm excited that we're doing together. We've talked before about the intersection of innovation. And governance maybe provide some thoughts around that. I mean, so much is happening in, in the world today. I mean, you have NIST regulations. You have Dora in Europe with operational resiliency, so many different things that we need to take into account, and I think that that expands the difficulty, I think, um, of what to do with agents if you give agents certain leeway to do a task, when do you take back the provision for to do the task, the security. Do you do it when the task is done when the job is complete, like there's so many different agents along the way it's not one agent doing the whole job you can have teams of agents doing pieces of the job and so I think that's the interesting thing is how do you maintain your channel checks and again human in the loop is important, but I, I can't emphasize enough this idea of AI audits. And how we need to start thinking not just of how work flows exist today we need to reimagine work flows and I think that's one of those one of the more amazing things when we speak and our teams come together is we start to think about let's turn the, let's turn the current work flows on their head where can we start to reimagine. The art of the possible. I mean, art of the possible is something that got us all into this, but what does that actually mean? I think orchestrating that and making sure that we can lead by example by delivering governance, uh, when it's needed, but also bring value to the table. I think we can't underscore enough that it's not just about saying the agents are doing X, Y, and Z. People want to see value. Today's AI agents are often limited by scalability and coordination issues due to lots of different reasons. Um, fragmented data pipelines is one of those problems that ServiceNow is solving. Maybe you can illustrate that a little bit. I'll give an example. Courtney earlier she talked about finance and she gave in, uh, uh some, some information related to the fragmentation around finance. I spent 20 years of my career on Wall Street. There is such a need for regulation oversight. And that's happening whether you have um currencies, digital stable coins a lot that's happening in the world today so with finance especially there's a lot of fraud. And I think identity management and fraud also need to take place but also now think about it in the world that we're discussing right now with agents there could be agent fraud. We can't just take for face value that the agent's gonna do the task and that's how we need to take it as trust so trust is something that's inherent, but in the financial industry it's something that's a huge concern that you have a lot of agents doing transactions who's governing the authority to distribute capital? That's why I think it's important to have the human in the loop, but Wall Street is one of the biggest areas and farmers another one thinking about, you know, personalized medicine and what you can do to deliver that and people's rights and personal data and, you know, HIPAA violations. So I think what you're seeing right now is a look into what could we do, but what can we do ethically and and bring responsible AI into the agentic equation. From a from that perspective and you look at the engineering task in front of us, right, um, there was something that I read the other day about the memory scale that we've got to now start looking at as well with AI, uh, has ServiceNow looked into that a little bit? So I think it's always important to, first of all, I, I, I have two young kids, so memory is becoming something I don't have much of these days. But, but I think, you know, what we're trying to think of, imagine a world where each of us has hundreds of agents. So I think it's great to use Gen AI for certain summarization capabilities and do certain tasks, but we have to be our own creative engine, and I think that's something I'm personally excited about as we work together is I think we bring the best out of each other, AWS and and Service now, but I think in first of all intelligence is only as good as you could use it. So it's great to have the visibility into data, but if you don't know how to interpret the data, you're at a disadvantage if you don't know how to put the data, um, uh, I guess I use it at the right time in the right place, you're at a disadvantage, you know. I was talking to someone the other day talking about intelligence when it comes to finance. If you had models give everybody the same sort of information, would, would the stock market just be flat? And I, I took a moment to think about this, looking back into my earlier parts of my career and think about it. All there's a lot of investment banks that have had, uh, you know, program trading around for over two decades. Some hedge funds lose money. Some hedge funds make money. It's how you interpret the data. So I think with when it comes to the future of agents, we have to start to bring in contextuality into this too because we all consume information differently. So just to say here's the blanket data we're all gonna have the same results I think is is not the right frame of mind we need to think about the contextual nature of agents and that's gonna take time but this is part of the research that has to um be brought forward is how do we train agents to think like us and it's not so easy to say that um you know I think we need to figure out what we really want the agents to do and they might know certain pieces of information. And I think this is where we're gonna see an evolution. We don't need to like, we don't need to give that agent everything about us. They need, uh, or in every part of the business ecosystem, they need to do one thing and one thing right repetitively and at scale, and I think that's where I, we're gonna start to see, you know, specialist the way we have in our own human jobs. We have specialists who do different things. Agents gonna become specialists, and I think so intelligence only as good as you can use it, and I look forward to seeing how we evolve that together. So smarter resource allocation, right? Um, many enterprises are still guessing how many agents or humans to allocate towards a project from your standpoint, sorry, that was my ringer too, so I'm like, wait, what? Um, how are AWS and ServiceNow working together to bring data-driven benchmarking to agents and, and human resource planning? What does that mean for productivity and budget? I, I think it's uh. It's, it's a marvel when you start to think about. How many agents do you actually need to do a job? I think it's a complicated question. When we, when we refer to agents, it's taken for granted. Is it 7 agents? Is it 20 agents? Is it 3 humans? Is it 5 humans? So I think right now it's been a guessing game, and that's hurt people who have allocated money towards AI seeking faster returns because they actually are not allocating the proper amount and what the beauty of our relationship is to explore what could that look like. And so it's exciting to know that we're both committed to exploring that together because I think if we have the benchmarking put in place it can allow you as developers and engineers the ability to make better decisions with prototyping too and see what works and what doesn't and right now that's a guessing game and we all know that we have to show um tangible results so I think benchmarking it's something that I look forward to in the new year which is not that far away. Uh, the both of us coming forward together with academic partnerships, uh, because I think that we need to ground everything that we're discussing in research and one of the beauties of our relationship is we don't go for the, the hype headline. And I do think that the industry has been hurt by a lot of headlines and uh for us I think we as ServiceNow and AWS have come together we're trying to figure out how can we actually support what we're saying. So I like the methodical approach of taking research and turning research into validity and validity into action that we both could benefit from. So that's been, uh, a wonderful thing. So they say you, what, what stays in, in what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. I'm happy that that goes beyond the world because with the, we're doing some bright things together. Well, it's a great segue. Um, we are working together towards an academic partnership, ServiceNow AWS and, and a well known institution. Um, to experience, experiment more with technology so that we've got some benchmarking, maybe walk the audience through why we're doing this together and what the outcome we're expecting to get. Yeah, I mean this is the fun part of the conversation for me is, so I think it's interesting because AI is fantastic. It also has limitations and so as we are thinking about how do we help you become more future ready as you're delivering. Solutions to your customers and in your businesses we are looking actively at the role of quantum computing plus AI. So quantum plus AI in the role of agents, um, there's a lot of opportunities that we foresee that the, the, the agentic ecosystem is only beginning. There's a lot to happen and again teams of agents operating in different landscapes again across. SAS companies on-prem businesses as well as uh in the cloud and we need to figure out how we can manage this better, how we can attack more difficult problems so Quantum will absolutely not be used for everything, but we do believe there is a future where certain business cases makes sense to explore and the endeavor that we have with AWS is to look at the. Use cases see what makes the most sense again grounded in research and validity but bring it forward in a way that we are confident that it can help people and I think that goes back to our mutual roots of helping people and putting AI to work for people so quantum plus AI it's exciting to look at the role of simulation what we might be able to do in natural disaster relief. Or in the financial space but beyond look at personalized medicine things that we might be able to look at individuals versus the mass and so we feel even with supply chain and logistics I mean who would have thought a few years ago, uh, uh, there would have been a vessel stuck in the Suez Canal and it crippled global trade for many days we need to start anticipating more and having that modeling. More advanced digital twins so we do feel like there's a component that needs to be looked at for better decision making and we hope that that that enterprise lens with a quantum plus AI story is beneficial to those using AWS as well as ServiceNow. So on that quantum computing track, how do you see quantum computing shaping industry moving forward or industries? Yeah, I mean, I think, well, first of all, I mean, look at you and if you're based here in the United States there's mandates out of the White House there's new regulations out of out of NIST financial companies will have to be reporting more on quantum readiness companies that we've been speaking to, um, have already. Said that the way people report on Wall Street for sustainability initiatives may soon have to report quantum readiness and we're excited that we published uh not uh not too long ago, several months ago, the first, um, uh, quantum readiness story from ServiceNow. And we're excited because it's grounded in something that is near term ServiceNow vault team in Q1 of next year post quantum cryptography PQC is classical based, but nevertheless it's a journey we have to start there. So I think how it shapes is forcing people to think about industries different. But also again elevating the governance piece what can we do to help people help companies, uh, safeguard data because right now there is the harvest, uh, harvest now decrypt later phenomenon that impacts all businesses. So what can we do to. Start thinking about that more rapidly and so I think moving from PQC and advancing it into ways that could become global standards, you know, I think that's where I, you know, us getting involved together in the public sector and as well in industry I just think it's an amazing opportunity to think about what. The the global world could look like in this new paradigm that I think is again looking at agentic AI is still very new and we need governance. I can't say that enough to all of you as you're building your solutions we need to figure out how to way to bring truth in because right now there's a lot of, a lot of hallucinations that need to be revisited too. So you know the the role of quantum would be something that we think as an accelerator to AI. I say all I had said earlier quantum plus AI because it is an accelerator. AI is great, but it could do better, and we think quantum is the could be a really good remedy for that. So how do we, how do we get our workforce ready for that combination for AI plus quantum? Well, first, I think enablement is key. I mean, I think, you know, in, in many businesses I think it's important to, to put together AI, AI enablement. But I think as we have in service now we actually are dedicating time for quantum enablement in 2026. I think it's important to do both, you know, not everyone's, uh, is a quantum, uh, physicist and or and or they're trained in classical AI and it's hard to bring those people out. But there's such an appetite we're finding internally for engineers that we have in AI to venture into the quantum side and so there are courses, certifications, things that we've even discussed, maybe even doing some certifications together, but this is a journey, this is not something that you're gonna, you're gonna do this by January 15th and you're gonna have the answer. It is a journey, but we feel very confident that it's the right path to go on. Um, if you could give one piece of advice to the builders in the audience, uh, how would they, would, how, how does, how can they start engaging with ServiceNow and AWS on co-innovation? Yeah, well, good, good question. So I'm part of the, the future team for Service now, um, and I think it's important to, you know, it has to be bidirectional. It can't be us coming always to you and saying, hey, we have a, we have a solution we wanna know what the problem is we want to hear from you to say this has been a pain point hearing from customers, so jointly hearing from customers to say how we might be able to help you is is definitely paramount. I think that we need to understand is what can we do from a pilot perspective, you know, you have to ask leadership, is it OK to have a window of time because I think we need time whether we dedicate 3 months to attacking a specific problem or a year in a research study. I think that's important again we need to ground it invalidity. So I think where we can start to to see this is pick up a phone and email and to you and me and see like where are you finding that there's an opportunity to leverage innovation. And I think we have we have innovation forums we invite people to EBCs where we focus on innovation workshops and kind of get to, you know, the, the crux of the problem. Sometimes people come in with one problem and they realize in the grand scheme of things it was very short term. So if we're we're talking about being in a world of horizons we need to start thinking about, you know, short, medium, and long term but Horizon 3 is not 5 years away anymore. The speed of innovation has happened so fast that we need to figure out a way to accelerate innovation so that patience is, is getting shorter and I think we have to deliver the results. So jointly, I, I just, um, one thing that you said earlier just to say about, um, you know, how back to the enablement. You need to get support from leadership. You need to have a cross org committee focused on innovation, focused on quantum plus AI focused on AI. I think, I think people realize a lot of people work on projects in silos, and I think that what the one of the beauties of how we can work together is help break the silos. So we do that first internally cross org and then cross company like we've been doing. I think it's been successful as we started exploring. Uh, possibilities with the role of quantum plus AI, we pushed each other behind closed doors, and I think that that's my ask of you. It's you need the cross team alignment because we often find that that's such a, such a hindrance for innovation and also the next earnings report shouldn't be the reason why you move innovation forward. We need to think more of more agility but also longevity. Mhm, thank you, um, we have a few minutes for some questions from the audience if anybody has a question for John. Anyone? I can't even see it's like yeah it's very bright, um, all right, well I, I'll ask you one, so one of the things that we've talked about in this whole quantum world is kind of like where to start, right? So I think a lot of organizations had that same thing with AI where do you start? And we, we have joint customers that are still trying to figure that out. So as organizations are looking at where to start with AI and starting their journey, how do they start looking at quantum and starting that journey? I think you have to see where you're already facing. Pain points in your business and seeing where you're already having difficulty with AI. Some of the more um complex computations will require an opportunity to look at quantum, but I think that having the ability to recognize what's already working and what's not is really important as as step one. I think, I think it's important to think about putting quantum to work. I think there was a slide earlier that Courtney had up of AI plus data plus workflows, and, uh, you have to understand that is there an opportunity for AI plus data plus quantum. AI workflows. So a lot of it is to test and try it, but I think you have to start by understanding what is your current environment and where are you seeing gaps. And like I said earlier, it won't. Quantum will not solve solve everything, but we are leading with AI and trying to fill gaps with Quantum, and that's the way I think you need to look into your own organization to fill the gaps. Hm, agreed. So at AWS we're seeing organizations, a lot of healthcare workers. Organizations using quantum, um, just because of the computational, you know, nature, how do you see, I know you talked about the workforce a little bit earlier today, but what types of people now do we need to employ to start thinking about the problems we don't even know we have yet? Look, I have an 8 year old son who's coding right now. I used to go outside and go play soccer. He's building Minecraft and all these things. The next generation is coming up very different than us. Uh, the kids today are already using AI in school. I think engine uh data science is really important. I think learning different playing around with different models is also very important. Chat GPT is not an AI strategy. And so I think what we need to use all the different availability uh of of models that are out there and I think exposing kids to this I think is really important. But as the kids become the next leaders we ourselves need to figure out what do we wanna do with this so I think you know there's a lot of academic institutions that offer free certifications around quantum computing. I think that's also very important um you and I've had the the opportunity to speak at at at a couple of academic institutions and there is a willingness to open up different uh paths with um. Like leveraging students in college and bring them into your company so I think there's that's a new avenue internships of course but I think that there's just an opportunity right now to look into math. Because you know this, there will be limitations you're talking about zeros and ones and you're talking about nature, so it's quite different. So I just think that we need, it's, I feel like people say you need to study this and just this, and I feel like you should study everything because you learn one model and next week a new one comes out. It's so hard. It's like, you know, Charlie Brown when he kicks the football and and loosely moves the goal posts. That's how AI is today. Like we're just getting, we're getting too comfortable putting one set of strategies in place. So I think with quantum 2, so with both parallel, I think it's an interesting dynamic to continue to learn, but also to, to test things and I think to that is, you know, engineering is, is gonna have a very bright future, you know, for decades to come. You touched on it just a second ago, but model choice, um, is confusing, fantastic, difficult to navigate, a lot of different things. What's ServiceNow's approach to model choice? So we're agnostic, um, and, and similar. Our approach to how so AI is very agnostic in that and I think that's one of the beauties of how we work together because quite honestly so are you but I think it's for us is to try to figure out the orchestration that's needed still in being agnostic but I think that there's. You know, the different, uh, models today have also governance issues like there's European models that have quite different information as they do here and if you actually solve try to solve a problem and you gave the same problem to 5 different models, you would be surprised at what you get back and how maybe how different the answers actually are. So don't take what the models give as face value and make a business decision on just what the model inputs, but I think that the one of the things that you can do is start benchmarking. And benchmarking the success and also benchmarking who's using what and I think that's one of the reasons why the AI control tower from ServiceNow is very valuable because it gives that window into who's using the models and what's the benefit of the models and you could start so I think parsing the data and it goes back to understanding the data but models are super super interesting certain models are good for certain things and I think that's one of the things the enablement piece has to help people understand is that good for you. And it might not be, which poses some very interesting questions when you look at an organization and how they're going to start implementing AI and who's in charge of choosing models. I don't know if you have looked into how that governance pieces it's a slightly different problem. I don't think that we, we haven't been told like do this, not that, um, I think there has been a definite gravitation towards, uh, trying new things and bringing them forward and if you have a case for trying something new that we don't have access to, I think it, it's something that that the executive team is very receptive to that. But I think, you know, make a business case for models I think is very important too. People use models and, and to your point earlier. They just assume it's the right model. Now we're talking about how we came together is the enterprise and the cloud enterprise models some models are better than others and some models you, you may just get the job done and I think some of that's trial and error. I mean, I, I was just saying this because I know one of my developers is in the audience right now. I mean, I use cloud and I've been using prototyping just as a tool for myself to prove ideas. It's quite valuable. It's quite interesting to see that. So it's nice that we actually now have Cloud inside ServiceNow. So I think sometimes when you make a case for certain models being beneficial, I think you'll have good access to them. I think the one of the things that AWS that we're trying to help guide customers on is how to budget around AI because it's a new territory um can you talk a little bit about when you're looking at sort of this overall, you know, overall AI strategy for an organization and looking at the work flows that would require the most attention first, um, and that's very subjective obviously how, how should organizations look at, you know, the right model versus cost versus governance? Yeah, I mean. Well, the cost is definitely gonna be high on the, on the equation, but as I said earlier, certain, certain models, um, are different for the enterprise than they are for, you know, normal, normal use. Nevertheless, I think how you're gonna do it is what's the tie the models to strategy. And I think that's another thing that's been missing too is people been using AI but actually not tying it to corporate strategy and I think as people start to bring AI and strategy closer together I think you're gonna find results and, and it's interesting because that surface now we have our CFO, uh, the corporate strategy team actually reports to her. So think about this for a second. So spending in AI. Financial results, strategic initiatives, they're tied together and I think you're gonna see more of that is and by that I mean bringing AI closer to strategy because I think that we need to start proving this because it shouldn't be a blank check and I think that's been the approach for the last two years is we had the open AI chat GPT moment and people just started writing a check just because they wanted AI in their brochure. But nevertheless I think putting it when we have tangible results that you can actually support customer um uh validations like we had DX DXE up here earlier. I think having customers actually saying that we've tried it and we worked and it worked, you'll get the bigger budget for AI but I think we need more proof and I think that's, that's gonna take time. But I like the notion of bringing AI and strategy closer together because. Ultimately I think the benefit um is is super high and I think that's one of the reasons why strategically we've come together because we know that there's a bigger story here but we've aligned strategy with the spending and I think that's that's uh maybe a lesson to to think about after this yeah we've seen uh a number of organizations uh report increased cost savings by using AI even though there is a different spend calculation that goes along with it. Um, and I would say, you know, at AWS, a number of the organizations that we've worked with first and foremost, sort of early on in all of this, um, tackled really big use cases early on, and I think we've talked a lot about don't do that, start smaller and kind of work your way up. What's your advice for organizations? I think you've heard me actually say this expression before, but if there's any baseball fans in, in, um, in the audience, if you hit a single every day, you get into the Hall of Fame. You do not need to hit a home run and I think that's been I think a misconception about how to use AI is you need to show grand results hit the base hit show the results, build upon those results, and I think you'll have a lot more of uh strategic outcomes that you can be proud of. In, uh, sort of last question for you, what's the downside to all of this? What, like, what advice would you give? Like what's, what's, what's to watch, uh, sorry, what to watch out for? I, I mean, I think I alluded to it earlier is I think sometimes we use these models and we take them as credible answers, credible advice, um, and I think that we still need the human in the loop and I think we need to, we need to model future work flows with more human involvement. And I think that that's something that is gonna take a lot of of rolling up our sleeves to figure out the place because it's not just it's not just how work is done today and earlier I mentioned like reimagining work and I think that's something that I would love to think about more um we bring out the best of each other because behind closed doors we're pushing the problem set and I think that's something that I think people should start to do is what is the compliance. What's the topic of this of this panel of governance like that's gonna be part of like what is going to be pulled through. So I mean I think you know if you can meet the upcoming regulations like don't look just past one quarter or 2nd quarter, there's a lot humming the fact that quantum is is is part of a conversation with AWS and Service now you can see that we're taking this super seriously. So I think as you're planning for what comes next, don't forget to where we are and responsible AI. Is built on trust and that's what the one of the the hallmarks of our relationship. Yeah, and I think getting people used to using it in the first place, right, too, trial and error, yeah, trial and error. John, thank you so much for your time today. Thank you all for joining us today. Thank you for being at AWS Reinvent. Hope you have a wonderful week.
