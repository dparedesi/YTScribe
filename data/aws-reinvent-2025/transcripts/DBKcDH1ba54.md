So welcome to this morning's session. Uh, we're gonna talk about NFor's journey and how they really transform how they do sec uh security operations within their company by leveraging AWS Security incident Response Service. Throughout this talk we're gonna go through and we're gonna give a little bit of a background on N4 and how N4 um utilize their business in order to uh take care of multiple industries that they have within their ecosystem. We're gonna talk through some of the challenges that N4 presented us with and some things that we had to think deeply about as far as how do we, how do we gonna solve those for them. We're gonna take you through the actual solution itself. And the journey that it took for us to be able to get there and then we're gonna wrap up with talking about some of the things that uh we did and you know as a result of learning about N4's journey, how that kinda help us shape the security incident response service. I'm gonna walk you through a demonstration of how one of the attack patterns that we're able to detect from from guard duty or one of your other detection, uh, tools and how we can use that to be able to triage, to be able to get to true intelligence for you. And then lastly we're gonna wrap up with some with some uh with some questions, uh, it's kinda like in a panel type of uh discussion and kinda talk about what's next, uh, for the service and what's next for security operations as a whole. So, so with me here, uh, two of my esteemed colleagues, um, so, so Mayona, she's the CISO for N4 and also Hart, uh, uh, security vice president here at AWS. Uh, they are quite more fashion forward than I am, so enjoy the, uh, the actual presentation, Mona. Hi, um, thank you, yeah, we are fashion forward we went shopping on Amazon same night, the same shirts. So what is M4 M4 is an industry specific AI driven cloud application and so what does that really mean? And what it really means is that we are built of several ERP systems that are specific to industries that deal with very complex operating environments. Let me give you an example. Ashton Martin, that is a cool product. And what N4 does, it allows Ashton Martin to actually specify what color thread it wants in the car and to have it in each car as it's manufactured so that's the unique requirements that our customers have is what specifically needs to be in each product and it builds out and lets them operate. What's really cool is that we have built our platform on AWS. We use hundreds of AWS services, of which lets us represent with our customers the business intelligence and the security that only N4 can offer. That's fantastic. Yeah, and so when I think about N4, N4 is involved in a multitude of different industries and so when they came to us and stated that given the, given the scope, given the fact that they are a platform that's not, you know, built and then shifted to AWS but they actually built into AWS we had to think deeply about how to solve some of their challenges. One of the things you think about is when we think about findings, when you think about some of your detection tooling. Um, oftentimes they are going to alert you on things that are maybe a, uh, low risk type of thing or it may be a critical type of finding, but oftentimes it's all mushed into one and so they, they came to us and said, hey, how do I get to the point where I can make real intelligent decisions based off the findings that I'm getting, whether that be from, uh, one of my detection tools within AWS Cloud or maybe it's from my EDR solution that I'm that I'm, uh, that I'm hosting here within my, my ecosystem. And so we had to solve for that particular that particular challenge. The second piece was when something does arrive, when something does alert me, how does my security team, my managed security service provider, and my vendor all work together in one particular environment so that way we can information share and we can work together to be able to get to the, to the actual root of the problem. And then lastly is, which is a challenge that most customers faced with is, well, how do I maintain the right level of expertise to be able to do incident response in the cloud environment? AWS has over 300 services, and so it's very challenging to hire uh security professionals that have that breadth of knowledge across all those particular services. And so we, we came up with a way to be able to do so. And so we're looking into those three buckets, we decided that we needed to get more proactive and not just think about the response element of security operations, but how do we get left a bang? And so we start looking at first how about we start ingesting all of your guard duty findings and all of your third party uh findings that can be integrated into security hub and Ford took it a step further and they, they partnered with us to be able to build connectors to bring in, uh, findings from their, uh, defender, uh, environment. They was able to bring in findings from CrowdStrike which currently, you know, at the time, uh, was not integrated into Security Hub. And so we were able to bring in those findings, be able to start enriching those, and then be able to get to a point where now we can triage. Now I understand your environment. Now I understand how you normally will operate. And so now we begin to triage those things to be able to reduce some of the noise. Yona explained about how large of an enterprise that they operate at. So we wasn't talking about 5 or 6 findings. We wasn't talking about 2 or 3 accounts. We were talking about a large estate of uh of real estate that one small security team could not be able to triage in a timely fashion, uh, the way that they wanted to. And so when we look at that, we decided that, well once we get to the point of ingestion, we can triage, we can be able to make, you know, intelligent decisions about what's important or not. Now we investigate the rest and so those investigations have gone down from the point of taking days to be able to get to an investigation or hours to now we can investigate within minutes. We were able to take in 4 from the point of having a finding be um maybe a, a day or so old to now that finding is actually raised within maybe minutes, if it's something that requires their attention. And then lastly is, well how do we escalate appropriately, right? How do we make sure that we notify the customer of an event that we can't make a determination on, and it's an event that we can't make the the determination that this is a false positive or it's a finding that's, that's not really important based on the, based on the activity that's taking place in the environment, and then we can escalate those urgently, uh, to them. So I mentioned that I was gonna walk you through an actual attack pattern that's that's very common uh amongst guard duty and and that's the DNA data uh exfiltration. Now there are multiple reasons why this finding may pop. Not all of those are uh malicious in nature. Some of those are dependent on what you're doing with the inside of your particular ecosystem. So N4 has, has guard duty enabled to have these findings that that comes in, and those findings will be able to be realized within AWS guard duty, right? Guard duty will take those findings, they present those to you in a dashboard form. You can have uh alerting mechanisms based off of those, uh, based off of whatever your, your settings happen to be. But then N4 onboarded to AWS Security incident response. So now we're taking those findings and we, we actually send those through uh an event bridge, uh, connection that actually allows those findings to come in to us, to our environment. And when it comes into us, now we have the, the triage, uh, responsibility aligned within AWS. And so we take those, we send those through a number of automations, uh, that allow us to be able to take in the guard duty finding, and then we're able to take a look at the EDR solution finding to be able to not just look at that finding in a vacuum, uh, by itself, but we'll be able to take a look at different telemetry from other areas of your ecosystem. To be able to let us know if that finding is actually a true uh positive or if it should be investigated or maybe it's a, it's a actual uh event that's taking place that we need to start doing incident response actions for. So because it's inside of the Security incident Response Service, now we're able to utilize the information that we have learned from the environment. We're able to triage. We're able to now use some of the respondent intelligent uh processes that's through a number of scripts to be able to see, maybe this is, maybe this alert triggered. Because of a pen test that's taking place. Maybe this alert triggered because there's a mergers and acquisitions process taking place. We get that information back from the customer and we're able to feed that into the logic to be able to make intelligent decisions off of it. When we get done with that, a responder, uh, an, an actual human is gonna look at these findings and determine if the logic could not make a determination on its own based on what we know about the customer's environment. If the human has to take a look at it now they have two decisions to make. One decision is, do I create a suppression logic where I can suppress that finding because I recognize what the customer is going through and4 has already outlined what's, what's taking place within their environment. They let us know on the 3rd Wednesday of every quarter they're gonna be conducting these particular actions, and we're able to use that to create the right suppression logic. But in the event that we can't at that point, then we escalate. To, to the customer, we escalate to N4. We let them know this right here is an event that we would like for you to validate. If this is expected behavior, if it is expected behavior, we go back to the previous step of creating the suppression logic. If not, then we kick off a security investigation. Now, although during this time period now we have reduced, um, we have reduced from let's say thousands of findings, now we're down to maybe 2 or 3 findings that we actually escalate to the customer. That's a lot more time for N4 to be able to focus in on the primary core parts of their business. We took this feedback, we've been able to enhance uh the service even further than what we had already provided. And so working with partners and customers like N4, we've been able to launch a number this past year we've launched a number of different enhancements and these 6 are just a few where we're now integrating uh agentic AI into incident response. This is automatically the moment N4 opens up a case with us now, there's gonna be an agent that's gonna run, that's gonna provide them with some key recommendations and some starting points in order where to look for. They're gonna include some, some log extractions to be able to highlight places for them to be able to start the investigation. All the while a security professional within AWS is actually gonna be checking into that case to be able to view those same results from the AI agent and to be able to talk back and forth together so the way we we we truly partner on the security operations journey for customers. Then we look at how we adjust it with with pricing. We recognize that the, the service needs to scale with the customer's business. And so we changed our approach from it being a uh a static entry point to now an immediate approach so that way as your business grows then your pricing uh will adjust with you. We look at the number of times that we communicate to the customer. There's a bunch of automation that takes place where the, where the service will communicate with you, but then there's also a number of times where you don't want necessarily that particular communication to come your direction. And so you're able to filter those things out. Certifications are important for a lot of our customers. Uh, N4 is, uh, included in that. And so we had to focus in on the most important certifications up front, which was high Trust, and then we continued to build up on that. So be on the lookout for additional, uh, launches of new certification that the service have been, uh, agreed upon. And then the ITSM integrations, big feedback that we got from Info and others about wanting to use your existing ITSM. And your ticket management systems to be able to integrate into the security incident response service. And then lastly is being able to not just have to onboard an entire OU an entire organization, but now we allow you to onboard at the OU level, uh, within that particular service. So we've taken all this feedback, we've integrated all these enhancements, and we got the results back from from N4. So we started off with this journey with N4 having this large estate of AWS accounts. And of course with an estate that large, you have a lot of endpoints, you have a lot of systems, you have a lot of applications that's involved within your environment. We're able to take all those in, triage those particular findings, and then be able to see some real gains from that. So when you think about a typical security operations team who are going through manually investigating each one of their findings that that come up, we're able to save a lot of time in their in their uh in their cycles and so now her team is able to really respond to and actually focus in on harder problems that humans should be should be dealing with today because the automation, the technology is doing a lot of that triage and a lot of that tier one work for them on their behalf. And so even when we get down to the, the number of cases that that 1% um that was uh investigated and that 0.03 that was actually escalated. They were all expected patterns of behavior. Uh, these were pin tests that was taking place. These were activities and game days that the customer, uh, were doing that we didn't have any knowledge of, but we were able to find this pattern, find this activity, and escalate to them, uh, in a timely fashion. And so that I think in its own was a huge win for for you and your team and to be able to allow your team to get back some of those hours in the day, uh, to be able to focus in on harder problems. One of the last things that I do wanna discuss is, uh, I do wanna talk about the security incident response uh AI agent. There have been a lot of energy, a lot of uh excitement about agentic AI in a lot of places. One of the places that we felt super deeply about was how do we do this in a security incident response environment. Like what does AI agents look like in IR? If you think about, you know, most threat actors and most um and most actors, they have always tried to use what used to be used as admin tools against the actual uh organization. And so what we figured was we can use an AI agent to help us with this particular problem. And so as we think about attack patterns being, being more sophisticated, as we think about the speed at which attacks are going forth these days, uh, we're really at a point now where Azita AI is the only way for us to keep up with this particular pattern. And so we've incorporated that deeply today. You can go into security incident response console, open up a case with AWS, and based off of the, the information that you provided in that particular case, the AI agent will start running on your behalf immediately and start going through your cloud trail. It will begin to start looking at, uh, areas within your environment that's uh that's aligned that particular attack pattern. And even if it find things that are maybe that you didn't call out, uh, it would tell you, hey, this right here is also something that I've seen that could be a, uh, an area of concern that you might wanna take a look at and provide you with recommendations, uh, on that. And so we're super excited about security response that the, the AI agent. Uh, it is not something that has to be, uh, enabled. It comes by, by default, uh, to customs when they, when they're in there. And so we've been able to utilize that here today, uh, with 4, on a couple of their cases, and we've really got some interesting results, uh, back from, from those that we, that were, that really opened our eyes up on some things that, that, uh, some points that we could start with our investigations. So, uh, really would like to go in and kind of talk through, uh, recent. Recent journey with with with N4, maybe a couple of weeks ago we had an opportunity to work closely together, uh, just to really understand how we, how we think about, uh, pin testing in our environments and how we think about when we're doing testing in game days and we're running through challenging our security teams to, to kind of exercise their, their response capability. You wanna talk about that a little bit? Sure, so, um. Couple of things when you look at the metrics of what we've done first of all. Before we got the results I had anxiety and that was because I was like I don't know what the results are going to share and um so one of the gentlemen that reports to me he called and told me uh he he sent me a message on that Saturday and I was like, are we OK? Are we OK? And we were OK so um I always remember that in that special call that we were OK but the thing is we did find some things and what we found were actually results. That had generated from pen testers so we do a lot of pen testing because of all our products we have 200 products in our um multi um tenant environment we have regulatory requirements for pen testing and so we do actually allow for pen testing and with that. I was so proud that uh you're the technology found it um likewise we had another um pin testing type of situation which we saw and and I you know instantly um initiated the process which was great for letting us test the environment and it was within seconds that AWS was able to just totally look at everything and let us know we're comfortable and what it was and so really appreciate the speed of execution and. I just have to go back to when we started I think like to me what I saw we flipped a switch and it was on. I'm sure there was more than that in the background but it did enable us to actually scale across a very large environment and so we're 77% overseas and with that we work with many different companies that have strong name recognition overseas about what we provide and to be able to. Know within a moment that we're OK is great and then this um the investigation tool that's really exciting. I hope I'm I'm gonna have to trust you that I will never have to read or write another playbook as long as I live. That's fair that's fair that's fair. Yeah, so, so one of the things that Debbie Jones is talking about is the moment that you enable the service we begin triaging your findings right away and so when they, you know, uh, virtually flipped the switch to turn on, uh, her, uh, her concern levels was very up to find out what was gonna be found. There have been times, uh, where we have worked with customers, we have been inside, we have been brought in to particular cases to. Uh, for one issue, and we've noticed that there has actually been activity in this environment for months, um, and, and by months I mean multiple months, of, of time, and so you don't know sometimes what you don't know, and, and 4 had a very, a very clean, uh, environment, but, uh, you never know until somebody looks underneath your hood kind of what the what the, what your carburetor really looks like, right? And maybe carburetor's too much of a I heard I heard about it and there had been 6 months in the environment and I was like, oh no, that can't be us. It wasn't. It was not, no it was not. Yeah. Yeah. So, so how, how are you how are you thinking about this from a from a uh from a senior level? Yeah, you know, there's a few things going on here. First of all, super excited to have the one year anniversary of the service. Had early adopters like Minana and N4 and many others. Um, one of the things that I love that's played out, and we haven't emphasized it a lot yet, but maybe we can now is. This idea that it's a team sport, it's not just AWS and N4 in this case, but you know we've got CrowdStrike, we've got other partners right who are deeply embedded with the customer, providing MDR, providing instant response and other things, and you know, uh. It's really incumbent upon us as defenders to make sure that the adversary doesn't have any unnatural advantage, and one of the best ways we do that is by bringing the best and the brightest together, right? And to provide that active defense. And so I know Mignano, when we were first talking to you, you know, having the ability to work with your existing partners was so critical. Can you tell us a little bit about that? Yeah, um, so we. Because we're everywhere, um, we have a lot of partners and with that it's not only just what we see in AWS but it's also with CrowdStrike and Defender we run both of them and then we have a lot of other add-on tools that we run just to um the you know layered defense type of process but to me if I just look at it we've got the powerhouse of what you see what AWS sees which. I asked you a while ago how much of the Internet do you cover. Uh, in 2019 it was one third, and I don't know if you have an up to-date number on that, but so AWS is out there pretty much hitting a large part of the Internet, so you're going to see things, and then CrowdStrike's going to see data from a different lens, and then Defender's going to see it from a different lens, and you take all that and you glue it together. It helps you have comfort in what you see to know that it's really valid. Absolutely. And, and then the other thing I like particularly about our relationship is that you've been very active in paying that forward to your customers and your partners, right? And so you've been able to explain that sort of value proposition that working with in for on top of AWS with this whole security ecosystem at your disposal really is a benefit to your customers and partners. Yeah, so if you think about the, the standard ERP customer, and I'm gonna go back, so my entire career you're, when you, when you join a company, you get put on an ERP roll out assignment. And usually the people who are running the assignments are not your security people, it's more project managers, business operations, and. Then there's the CFO who pays the check and so you have to talk and communicate the value of what you're doing to these audiences and then it goes to the board because they're paying the check so this gives us a chance now to share with them a really scalable solution or our partners so when they talk to their customers or when they have the interactions to sell, they're not selling to security people but they're selling to audiences that want. To know that we're secure because they read what's in the media and that's the lens of what they've got from security what is in the news or what an auditor has shared or what is a regulatory requirement, so we give them the information that they need to know for three pillars, but more importantly is what is in the news and that's where the frantic happens can this happen to us? And so when the can this happen to us comes about. We now say we've got. This, you know, I call them the powerhouses and CrowdStrike, AWS, Defender. You've got these large companies that are watching everything that's happening and they're responding instantaneously when something happens and we've got all of that looking at our environment. I mean, I, I, I had to just go to my standard language. How cool is that? Absolutely, and it's super fun to be part of that journey with you and your customers and your partners. The other thing I'm super excited about, uh, Lindsay, as you mentioned, is the agentic workflows that we're exposing to customers now. I know you talked through in depth. Um, it's the tip of the iceberg, right? And one of the things we're seeing very early on is that, you know, the more we can do to reduce undifferentiated heavy lifting, the more we can do to speed up an investigation. Right, and reduce the time to value or security value there, the better off we are for everybody, right? To go from a bump in the night to everything was all right as quickly as possible is really the name of the game. And, and, uh, agentic AI generative AI is an absolute game changer for us, absolute game changer, and, and we've, we're seeing it in multiple different aspects. We, we use it internal, uh, as well. We just have now been able to, uh, expose it, uh, to customers, but, but we try to start with AI. Uh, in-house and, and how can we do that where we're not, um, putting more pressure on the cognitive load of the incident responders and how do we relieve, how do we alleviate some of that, right? So our res you know, our response teams, our engineering teams, our product teams, like they all work together, um, in order to be able to produce the best possible product, and we try to do that first using AI, um, I, I, I try to use AI at least once a day. Uh, now because I've seen so much, uh, benefits, uh, from it, and, and I'm coming from, uh, being a traditional, uh, security person. Start off being a traditional, uh, you know, IT administrator, right, where I felt like I had to do everything myself and now because of AI, like the, the API calls, the, the way it's able to integrate, especially with a lot of our authentication systems to be able to develop, uh, some of these, uh, nice enhancements for to to enable us to conduct incident response a lot faster. Um, it is an absolute game changer the way we're able to incorporate AI now into security operations. Absolutely, just maybe to add a little bit of that, one of the things that I've been, uh. Really impressed with is the way that our threat research folks have embraced uh agentic AIs right? So using Quiro I've watched that team, you know, go from an old model of maybe whiteboarding something, looking at some data, getting, you know, kind of a war room collaboration mentality together to now, you know, getting a data point, going right into Quiro and using a natural language prompt to. You know, really spec out what it might look like to create a detector, to create a mitigation strategy, right, and then either use that to feed into the service teams to go do the work or actually go right from the spec in Quiro into proof of concept code. And so again, like reducing the undifferentiated heavy lifting, increasing collaboration, speed to to resolution is kind of unheard of. Right? And, and it was a quick changeover, right? It's not like they spent, you know, weeks and months trying to learn the technology. It's like literally within an hour or two, like they went from, hey, I've got this idea. Let me try doing a natural language prompt. Oh my goodness, it actually worked. OK, let me look at the spec. OK, now let me decide the next action. It's just mind bogglingly cool. You, you, you bring up Quiro. Quiro is very interesting. Um, I, I used Quiro last week before I came to, to reinvent. Uh, I, I had a, I had a, uh, I had an indication. Uh, uh, IOC that I had from, from one customer. And I was interested to see if some if another responder had identified a similar IOC and so I threw it into Kira and told her to, to look at my resolver group, to look at my, my particular ticket NQ and look for this IOC anywhere else in the environment. And it gave me back a summarization of the number of times that this IOC have been seen and what that IOC could have been doing and throughout the environment, it gave me a full write up, uh, on it. And I was able to use that, talk to my team, and, and they thought I was a genius at first so I told them it was Kiro, um, but it really allowed us to move faster to be able to make a decision on how we wanted to address that particular IOC. So instead of looking at it in the vacuum, we were able to actually put a, uh, a block in place widespread. So the way that we can prevent that action going forward and working with the service teams working with our threat intelligence groups, uh, to be able to get that information out to the public, uh, faster let me ask you a question since I'm absorbing this right now. So if we have a finding, can we use Kiro against that finding to um see if it's somewhere else as well, or? In your, depending on how you have your MCPs. So, so we have, we have MCP servers that are, that are set up that I built specifically looking at my ticket queue. So you can create a MCP server internal to have it start scurfing through the rest of your, uh, your environment that maybe that's not covered by us because we're gonna do it for you on your behalf for, for those that, that are, uh, I'm all about copying what you do. You, you are. So, so we're gonna do that on your behalf, but if you would like to do a subcord, you absolutely can. It just sounds intriguing to me, yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. So speaking of questions, Muana, I prepared a few ahead of time, and I hope it's OK with you and Lindsay if I ask you a couple of them, um, so the first question is, um. I wanna go back to this idea of a team sport and so for you and Lindsay, you know, how are these multifaceted security partnerships preparing you for opportunities maybe as far out as 2030? How are investing in those relationships now, you think gonna pay off in the future? Yeah, I, I can start us off. I, I, for, for me, uh, the way we think about our partnerships is we look at it as um. Threat actors work together, right? Like you, you, you've seen in a number of public cases where you have a threat actor get into an environment they actually bought the credentials from another threat actor, and then there's another threat actor that's handling the payment processing systems, right? And so we got this notion that we can't do security uh by ourselves and so we bring in partners, we bring in other solutions, and we have regular interactions with one another um in order to test out these uh these flywheels, right? So how do I feed information to a partner? How do I receive information from a partner and then how do we work together? And so when we think about 2030, right, like we, we can't do security the same way that we're doing it today. And so we're always leveraging what is the next ridge line that that we have to cross, right? What happens if we had a situation where we had to do incident response across 20,000 accounts? Right? How do we do that at scale? And how do we do that at at a tempo that can still be at the right pace that we don't cause any harm to the actual customers or to other businesses. And so what we've been looking at is, you know, security used to be a back office function. Uh, security now is a core process within most businesses where we have to have a seat at the table to understand where the business is going. And so as businesses are starting to go, go towards open search, uh, using open source technology. As businesses are looking to leverage more, more bedrock and other, uh, services, we can't be behind in finding out how to secure these particular products and so for us I would say that that what we're looking at, we're looking to integrate more within the businesses within that particular areas like you know, marketing, whether that be, uh, product teams, so the way that we can move with the business instead of being blockers, being perceived as being blockers or being late to the to the party as it relates to the, the new technology. So, um, I wanna pick up on a phrase I just heard this morning about we're no longer about the badges we wear. And so we become one team and I was listening to what she was thinking and what you know my I give thoughts about 20-30 that's coming up pretty quick and I think about what's happened over the past 30 years I've been doing this and I'm doing some of the things, same things I've been doing over the past 30 years and I'd love to see that go away and I really see what some of the stuff you're doing with Amazon Que and others like we'll um hopefully. And you say you nod your head yes, definitely we won't have to use the word scanning anymore or password management so we remove the processes of what we traditionally know security to be and to your point about working closer with the business, then we can enable security from a different lens on how we operate in a company to help it make more money, become more efficient, but do it in a secured way because the security then becomes codified and so, um. It's removing all the mundane task. So like if you think about scanning and vulnerability management, it's kinda like writing lines in elementary school. I will not sleep in class. I will not sleep in class. I will not sleep in class. Our life has become that with some of the processes that we have to do. So I see us overcoming all of that, overcoming all the metrics and all the data collection instead, enabling growth. Yeah, yeah, it's fantastic. That's super awesome. Also, you know, as we're talking about it. I think of your point about uh Amazon, you know, supporting a large swath of the Internet and it's a responsibility we take very seriously and we've got a lot of focus on how to stay resilient, how to stay secure, how to stay safe, um, it's not just the terrestrial Internet anymore, right? And so now we're talking about space, the very real possibility of interplanetary communications, right, in our lifetime. And so thinking about the ability to do that as well, right, when you think about disconnected or 4 deployed systems like an oil well or a tanker, that is very hard to reach. But once you've got a satellite up in the sky, it, it's impossible to kind of recall it for a patch or to investigate an adversary that might. poking around inside it and so you know taking services like the security instant response service, the relationships we're investing in today with customers and partners like yourself, CrowdStrike, Palo Alto, and others and thinking about, you know, how do we ensure that we can provide the safest computing environment for our customers, no matter how far out they wanna go, right, to space and beyond is, is really a top priority when you think about what we need to be investing in today. To realize that in 2027 or 2030, right, which as you point out, it's not too far away. Like 4 years. Yeah, it's pretty close. It's pretty close. You need to give us a stretch goal. I need to give a stretch. So another question I was kind of curious about, um, both of you are, are big tenured leaders in the security space. What are you doing to invest in the security culture that allows your responders and engineers to innovate fearlessly? So, um, security culture is a, is a big thing for us and it's not just within our company, it's actually working with you guys and working with our customers as well. It's a couple of things that we've done. We, um, we've actually built what's called a security board. It has 9 senior leaders that represent the development community of our organization and so what we're doing is starting to unify the knowledge sharing across the developers because you've learned the magic of when if you go. As a security practitioner and we've done this in the past and we know the answers to all the questions and we go in and say you can and cannot do this, but instead you leverage those who create the technology and the thoughts and processes of what they have the magic starts evolving in a different way because they don't have the um legacy thought processes in place so we've done that security board working with the product groups and then we built also what's called a security exchange and so the security exchange is we bring in different. People within the company, you don't have to be a security person, but someone has an interest in contributing and the objective is kinda like at AWS when you had a, a a Slack channel where you exchange ideas and you exchange ideas, but when a, a threat comes up, you show it, everyone goes and checks their environment out. But also if you have a question about how to do something, you go to, you go and ask the question or you wanna ideate on a way to look forward and so by embracing and bringing others into. The content you see a richness that comes out because there we're no longer just the security group. The security is the organization and I think the last thing is our marketing team and communications team who's present today with us have put security in almost everything that they talk about and so I wanna embrace you know the word security security security because it is on top of every company's mind and so we are using it to the marketing advantage letting companies know that we're doing it so. Our culture is us and how we operate, operating with you guys and then operating with our customers, and we do have 90,000 customers worldwide. That's awesome. That's awesome, yeah, I, I, I, I think about security similar to you, Miyona. I, I think about everyone being involved in security. So when we think about. Um, service teams, when we think about product teams, when we think about, uh, folks that work in business intelligence, like that's a security component to everyone's business, right? Uh, we need our customers, we need our employees, we need our users, uh, to have a security mindset. Uh, because that is sometimes one of the easiest entry points into, uh, a cus someone's ecosystem is by sending out the phishing email, you know, sending out the, the like the spear fishing, uh, campaign, doing the social engineering, uh, activities. I know that sometimes these sound like legacy, uh, activities, but these are very effective, uh, techniques and strategies that, that, um, that's being used and deployed. And so we think about that deeply and so everyone um has to have a security focused mindset and so we took it a step further we have security champions we have um one of our uh colleagues uh created a uh scouts program of professionals who are really champions uh behind security uh within the organization so sometimes these are here are people who look around corners in a different way that maybe the security team don't necessarily see. But they're embedded within other lines of business throughout the company and so we've seen a lot of value from that because when they are champions, when they are part of the scouts program, they have a different lens that they're looking at and they're able to tap their, their, their colleagues and say, hey, like, you know, you, you don't have the right alt attached to that, right? Or you don't have any alt, uh, attached to that, hey, we, we need, we need to fix that, right? Or hey, how about we not deploy that code until we get application security review on it. And so we've seen that be uh really transformed when we think about the culture of security and and lastly is um we really love escalating. Um, I, I, I can't speak without saying the word escalate at least, uh, 2 or 3 times throughout a particular point, but it's truly built into the fabric and built into the DNA that there's no hesitation, there's no fear in escalating. I think the, the best thing about it is whenever we have the opportunity to escalate, uh, one of the first responses that I hear from leaders is thank you. You know, thank you for, for bringing me in. Thank you for, for urgently, uh, bringing this to my attention. And then the next question is, well, what, what can I do? How can I help, right? Like they, they want an action to do to be able to help out with that particular, uh, use case. And and for me that, that's pretty, uh, enriching and I think that's a great way to have a good culture. Uh, you know, a, a, a wise man once said, don't hesitate to escalate. Uh, that wise man might be on stage with us today actually. Uh, and, and right up there, right, is we've got other great things that, that kick around the company, uh, we've got one, character on the team, Paco, who has this idea that security exceptions require exceptional security, right? And so if we're gonna do hard things, it's an opportunity to raise the bar for the way we do security around them, right? And, and all of that for me, you know, listening to some of your wise words, Lindsay and others is this idea that to have a strong security culture you have to. Groom it. You have to garden it, right? And you've gotta be a student of the culture to learn about the way things are working today and how they're working and why. And, and if you're gonna have strong security culture, you've gotta understand the, the corporate culture itself and how they dovetail in. Then you've gotta be a student of the culture. You've gotta be an advocate, right? You've gotta be a thought leader, right, as, as Minana and, and Lindsay have sort of chatted about today. And then you've got to put on your builder hat and say, you know, the security culture today may not be the security culture of tomorrow and what can I do regardless of where I am in the organization to build that right culture, to build that right mental model so that others can innovate and achieve what maybe they didn't think was possible and Minati, you mentioned that directly. It's like, like, you know, let's stop focusing on necessarily some of the guardrails and let's focus on the opportunities that present themselves, right? And so having that kind of student steward builder mindset as we're talking about security culture I think it's just um. So powerful, right, and you don't have to be the CISO to be able to do that, right? Anybody can build security culture, right, from anywhere in the org and, and for me that's like what I wanna see more of in the future for all of our customers and partners. 100%. Sure, so, um, I, I guess in that same vein. How do you see your security strategies today? Allowing you to more comfortably adopt. Agentic AI and generative AI in the core business. So not necessarily security applications, but by doing some of the things we're talking about in security from your strategic standpoint, how are you unlocking opportunities for the business to go do interesting things with the gente and Gen AI? So, uh, we're unlocking it for our customers as well. So it's in our platform we have, um, what's called Velocity Suite and a set of modules that you get with our product that actually shows how to do process mining. Are other things that help companies operate more efficiently and make more money and create their competitive advantage on growing so in our company what we're doing is we're taking the same training our developers are taking and all the others because we wanna think like our customers think and so we're looking at it on how we can actually enable growth and efficiency and um I you know efficiency I cannot get past that because there's so much stuff that we just waste time on every day. And this is going to help us just get off to where we are not thinking about that and then we get to another realm of creative thinking and start using our critical judgment and we get back to where we were, you know, when we're in our youth about, you know, thinking about how to do things and then growth is going to just expand on ideas. Yeah, 11 of the ways I think about that is, uh, it's a little bit different because I'm not thinking about it from a financial standpoint. I'm wondering about it from, uh, a time perspective, right? Like, you know, you mentioned about like not doing some of those smaller tasks, and I think back on when we try to create, and we're, we're a very data rich, uh, organization, right? And so the amount of data that we have, uh, to kind of get through, to try to make sense of based off of the, the conversation that we're having and based on what we need. I I think one of the ways we can do that is, is by being more transparent, uh, really in the, the use of AI and, and responsible use of AI and so when we think about that, we think about it from the standpoint of, well, we have the technology that's been authorized, right? We, we, we've gone through the right security controls to make sure that, uh, that the right information can be presented to the right authorized user. You know, it's being transparent when we use those things and so I think about when we go through our business reviews, you know, there are times where I will, you know, tell that, hey, this, this particular, um, presentation that you're seeing right now was actually created by Kiiro or I have the right attachments, you know, built in within my web browser that if I'm on a particular web page, I can ask questions to Amazon Q in real time, uh, to be able to give me information that I need that maybe the the page is too rich, maybe it's, it's too much information. And I need to quickly get to a decision, um, and I'll be able to ask Amazon Q right there on the, on the spot. And so when I think about those type of, uh, APIs and I think about the integration, uh, with a lot of our AI tooling, I think that's the best way to get more usage and more adoption, I think throughout the throughout the company and the organization, um, it's been truly phenomenal. Awesome, awesome. So we're running up against time here, uh, last question. Simple one. Future of security incident response, right? You just a simple question, simple question. So just, just a couple of thoughts on where, where that space is going. OK, I got it so I think that um. I foresee incident response being a uh a a race against time. I foresee um more threat actors. Deploying, they're already deploying scripts, right? A lot of, a lot of threat actors are using scripts as, as they're, if they uses. Matter of fact, it might be a threat actor or two out here too. So, so, uh, it, so threat actors use scripts, um, in order to form some of the attacks. But I foresee that threat actors are gonna start using, um, some of these AI models to continuously run some of these attacks, and not just, not just in the DDoS type of perspective, right, where attacks are gonna be able to. Adjust to your defense mechanisms. So if you think about how we do security operations and defense in a traditional environment, those would not be effective against uh an AI attack. We're gonna need AI to defend against a AI particular attack and so I see that uh threat actors will be more shape shifting where they're gonna be looking for uh other pivot points in in real time and and not a human. I'm talking about the AI agent. Where they're gonna continuously, as you begin to start blocking some of these protocols, you begin to start blocking points and things of that nature, they're gonna really continue to transform and continue to uh adjust to the defensive, uh, posture, right? We've been talking a lot about, about, um, about supply chain, uh, attacks of that nature, right? Like we gotta get into the point of like supply chain defense where we are constantly meeting the, the, the demands of the future. Using AI and leveraging that uh within our environments and ecosystem, yeah, so, um, I just kind of envision we really don't need a sock anymore in the future, um, to that, yeah, and I keep asking the question like why don't we use the same ticketing system that our IT team uses or our developers use because if you look at a company, each group has their own ticketing system, each group has their own way to handle. Um, like we just call it problem tracking, troubleshooting, whatever. Instead it should just morph into one thing. If you have something that happens that's not normal, then there's a process that's automated to address it. So how do we get to that process to automate to address it? And then that's where the thought processes come in, because when it's not normal, that means it's going through all the AI analysis and it means that something really weird is happening. And I, I think the most awakening process was I was listening to how Amazon handles incident response, so you don't have an L1 and L2 anymore because if something abnormal happens or something strange or different or whatever, a ticket's automatically generated to the owner of that transaction and that person then researches it and then only the L3 type of activity comes to the person and so, or the responder or whatever you wanna call it now I see that L3 activity going to a support team. And how do we start then scaling down the support team because again there's a lot of synergy in these processes and we talked about it in the data center days of fusion centers you have security monitoring you have, um, your data center monitoring you've got all these different monitor your physical security group monitoring bringing it all into one screen that you look at. So you know, let's that be our next step. Plus one and then I'll just toss a small idea out there. One of the trends I see kind of emerging is hyper specialization or personalization. And so today you might have a centralized, uh, investigative. You know, chatbot or AI that all the responders are working with in the future I think one very real possibility is they'll each have their own individualized bot that's trained on their research methodology, their case data, their courses of action, right, uh, maybe some of their public speaking so it has a little bit of an understanding of their philosophy or approach and so. They can get much faster outcomes in the style and manner in which they have expertise, right? We're already seeing that today, uh, a lot of public speakers have basically a speaker bot where it has, you know, all their YouTube, all their scripts, everything, and now for the new topic you say, you know, write me a speech. You know, like this other one I did, but on this new topic, and it, you know, kind of generates it for him, and so I see the same thing happen for responders, a lot of hyperspecialization, a lot of personalization. Yeah, that's fantastic. I, I cannot, uh, I cannot think about that from a, a bot of bots. You could have, uh, you could have a really an agent of ages, I think is what we, what we, what we talked about, and that's similar to what we're talking about that's, that's, uh, really fantastic. But could I have a holographic figure deliver the speech for me then? That'd be even better, right? Well, the, the holographic image would not be so fashion forward as, as you are right now, meona, so I think that would be one of our robot then, yeah. Yeah, so one of the things that we do wanna offer is uh ability for, for everyone who wants to, uh, continue on their, uh, cloud journey. Um, if you want to, uh, elevate kind of your knowledge and, you know, take a couple of courses within, uh, ADS SkillBuilder. Um, you can get access to the security identity and compliance area to, to learn more about, uh, security operations and how to do that within the cloud. Uh, I do wanna take the moment though, and thank you, uh, Emiyonaote, for your, for your time, for, uh, your attendance here on stage, sir. Um, you know, I appreciate you and, and the valuable questions that you asked. Those were hard. Uh, you said like the easy questions that was gonna be asked, but, uh, but thank you for, for your insight and thought leadership. Um, if you do have any questions, uh, for us because it's a silent session, we can't do a, uh, a live Q&A. Uh, but please catch us, uh, outside the, the doors of this, uh, particular room and be able to answer any questions that you all may have. With that being said, thank you all for your time. Cool, thank you, Lindsay. Thank you, Manyana.
