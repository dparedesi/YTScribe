Hello, good evening to the silent Room. My name is Runo Vacatelo. I'm financial services partner for IBM Consulting in Chile. And here with me. Soledad Bando Soledad Bado is the general manager for commercial lending. At Bangusta. So to start. Over the past few years we have all been talking about. Artificial intelligence and how it has moved to the center of the conversation in banking. It's no longer just a concept. It's been applying across different areas in banking risk compliance, customer engagement. Everywhere in banking it is. In particular this year. Where the adoption accelerated significantly. So that means that artificial intelligence is a fundamental part of the transformational plans for banking. So far Many of the use cases we are seeing right now are mostly applied to. Producing efficiencies and incremental improvements. According to a recent study from the IBM Institute for Business Value, 1 25% of the organizations. Are not using artificial intelligence at the middle of their intelligent workflows that means that they are avoiding using artificial intelligence for growth for changing their current business models. As you can imagine this is a huge opportunity ahead. And Continue with this study. We are forecasting that for the end of 2026. Intelligence war flows will will multiply by 12 in banking that would be that that's huge. That would be a complete. Shift in how the work it's being performed in banks and how it will change the customer interactions of customers with the banks. This kind of innovation. That is, that is particularly important in banking. Uh, is regarding or it can leverage the richness of the data the bank manages and as we take a, take, take, take uh advance of the complexity of the current processes that the bankings are now performing. So this kind of innovations is part of the soul of Banco Estado and you know it's also part of the story of collaboration we IBM and AWS always try to have with the gang. So Let me just Give you a a a very brief story of the past. 60 years ago Chile was facing, uh, was undergoing a very important uh uh technological change. By the end of 1969, IBM and Banquestado defined and deployed the first teleprocessing network in Chile. That network allowed branches to perform transactions in real time. That my friends Was the beginning of the innovation and the modernization process for the Chilean industry in banking. Now Banquestado processes more than 1 million transactions per month on IBM technology. You know this, this history, this epic is what we wanted to repeat. Last year, so by the end of 2024, we agreed a new strategic alliance with Bancostado. Aiming to fulfill the current Chilean needs and. Being according to the current technological possibilities that we have nowadays. And we set a particular goal. Our goal is to. To make technology and make innovations available for helping the way the Chilean client lives in Chile. So Before going further, I would like Soledad to Talk about what Ban Gustavo is doing right now. OK, thank you, Bruno. Um, good afternoon everyone. Uh, I'd like to begin, uh, by thanking Amazon WhatsApp, uh, for inviting me to be a part, uh, of this event and especially IBM, uh, for inviting me to talk about the work we do at Bancostado in Chile and our partnership for the development of one of our recent innovation and apologize for my limited English. Uh, which I, uh, why I will be giving my speech, uh, my presentation in Spanish, um, Isabel, help me, yes, OK.

Banquestada is a 160 year old bank controlled by the Chilean government. Its social mission is bringing technology innovation to customers and companies in Chile. Its key role in promoting financial inclusion in Chile, including universal debit card, banking correspondence, and microfinance programs. Among the 20 million people population in Chile, 17.5% of the 17.5% million hold one or more Bancostao products. Bancostado app is the number one. In downloads in Chile, holding 12 million active users and 50% out of them use the bank the bank on a daily basis, Banquestado has 1.2 million commercial clients that account for more than 90% of the total employers in Chile. It makes it the leading mortgage credit company in Chile.

Over the last years, innovation has become a strategic pilot to accelerate Bancostao's business by pushing the ecosystem model to raising the bar for its services and expanding its role beyond daily banking. Three strategic initiatives are built around this, um, this priority. Number 1 is digital customer experience both for, um, helping educate non-tech savvy customers and to existing to the new generation. Next one is the development acceleration of a finance ecosystem managing the relationship between large enterprises, its providers, SNB and end customers, and finally to accelerate the sustainable development of the country. Some of the examples in the strategic initiatives include RootPay, which will be the first super app in Chile. Um, startup financing program which in 2 years has granted 100 companies plus $20 million in investments. Impact Plus that articulates the relationship between companies and Green Impact for sustainability.

It started with the strategic analysis that led into accelerating a housing construction ecosystem. The decision for deciding if, how to, when and why to invest on housing. Number one was that Banquistado is the leader in mortgage loans in Chile. It has a, a large percentage of investments in financing, construction, and other housing initiatives, and Bangustado holds a close relationship with the government and large companies in the industry that helps accelerate the connection between doctors and the ecosystem.

The housing ecosystem joins uh banking with companies and clients and changes the experience in in purchasing real estate in Chile, converging this and helping Bancostado become one bank. This is a unique opportunity among all banks in Chile. There's no other. Platform as this one, it merges IBM Consulting deep expertise in financial services and AWS state of the art technology to benefit clients in Chile. Thanks Soledad. thanks Isabel, and let me, let me show you a very, very short video. To understand what this means. Throughout its 170 years, Banco Estado has continuously evolved to improve its services. Serving its 15 million customers and acting as an economic stabilizer. Manual and complicated processes, the disarticulation between the actors in the sector and limited access to financing prevent many Chileans from achieving the dream of owning their home. Banco Estao has a solution. A digital platform that allows you to search for the best housing option at any time, supports savings and provides financial education and makes it easier to obtain a mortgage online within its marketplace. Customers can apply for loans online with the support of an artificial intelligence-based assistant that helps them throughout the process. The platform is also designed for companies in the sector, integrating the government, real estate companies, construction companies, notaries and product and services providers, creating a unified experience from obtaining construction permits to housing administration. Risk models based on machine learning allow Banco Estao to provide access to housing to more Chileans who are currently rejected by traditional models, positioning itself as a bank for all and inviting them to join in the development of an ecosystem that supports growth, innovation and prosperity. Together, Banco Estado and IBM create a better future for housing and construction in Chile. Throughout its 100 Well, Thank you Soledad. Let's look how the collaboration is being put into practice. So to address the different needs for the construction and housing. Uh, players in this ecosystem, we decided to build a new business model and also a new operational technological platform that will be shared by all the partners in this ecosystem so all participants banks, the notaries, legal entities, and other providers will access. To this platform will and they will be connected by intelligent workflows using artificial intelligence. This approach promotes collaboration, transparency, and efficiency for the entire ecosystem. And the impact becomes even clearer when we look the client's perspective so. What are, what are we? Trying to deploy to the market. For the next couple of weeks. A real change. In the customer experience. At the beginning, clients will apply. For a new mortgage we will apply for we'll try to search a new property and they will be assessed by agents they will help you through the whole process after getting the approval. Agents will help declining another very, very, very complex part of this process in Chile that means getting the documentation, going through the processes, and then the closing stage. Asians will help the client just to accelerate that to prevent a lot of, a lot, a lot of interaction. And obviously get as fast as possible and. After the sale, We are also considering a marketplace where. The providers or the different the different companies interact with the clients in order to get. The offer that the clients need to put together the offer that the clients need in order to purchase services and goods. This is one of one of the slides I I I like most because it reflects. The level of ambition. We set for this kind of process. So first of all. We are trying. To reduce By 15 days, the total time for mortgage approval and processing a clientele. We are also trying to reduce the closing time. In particular, after the, the, the processing of the of the credit is being made and that final stage where everybody got stressed, so they want everybody the seller wants to get the money as fast as possible, the, the client wants to get his house, so we are, we are making it 30% faster. So as I mentioned before, interactions will be key in order to get these results. We will, we will reduce by half interactions between individual and business clients. One very interesting topic I I I I definitely love. We are considering for certain properties 0 days. 0 days and disputes for the fine appraisals that means that for those properties appraisals will be will be made instantly. And automatically. So this will change everything in the local market. So and regarding the processing cost, they will gradually decline, reaching around 30%. Once the system is fully operational. So As we have mentioned before. We, we made this. We made this new operational model where Bancostado. Contributes. With their unique expertise in the local market, knowing their customers, knowing their products, knowing the ecosystem at all. And IBM shines to bring the technological capabilities, the operational capabilities, sorry, that, uh, with along with AWS providing infrastructure help us put all together. And integrate processes, business logics and data in order to. In order to produce this concept that we are starting to call the online. Operative model for a genetic AI. That will be a combination of forces of different sources where people and nagent will interact and will help us foster. The culture that Banco Estado pursues. With our capabilities in order to create new ways of working for Chile and for the customers. So Obviously that a great part of this conception and this implementation. Is allowed by our very strong partnership with AWS. Our partnership grew. Very rapidly during the last 4 years we made huge steps every year and so it allowed us to deploy to build and deploy very complex solutions in just in a very quick time. And also it helps us strengthen our teams. In advanced technologies. Uh And this, and this is, uh, we believe that this will get even better. So right now we are awarded with with different. With different uh prices regarding our capabilities and agentic AI our specific capabilities that we have with AWS for financial services and also we were recognized for our capabilities in the consulting in the consulting business. Yes. And obviously there is more to come here. But But we, we want, we want it, we really, we really want it. To make a special announcement. Maybe a couple of days earlier, but I think this this will be the the right time to do it. Soledad, uh, finally we invite, uh, the audience to learn more about this initiative, uh, the new quarter of what is represent, um, the housing platform will be launched next week, uh, uh, check bancostao.c. Uh, starting December 9th. Yeah Wait Bruno. Well Um, can they keep a secret? Can you keep a secret? You are asking if they can. Yeah, search in your search in your browser casa verso.co. Yeah. What happened in Vegas stay in Vegas. Thank you. OK, OK, we are, we are very proud of having the opportunity of, of announce it here. Oh, like it's like it's a little bit weird announcement, but we, we, we said it. So, um, Obviously we we've been talking a lot and uh we were talking about the complexity of building discovering deploying. Agent EI nowadays, in particular in in in financial services. Now I would like to introduce Vikram Murali, Vikram Murai, who will talk. A lot more about what are the real needs in terms of scaling in terms of managing efficiency and in terms of making sustainable for the future. So Briram, thanks. And thank you all have a good rest of the day. Thank you. Can you guys hear me? Perfect. There is no feedback, so I think that's why um we keep taking the mic away. So first of all, you know, we all talk about AI and agents and all of that, right? So the first half of the presentation, um, to me that's very, very important because we want to understand from our customers, from our clients as to how they are using AI, how they're using agents, what is the return of investment, return on investment, right? Um, so that's, that's a phenomenal story. Thanks for sharing with us, Bruno. So Once you talk about AI and agentic frameworks and agents, you create agents, the next question becomes how do you scale these agents? How do you make sure that these agents are cost effective when you run them? And what we are seeing, uh, from an IBM perspective is our customers on AWS, uh, they are building more gente capabilities than ever in the last, I would say probably 12 months. The pace of adoption has accelerated dramatically now when this happens with any new technology, when any new thing that comes, um, you know, in the field. Uh, we see a few issues. So one of the first issues we see is around the dynamic nature of agenttic AI. And what I mean by that is, so imagine in place of agents, if you had, um, you know, an SRE doing some work or a human doing a work, there were predictive paths that that human would have taken, you know, from run books and things like those. But now with agent E AI it's really, really complex and dynamic in the sense that. Agents are, you know, they can, they can think about various different paths, and you cannot predict which path they will take, and that's the whole purpose of an agent, right? They are autonomous, they can take, uh, you know, uh, they can think about different paths they can evaluate much faster than humans can, so there is much more complexity involved in running these aids in such scale. So that's one of the first problems that we see. The second issue that we see is the diverse infrastructures and tools that these agents will have to connect to. So in agent EKI, one of the things that I've had so many customer conversations since morning, one of the common theme that is coming up is customers want to use agents. Clients want to use agents to take automated actions. That's the whole point. Now, how much do you trust an agent from taking an automated action? And if you have to take an automated action, you may have to give up control. You may have to give connectivity to agents to multiple infrastructures. The agent could be running on one cloud, but the infrastructure and tools that it needs to connect to could be running on any cloud, could be running on prem. So you have to give up that control. So that's the second biggest barrier that we see is the diverse infrastructure and tools that these, uh, agents will have to connect to. The third area that we see is the rapid change. I mean, if you take like a week off, go on vacation, go on a cruise, and come back, there'll be a new platform, a new, you know, something to do with the agent TKI, um, uh, uh, a new, um, uh, method to create agents, to monitor agents, observe agents. So this field is rapidly evolving, and we see customers struggling to adapt. And if you look at traditional development methods and development practices, um, there was a particular rhythm in doing things. Now that rhythm has completely gone out the window, so customers and clients and end users have to rapidly evolve and change when you talk about using agents and then having these agents in, uh, production and, and scaling them and so on and so forth. So these are some of the areas we believe, you know, customers are struggling with. Now what do you do about it? To make agents really enterprise ready we deal with large enterprises. I mean the previous example was a bank we deal with banks, financial institutions, um, you know, the insurance industry, so many different large enterprises. So to make sure agents are truly enterprise ready, the number one thing is to make sure that you have enough control and confidence that these agents are reliable. And that they can be consistent, they're always available and they are scalable, right? So these are main areas that you need to concentrate on when you're building and deploying these agents. The second area that we believe that you need to concentrate on is around performance and the value. What is the ROI for, you know, when you deploy these agents. Now if something costs you $10 and you're bringing automation in and the automation is going to cost you $20 you can't do automation just for the sake of doing it, right? There needs to be an ROI. So we always look at how are these agents performing, what is the cost of running these agents, what is the save, right, the return on investment that you're getting by going agentic, and then how are these agents performing. Right? How much, uh, CPU, GPU, infrastructure they're consuming, all of these things are very, very crucial, and these are things which become day 2, day 3, items that customers are, you know, they, they don't look at it from day one. So let's assume everyone knows how to build agents, you know, you build your own agents, you have a reason why you want to build agents, you want to deploy agents. So let's skip that topic here. What we are talking about is when you build these agents, make sure that you think about these day two activities. You want to build agents in a framework where you can observe them. You need to know what is happening, why is an agent behaving in a particular way. So you need to observe them. So observability is key when you talk about agent TKI. The second area is optimizing. So make sure these agents can run in a particular optimized way, not just with the workload, with a POC with a proof of value that you established, but when you open the floodgates and when hundreds and thousands of customers come in, these agents need to perform exactly the same way, so performance and scalability are going to be very, very important. Now automation, so automation again, like I said, I, I had so many customer meetings since morning. Almost every client that I met, the one thing that they are looking at agent EKI is to help them with automation. Some call it self healing, some call it automation, some call it auto remediation, but at the end of the day, how can you remove that human in the loop or maybe reduce the human in the loop to maybe a one click approval, right? Let the agent take that decision. So for that, automation is key. And the last area is govern now just because you have these agents and they're taking automated actions, you need to have secure policies in place. So we, as I said, we work with a lot of large enterprise customers and there are control compliance control frameworks, uh, in every region in the Americas, in EMEA, in, uh, AP and so on, and you need to make sure that there are proper governance controls and policies set in place that way you can control what these agents are doing. Now if you look at IBM, um, we have, I come from the IBM automation side I lead development for IBM automation and uh we have these uh capabilities that we use both we take it to customers which helps them observe and automate as well as, uh, you know, monitor these agents, but we also use agents internally and the next few slides I'll go through how exactly we do this. Now the first product that we have, the offering that we have is called IBM Instana. This is our answer to our application performance monitoring tool. Now I don't look at agents as something different. Applications are going to be using agents, so which means we should be able to monitor these agents using the same APM tools. We can't invent new tools to say, we, uh, you know, you're going to monitor agents, so we have to use the exact same tools. So Instana delivers full stack observability and with that it delivers AI observability including agentic observability as well. And one of the differences with Instana and some of the other tools in the market is that we collect data every second. Now there are tools out there that collect data every 5 seconds or 8 seconds or 15 seconds, right? But we collect data every single second. We look at metrics, events, logs, everything that happens around an agent every second. So when it comes to root cause analysis, that there's nothing better than this particular offering here. And by the way, everything that I'm gonna walk you through the next few slides, we use these within IBM for our own products both in development and when we run our products at scale for our customers as well. The second one is turboonomic. Now turbonomic started with cost optimization, resource optimization. Now if you dial back 345 years back when chat GPT came on and LLMs were the big craze at the time, everyone wanted GPUs. At IBM we did have a bunch of GPUs. Every developer wanted GPUs to go do whatever they wanted to do with uh their ML training. But one thing we found is that about 60% of GPUs were not even being utilized. That's where Turbonomic came in. We turned Turbonomic on on our own development practices within IBM and very quickly we found that developers who are waiting in line. Because GPUs were not available and they were assigned to developers who are not even using them, 60% were wastage, so Turboonomic is that tool that can help you from a resource optimization perspective. We don't have infinite resources, right? Capital is, you know, um, a constant, and, uh, it is limited, and we need to make sure that whatever you're spending on, you really need to spend on and it's not just sitting idle and especially cost becomes a huge problem if you're developing on the cloud. The next one is web methods. Now web methods is a very interesting, um, you know, offering that we have with IBM. And what web web methods enables you to do is it enables agents to run in a secure governed area, and the security and governance is just not for agents. Web web methods is known for API, security, and API governance. That's where it started. And we are extending that to LLMs, large language models, and multiple enterprise assets, and to us we see agents as one of those enterprise assets. Again, if you haven't checked out web methods, it's our go to answer from a hybrid, um, IPA perspective, so please go check it out. Uh, it's the only way to make sure that your agents are running in a more secure and governed way. Now how do we improve operations with Agentech AI within our products? Now it's not always about telling customers what they need to do. It's about within Instana. If we look at Instana, it's a product that has been here for 8 years. So we constantly are looking at within the product to see how we can do code optimization within the product. Now one of the areas that we came up with, this is called incident investigation. So Instana is used for root cause analysis. When something happens, we want to catch it. We want to know why it happened that way we can avoid and Instana does learn from it and we want to avoid it. So this agent helps with um improving incident investigation and it learns from it and it gets better and in most cases it's able to proactively tell you this was the signature of the event when it happened the previous time. And when it is about to happen, it can tell you the same thing happened two weeks back and it led to an outage. Take action, right? So this is one way we are using it um in our other offering called concert we have an agent that helps with auto compliance and resiliency. Now compliance, we are not a GRC tool. There are a dime a dozen out there, but if you look at compliance controls like Nest and SOC 2 and all of these other compliance controls out there, about 60% of these controls are not even. You can't write a piece of program to go evaluate it. So how do you use agency AI to go through documentation? One of my favorite examples is a NIST control called um media control. So if you are using media, if you're on-prem, if you're using a hard disk drive or an SSD that goes bad, your vendor like Dell or Intel or IBM can't just come swap it out and take the old hard drive. You need to have a chain of command to destroy that disk drive. Now how do you prove that with automation, right? Those are the areas that we are investing in and this compliance and resilient agent, it can help you with that. So Gartner has, um, you know, we are a leader in several of these Gartner magic quadrants if you look at Instana from an application performance management observability perspective, uh, we are a leader, um, you know, in that quadrant, um, CRN, we were a leader last year, we may, we were a finalist this year, um, and same thing with some of our other products, API Connect and Web Methods as well. So each one of these products can stand in its own right. And I, I think one of, what I want to leave this audience with is. Any time there is new technology that comes out, we don't want to come out and say forget about all the tools that you used in the past, we're going to invent a new set of tool chain for you to go monitor, maintain, observe, and make sure that these can perform at scale. We are not going to be doing that, so instead we were able to extend our existing tool sets and existing technologies to go monitor your new technology as well. OK, um, so enough of listening from me. I'm gonna bring my client panel up. So I would like to welcome and hear from our clients. Um, Ganesh Somaskandan is the vice president of Thesis, and, uh, Sagar Chikala is the CIO of Flexivan. Please join me on stage. How are you gentlemen doing? Doing good. OK, um, so Sagan and Ganesh, thank you for joining me today. Now, before we get into AI and how you use it, can you tell us a little bit about your companies, um, what they do, uh, what business you're in, and some of the challenges that you have faced in the last few years. So let me start with you, Ganesh. Thank you, Vikram. Uh, can you guys hear me? OK, perfect. So yeah, I'm Gareshha Moskanan. I'm from, uh, Global Payments. So basically we are into the, uh, issuing organization where we take care of the payments in every, um, life cycle of the credit card. It, it starts from you either you apply for the credit card or you, uh, you swipe your card in the POS terminals. It goes through the authorizations and it becomes the transaction. Or even when you go into the phases of like your self-management like an online banking where you take care of like you do the card controls or anything, you name it, we offer the services for our clients, which are like really high critical um mission clients. The, the main factor, what we are doing is like we are obviously in the modernization journey. So with respect to that, like we have the hybrid um platform, which means like we have the on-prem and the big cloud presence with AWS. So that's, um, that's what like our background is, uh, Vikram, yeah. Thanks, Vikram. Uh, can you hear me? So Flexivan actually Chassis leasing company. I think before you understand what is Chassi, I want to tell, um, how imports comes, right? Imagine we are getting imports from Asia to US. For example, it's going to Chicago. When the ship arrives at the port. The container Discharge it from the port and has to go to the warehouse, right? The container doesn't have wheels, so it needs an equipment which has the wheels, which is called a chassis. As you know, the logistics. The from a port to the warehouse. You don't have the visibility until it reaches the warehouse. Right? So that is where we started the company called American Enter Model in 2016, 10 years back. With a smart chassis concept. So we equipped chassis with the IOT devices. Like a GPS Which gives the location, velocity. We also have the mount sensor. When a content is placed on the chassis. It tells and container actually removed from the chassis, it provides the state of the asset, and we also have a weight sensor. It provides what is the weight of the container on top of the chassis. So with all these sensors capturing the data from the senses. And getting the data from the customers. The terminals Railroads, container yards, getting all the contested data, augmenting with the sensor data. That's how we developed supply chain visibility platform, which we call AIM 360. It's very, very helpful because with this one, customers know when it started from a port, when it's coming to a warehouse, they know ETA when it's going to arrive, so they can plan accordingly. Right? It's not only giving the real-time tracking and visibility, it also provides network insights because it generates a customer network. Where it is actually stuck in that particular journey, how long it is dwelling at a particular warehouse, where is the wastage in that network. So we provide all those insights to the customers such that customers can use it to reduce the cost of operations. As you see the whole journey, we scaled up 1,000s, then went to the 100s, 1000s of assets. As we increase the scale, we ended up with so many integrations. Integrations with the customers, B2B integrations, getting EDI, getting XML data, integrations for the sensors, integration with the API, the systems. And we ended up, is it really all these integrations working as a silo, it's really, really challenging. That is where we migrated all these integrations into our integration backbone, which is a web methods. No, that is, um, thank you for sharing that, you know, especially now we just went past the Thanksgiving holiday last weekend and then going into Christmas I'm sure from a logistics perspective it's going to be, uh, you know, a nightmare if you don't have insight into your operations, right? And same thing with global payments as well it's like, you know, um, customers nowadays if you look at the Apple card and other cards that we are used to, we, we expect everything to happen instantaneously. So, um, very insightful. So one of the other questions I had for you is, um, maybe we'll start with you, Sagar. Um, so what has your company's journey been with AI and, and what do you see the future? OK. I think we just discussed the logistics, right? It's always reactive. I think most of you sometimes face the, the supply delay. When flight is delayed, it impacts the connective flights, right? Same as when a ship is delayed. Imagine it's coming from Asia, it has to go to Chicago. So it arrives, the ship arrives at the LA. From LA to Chicago, it might go on a train. So when the ship is delayed, it actually delays all the connected conveyances. So it's very important. To address the problem. That is where we started our journey. How can we make The reactive to proactive, so we started a predictive logistics. So, same problem, like you have assets. But there is no demand. Where there is a demand, you might not have assets. So there's a lot of network imbalance. So to address this problem, the predictive logistics, we have so much of data, billions of events based on this GPS and all the sensors. We train the data and we're able to develop a predictive model which is going to actually predict the velocity, supply chain velocity. It's going to predict how many assets the customer needs it. When a container comes, if there is no chassis, container cannot move. So chassis is very, very important. So we're able to predict how many chassis for that customer needs by location. By customer. So that's how our journey started with the predictor logistics. Then, when you, when I explained about the whole GPS and we're able to derive the whole container trip. GPS provides a signature of the trip, node to node. But the main important thing is the container and the cargo inside the container. So it's very important to connect what is inside the container to the chassis, because sensors are on the chassis, which provides the GPS signature. So to connect the container to the chassis. The data we are getting from the ports is not enough, so we install the cameras. Each locations where we get the video feed, then we implemented AI vision. It's a YOLO model we use that one. So we have AI vision engine to process those videos to identify the object, then OCR to derive what is the actual container ID and what's the chances C ID. Once we have the container ID, we have the cargo inside, then we provide the cargo tracking in real time. So that's how we went with the AI vision. Then later, as LLMs came, then we started the journey with the LLM. We implemented our own Flexi GPT. That's an LLM on our own enterprise data. We also expanded LLM to our portal to provide LLM-based user experience. So, typical, any website, when you go, you click on a link or menus, you provide the data, right? But our portal actually based, you can ask the questions, where are my problems? Where is my assets? Based on that, it actually dynamically derived the UI. Then we expanded our journey to the Asiatic. Because we have so much of manual, right? typical any business, when you look at it, there are a lot of back office functionalities. When you get invoice processing invoice or getting the data, go to the websites, then manually updating that one. So we implemented MCPs on each legacy system we have it because agent has to connect to a legacy system to perform action. So we actually built the MCP gateway connecting to each legacy system. And working with the agent to execute the business process. So all the journey, when you look at it, Data and integration is very, very important. It is the backbone. Without data, there's no AI, right? So, the backbone for all our ecosystem actually is the web methods. Oh, that's, that's, uh, you know, I, I, I keep thinking about, uh, my own household when we go and order something on AWS. We expect it to show up in 24 hours or less, right? We, we don't understand the logistics and everything that goes behind it, so that's, that's very insightful. So what's your, uh, take? Yeah, uh, definitely, as I said that, um, the payments you mentioned about the, the holiday shopping and everything. If I have to really share that, uh, the number of transactions we just processed on the Cyber Monday, it was like close to 1.5 billion transactions in a day, which means you, you see like how critical those are the applications and from our client commitment perspective and also we know that like even if you miss like 5 minutes, you may lose the deal as a customer, so. At the same time, you need to have like a better model in place such as with good observability. That is critical for even though you have great functionalities that you can offer. If you don't have the good scalability or reliability, and if you are not able to react very quickly, then you lose the customer, you lose your credibility and everything. So that's where like our journey with our observability started. And I would say like even the you I know like um Pikram you touched base about the Instana so we, we started using that in our hybrid platform because ours is like it's kind of like yes we have the great partnership with the AWS we have our uh APIs and other application that runs in the cloud. however, like we have still the on-prem presence with the mainframe and the and the components. With all this, we are talking about like such a mission critical, we need the complete entry and observability and not just like from the static one. So we want to make sure we have, we are taking advantage of every AA solutions that we are getting through the observability tools. The 11 thing I would say is like, um, the auto-healing. That's really like critical. We don't want using the instrument, let's say like I just go and set up the alarms and I set it up. That's not the job is done. We want to make sure that like, you identify the issues, and you don't want to be like reactive always. You want to be proactive, so you take care of the automated-based observability so that like you can let the, let it itself like heal the system. There is no need to have, that's why like we are marching towards and that helped us really on the MTTR. The other one I would say is like the, the turboonomics. That's again like the very critical because many companies, we are in the process of the modernization journey. So the challenge is you need to take care of your on-prem because you have the clients and you have to move it into the cloud. So that means like you have to take care of your cost. And with the turboonomics and other things in the place, that's where like we can get like the more efficiencies with respect to handling your processing. You gave the classic example of the GPUs which are not used by the, the developers and other pieces, so that's definitely where we are marching towards on that, yeah. No, thank you. Thank you for sharing. Um. My next question, and I'll stick with you, um, Ganesh, so with everything around AI and agenttic AI, uh, like I don't know of a single CIO or, uh, you know, a C-suite exec, uh, who doesn't have AI on their roadmap, right? They wanna do something, which means there is a lot of pressure within enterprises, um, to go do something with AI. But then if you look at downstream processes, there are people who are very reluctant to give up control. They are afraid of security and resilience and governance. So how do you, how do you tackle that? Definitely, I think uh that's kind of like uh a very common questions we get from uh everyone including our uh customers and our clients because there is always a sensitivity about when you put something in the cloud, where is the security or when you have the AII when you lose the control to the AII. It's all about the mindset and like how we are actually like implementing and what is the advantage by doing that. It's not about like we're replacing the resource or it's like we are just eliminating that. The way we see it as like, it's kind of like you're bringing in the quality of life to your team, to your, to your engineers, because it's not really worth for your engineering team to spend time on the repetitive task. Instead of that, they can focus more on more innovation, the more products which will benefit the customer base and the clients and as a company. So that, that's one of the uh rhythm like we kind of, we try to expand that to across our organization that name it as NEA generation-based one. It's, it's about like productivity and you, you spend focus on other things, yeah. I like it the way you put it, improve the quality of your engineers. I think that's one good way to sell it, yeah. Yeah, the technology is evolving, right, you know, every day we see some product, um. And as you see the expo, I see a lot of new products I see today. So one of the important factor is we use the technology. To take advantage of it and get some revenue, right, or to reduce the costs. Or sometimes we use the technology because if I don't, I will be left behind. So I have to use it to show the competitive advantage. But I strongly believe that A use case with the ROI dictates the innovation, not the other way. So it's very important to have the business use case to have a successful implementation of any AA project. Well said, um, I think I started to hear, uh, more from clients on that same thought. They, they don't want to, uh, hear about offerings or what they can do. They, it's all about use cases. So what is the use case and, uh, how can you make my life better with what you're proposing, right? So I think that's a good thought. Thank you. Yeah, sorry, uh, I just want to, um, talk about because when we think about the, the risk and the speed, there should be always a balance, right? You look at our journey. If I look at the three pillars of all our integrations, one pillar is about all the legacy B2B integration. The second pillar is about API gateway. And the third pillar is all about this MCP MCP gateway and AI gateway. All these three pillars of the integration. are orchestrated. True IBM Web Methods hybrid control panel. And providing an NT and visibility so we are actually migrating to that one. I'm very, very excited about the product and really kudos to the product team. Thank you. I'll convey that. So thank you, Ganesh and Sagar, for, uh, you know, joining me today and sharing your stories. I think, uh, it's very powerful, um, to the audience. Thank you. We do have a booth out here, uh, that is the IBM observability booth, the web, uh, methods booth. Um, and go check it out. Go check out our demos, and if you have any questions, feel free to stop by the booth and talk to our technical folks there. Uh, they'll be more than happy to answer any questions you have. OK? Thank you and have a good one. Thank you, Vikro.
