Welcome to Reinvent 2025. My name is Umai Sampit. I'm the director for training products at AWS. I'm also enlightened to welcome my my good friend, um, Julio Blanco Perez uh from Santander. He's gonna share the stage with me today and talk about um AI skills. So Julio, if you wouldn't mind kinda introducing yourself, he's he's the acting CEO at at Santander. I'm really excited about the portion of the presentation that Julio is actually gonna deliver today because it brings home a lot of what we wanna talk about. Thank you. If you can hear me too, it's all right. Thank you, Mesh for having me. I really Uh thrilled to be here to share what we've been doing for the last 2 years. In partnership with AWS, yeah, no, exciting, uh, times ahead like, uh, I was very thrilled about what Santander was able to do, um, how they've been able to leverage a lot of the like mechanisms that we'll talk about in the products that we've built at AWS, uh, particularly around upskilling their workforce, and they, and they see some really practical outstanding results. So looking forward to Julio kind of talking a little bit about that, uh, towards the, uh, second part of the, the presentation. So let me kinda start with. What is, what, like, let me kinda talk a little bit about what we'll cover today. Largely we're actually gonna talk a little bit about the challenges and the opportunities that exist from AI and particularly around AI upskilling and why it's important both for individuals as well as for organizations. Next we'll actually cover uh how SkillBuilder, how we're act how we've evolved SkillBuilder and how we continue to actually make SkillBuilder available with AI powered experiences that actually help you achieve the AI transformation and AI skilling that you're looking for at scale and then to bring it home, uh, I'll hand the mic over to to Julio who will walk us through Santander's story. So we'll spend about 20-25 minutes. Uh, just talking about the problem space and, and the approach that we're taking and then we'll, we'll actually land with the practical aspect, uh, of Santander's story. So let me kinda start with a few stats, some data, um, just to kinda land um the challenge in front of us. According to the World Economic Forum, the jobs report in 2025, 40% of core job skills are expected to change by 2030. Just reflect on that for a second. That's nearly half. The the world's population is going to see changes in skills. So it's an interest really interesting challenge for all of us and ahead of us, particularly around, around upscaling. The other statistic that I wanna share is um AWS ran a research study across several different organizations. We're most of these organizations that we talked to, 92% of them said they plan to have AI projects either in the works or in production by 2028. However, 3 out of 4, or 75% of them said that they can't find the talent. That they need, so there's this really interesting gap of. Ambition and capability. And um this is actually really interesting. I see some heads nodding in in the crowd. This is a a really interesting time for all of us around AA upskilling. The other aspect of this challenge that makes it a bit more interesting and complicated in some ways is this idea of half-life or skills half-life. According to Forbes, this was an article published in, in Forbes in, in 2024. I still think it's relevant, so we've included it on the slide. The half-life for Jobs in the 1980s was about 10 years. In 2024, that was about 4. And Forbes, the Forbes article through the Stanford study. Shows that that half-life for skills could actually be just 2 years in the next 2 to 4 years. So what's happening is AI skills are evolving pretty quickly. And constant continuous learning is is essentially going to be required no longer nice to have so this is the other aspect of what we're actually seeing uh in terms of how the skills are actually evolving. Now we've talked about challenges so far. Let's actually talk a bit about the opportunities. A study that was done by Skillsoft's IT Skills and salary report indicates that individuals that possess AI skills. Tend to make 47% higher in compensation. So if you can actually be decisive about taking control of your career and your, your, your AI skilling, um, and, and essentially bring AI skilling as a part of your, your professional development, you have the opportunity to tap into that that premium it's not a small percent lift in in terms of compensation so there's a really interesting mix of challenge and opportunity that we see from a a AI skilling standpoint. So let's talk a little bit about how the modern learner's journey is evolving as well. Obviously technical skills and core skills have been part of learning for a long time. That's not changing. The foundational aspects continue to still be incredibly relevant. However, complementary to those foundational aspects are human centric skills. And and generative AI and AI technologies are actually making it a lot easier for for products like ours, frankly, that can bring human centric skills to complement the technology focused skills. So human centric skills, particularly like communication, critical thinking, relationship building, these are all integrated into learning experiences today and we'll talk a little bit about how SkillBuilder has evolved to support uh these capabilities. The other aspect that is changing quite rapidly is this idea that. People don't have time professionally, personally, and so taking out 23 days from your work, some people can can still do it, but oftentimes micro-learning is becoming much more of the norm. It's like 15 minutes. Uh, I have 15 minutes to learn something. I have a couple hours to learn something, and so this idea of, of transactional learning, making it fun and engaging is the other aspect of what we're actually seeing the individual's learning journey and how it's evolving. So let me reframe the, the learning cycle if you will. We obviously think of the learning cycle through the learn lens where you're learning concepts you practice it to reinforce your learning, you prepare for credentials or exams, and then you basically get let's say an AWS certification and that's traditionally been sort of the waterfall approach. however, what we're actually observing. Is that the learn and practice phase are getting smaller and much more continuous. So you learn bursts of concepts, you practice them in the same experience. And that actually helps you go back and forth. You can actually do this micro learning thing back and forth multiple times. You learn a concept, you practice it, you learn the next concept, you practice it. If you need to reinforce the first concept you learn, you could do that. You could, this, this also helps you in the context of what you're, you're working on. So while you're actually solving a problem, you say, yeah, I need 30 minutes. I'm actually gonna go learn a concept, practice it, and then come back to my real, real world. Uh, real work that I'm doing and so this idea of micro learning is becoming much more of the norm and it supports this idea of continuous learning that we saw, um, previously in terms of one of the challenges. Once you've amassed A body of knowledge and you've accumulated these concepts across uh across a single domain, you can actually go into the prepare phase and then once you actually have prepared for your exams you can get credentials. So this AI powered personalization is really actually helping a lot of our learners. So let me dive a little bit deeper on the loan phase. AWS Skill Builder provides 330 or so resources and ever growing. To actually help you grow your AI skills. And those are a combination of technical skills where you learn core concepts or you can actually go deeper if you're interested in learning deeper concepts with AI as well as human centric skills. And so we've actually built products that bring those experiences together where you can learn, you can practice, and you can actually practice both technical skills and human centered skills. I'll talk a lot about these products that you see on the slide here where it talks about. AI powered immersive learning experiences like Simularn or meeting simulators so I'll cover those in in a bit more detail as we walk through the the presentation today. Let's talk about the practice phase. If you're interested in building a role or industry expertise, we have a series of products that actually help you do that. For example, top left, you see Cloud Quest. Cloud QQuest is a 3D game product where you can actually learn cloud concepts. In essentially a a a game based learning experience you can try out a variety of AWS services in that in the same game. And you can actually learn, learn concepts, practice it, solve the quest, go to the next one, and so on. So these experiences around micro-learning are built in to essentially the skill builder product set. Similarly, if you're just interested in like looking at, at labs, you can actually go and practice a lot of the concepts within Build a labs or, or jam sessions. These are again products that help you practice what you've actually learned. In a real AWS environment. You can develop communications and human centric skills through products like Meeting Simulator and Simulant. And then the other aspect of what we've actually learned with with practice is group-based learning. But you can actually Use Car Clash, which is essentially a a game-based product that helps you go head to head with individuals and you can actually learn in a group-based format. So again, these learn and practice experiences are built right into the product set with AWS Skill Builder. Let's take a look at some of the products that I mentioned slightly in more depth as we walk through the presentation. So, Cloud Quest, generative AI practitioner, it's primarily designed for someone interested in foundational skills. But essentially, you're in a 3D virtual city and you take, you're, you're actually learning from guided experiences that are built into the game. You go through um recommendations and you actually try out your recommendations in real world AWS environments right there in that experience so it's bringing. Learning and practicing all within the entire in essentially the same experience. And so you learn, you get hands-on experience with Amazon Bedrock, with SageMaker, with Que Developer, and the list goes on. You can also learn about essentially foundational models, prompt engineering, you can learn about rag uh implementation concepts, and so on. And this is an ever growing list of capabilities that we're adding continuously. I mentioned with Skill Builder we have 330 such resources we continuously add to them as new technology comes out. If you're not quite friendly to a 3D based game type learning format, we have Simmi-learn. Essentially, Simulearn is mimicking a real-world scenario for you. So it's a simulated learning experience where you engage with AI powered virtual agents. And essentially you're gathering requirements, you're developing architectural recommendations, you're providing essentially proposals to AI agents, and these agents are actually providing you feedback on two things. One is the technical skills that you're learning. The other is the human centric skills, particularly around communication. So you get the entire feedback right within the context of the stimulated learning environment. So it's a, it's a nifty experience and. What we've noticed is like when we look at engagement data, particularly with Cloud Quest and with Simulon, our engagement numbers with learners is incredibly high. When compared to traditional digital learning formats, because you're actually bringing these two experiences together. In a, in a micro learning format and by the way it's perfect for either you're starting off or you're actually developing advanced architectural concepts we have a ton of different courses in SimiLearn that actually specifically cover generative AI architecture plans. Next, I wanna talk about Meeting Simulator. This is a super interesting launch. Uh, we launched this product not too long ago, um, November 12th, just last month. And um this is actually primarily focused on on developing human centric skills. So it simulates real world high stakes conversations through voice or text. So again it's fascinating. This is where we've actually leveraged AI and generative AI technologies to improve and make our learning. Um, products better, but also we're actually leveraging them to teach AI and AI concepts. So in this case you can actually um simulate practical scenarios. So for example you can simulate scenarios where you're discussing cost conversations with the CFO and the agent persona goes back and forth and gives you real time feedback on how you're communicating. So if you're essentially preparing for a technical sales role or you're preparing for stakeholder type roles, these, this product would actually be perfect for you. Next, once you've amassed. Sufficient body of knowledge. Where you've gone back and forth with micro learning, you can prepare for certification exams. And we've made preparation for the certification exams quite easy. You get to know your exam. You refresh your skills. You can review and practice through exam style questions. And then like, essentially self assess, are you ready to take an AWS certification or not? These certifications tend to be several hours long with multiple choice questions back and forth, so going through a preparation phase actually helps individuals. Now, before I dive into what are the specific AIML certifications that we have um published or launched. I wanna talk a little bit about why certifications are important. Remember the 47% compensation bump that I talked about? Knowing the skills is one thing, but having the credentials on your resume helps you overcome because it actually validates for prospective employers that you actually know the AI skills. The other aspect, um, is, and this is, these are some stats that I'll, I'll kind of share more broadly, it's about a million unique individuals today, um, that possess over a million that possess AWS certifications and some of them possess multiple certifications. So it's, it's actually quite popular amongst individuals but also frankly amongst prospective employers. We actually ran a study and we asked organizations. Do these certifications mean a lot and I know Julio will talk a little bit about this, um, with Santander as well, but interestingly enough, 90 91% of the organizations we spoke to said that having AWS certified staff increased innovation in their companies. Also, 90% plus said that they were able to reduce costs. So we see both innovative and productivity gains for organizations when you actually are hiring individuals with. AWS certifications. Now let me talk a little bit about the 4 certifications that we have. We have a total of about 12 certifications. Um, AI practitioner foundational, it's sort of validating that you know foundational concepts in AI. Machine Learning Engineer associate is actually really validating that, you know, essentially machine learning and deep learning concepts, model tuning, those types of things. Data Engineer associate is a really interesting one. oftentimes to get agentic applications built, data and data pipelines are incredibly important and so data engineer associate helps validate essentially the, the data pipelines are in place and you're set up to build those agentic applications and then, uh, we're proud to announce on November 18th the beta version of generative AI professional. Um, so this is a, a developer certification that helps validate that you can actually build agentic applications. So we're excited, um, with these certifications and just, just so you know, machine learning engineer and data engineer have been around for some time, but they've been updated with more recent questions and, and, uh, essentially skills that validate agentic capabilities. We've also heard from a lot of our learners that taking these certifications can be onerous. And so we were, we were excited to again announce that we launched microcredentials. These microcredentials are actually incredibly valuable because they actually provide real real-time assessment in real AWS environments. Unlike certifications that have Q&A where they're testing your knowledge, these, uh, microcredentials actually validate hands-on skills. So your assessments are actually within AWS environments and you can prove that not only you know the the concept and theory but you actually know how to operate those services at scale. Currently we have two, that we launched on on November 12th AWS Agenic AI demonstrated and AWS Ceris demonstrated. These complement our certifications really well and they actually go hand in hand with the concept of micro learning. So now imagine. You learn, you practice, you validate. And you do it in smaller chunks and you rinse and repeat and you're essentially amassing a body of knowledge continuously. So that's kind of a bit of a recap of. The individual journey where we talked about learn and practice getting closer to one another. Preparation for exams becomes part of the journey after you've actually gone back and forth with learn and practice with microcredentials you can do a a certain percentage of validations in that learn and practice phase. And then validate actually is either through microcredentials or or certifications. So that's your path as an individual to AI career. And hopefully the success that comes behind it. Now Now that we've talked about individuals, let's actually talk about what happens within organizations. One of the most powerful ways we believe uh to build culture is through collaborative team-based learning and Julio will talk about this like I'm really excited about his talk where he brings it brings this together. But essentially we've built a series of products that actually help collaborative team-based learning. Remember I mentioned Cloud Quest, which was essentially the, the 3D game for individuals, the Cloud Quest tournaments for organizations. So it's really open ended. You learn, you solve problems together in real world AWS environments as teams competing against one another in a healthy way. And you actually get the engagement at the team level. AWS jams have been around for some time. These are open-ended lab-based problems where teams get together and actually solve real world challenges. There's leader bodes you can actually see who's doing what. Uh, you can set up your own challenges that you'd like. So again, super interesting, uh, way to actually get engagement across your teams. AWS Car Clash, it's a a game-based app that we've built. You can actually test your knowledge head to head with other individuals. It helps to learn, but it also helps to reinforce what you've learned. Escape Rooms is really, really popular one too. Escape rooms are actually group-based certification exam preparations. So if you've been in a physical escape room, it's a similar concept, it's virtual. And you can essentially go, you can actually solve problems together, learn, learn for actually certifications and once you actually get from one room to another, you're actually doing in in a group based learning format. So it's fun to kinda get prepared for an exam in a, in a group-based format. And then lastly, skillBuilder trivia. It's another way to actually reinforce knowledge through large scale team, uh, competition. Now, a lot of these formats are actually available at Rainvent. So, um, I'll talk a little bit about exactly where you'll find them. So if you really want to experience them firsthand, they're. Its present across several venues uh here at Reinvent 25. Let me talk about one more. Launch that we had on November 12th called Cohort Studio before I hand the the mic over to to Julio but Cohort Studio essentially one of the feedback that we had received uh from a lot of our customers and particularly uh in partnership with Santander even. Um Essentially Bringing a lot of these experiences together in a sing in in multiple of these experiences like Simulon or you know Clash or or jams etc. um together in a in a single experience uh was a problem for a lot of our customers particularly when they were actually looking to launch um. Team-based learning within their organization. So with cohort studio, anyone can launch a cohort program in in less than 15 minutes. It's AI powered. You can pick and choose the experiences that I talked about. And you can drive engagement and teamwork and recognition. Whether you're trying to organize a certification exam. Um, or you're actually trying to get AI skills boot camps ready, or you're actually looking at team competitions, you can actually do that in Cohort studio, so we're very excited about this launch, uh, and I have to thank like Santander to help like helping us actually figure out and visualize what this product would look like. With that, let me hand the mic over to Julio. Um, I'm really excited. He's the acting CEO again of, um, Santander Bank, and he's gonna walk you through how Santander took over some of the, the mechanisms and products that we've talked about and made it real and actually ran a program at scale, uh, in a financial services company. Thank you, Julio. Thank you, Mesh. Hello everybody again. I will first try to introduce Santander because I don't know if everybody knows Santander, but it's a bank of 180 years of history and that is really relevant when we are talking about, uh, cloud and AI for, uh, scaling training because we are a traditional bank and we are a global bank and we are. Dealing with products that deal with individuals from individuals to huge corporations, so we have a portfolio product that covers nearly everything that you think about in in banking. Probably we have a product that covers that. We have, uh, nearly 200 million customers and nearly €2 billion in managed assets, and also we are partnered with AWS since 2018 to scale the way that we. Deal with our customers we like to introduce ourselves as a digital bandwidth branches, so technology is embedded and should be embedded in everything that we do, but we also think that branches gives a lot of power and a lot of reach depending on on the people that we are dealing with, so. So really engaging in this hybrid approach between a digital, full digital bank and a traditional bank that has relationships through branches. And even if we are a digital global company, we are focusing here on a program that we launched two years ago in Brazil, so everything from here to the end of the presentation is Brazil-based, and we are trying to think about how to how to scale it throughout the throughout the company. So What's AWS Level up? I'm taking some words from the U from Umesh's presentation that Traditional learning is not working anymore, at least from our point of view in a big enterprise, launching lots of mandatory training does not scale. People don't want to be 3 days in a classroom with people of different levels, so in the end you don't get the things that you want that everybody on board that everybody wants to be learning. So we, but we also don't. Really See that we are there in terms of you as an employee employee manage your own. Training program by yourself. Getting into a skill builder, and trying to build everything that you need to to be able to be certified. So when we thought about how we will be Scaling our program, we mixed everything together. So Level up. It's just like a progression game. But we have rules, we have paths, we have A cadancy we have. 3 to 9 months, expectation depending on the complexity of the curses. And we designed it with AWS because, you know, they know they know a lot about their own platform and we mix our Our needs And our paths for certification with their with their knowledge. So, uh, more or less how it works. When you on board when you get on boarded. You are assigned with a study group that more or less fits. Your knowledge and what certification you're gonna, you're gonna get. And then you're also boarded on Skill Builder. So you have a clear path of where your next train, but you are also able to do it by yourself. You can get courses from outside of your learning path, but what I'm saying, you have a cadence. People around you, uh, asking questions about the next training, asking if you got the, you are up to the to the training path, so everybody is trying is pushing the other members of the team forward. We started seeing that this is not something that we planned for, but we started seeing along the way that people started pushing each other. Because of the badges, because it's not a real gamification. We don't have a leadership, but you can see how other people in your study group are going. So in the end, you have a A little gamification. We didn't want a full gamification with a leadership, a champion in the end, because we wanted everybody to go on board and everybody to be pushing for the. for the training to go over. And we also, and I will be explaining you some slides, uh, in a, in a few slides. We thought about. How we were doing to Have something different for the people that went to the end and got certified. With, uh, we created what we call an AWS experience with kind of reinvent and uh our certified people can have a VIP lunch, lots of things over there. They are different teachers. They can show all over the organization that they are certified, so. They're kind of our VIP guys for the for the party. So, what I'm saying, we created a framework. So We created that kind of progression system throughout the throughout the process, so even we have lots of different parts for AI certifications for cloud practitioners, for solution architects. They have different paths, but in the end, everything goes through the same through the same way, through the same road. So different study groups. We have a Hard schedule, so if you are going to be certified in not certified, but going to the end of the training in 3 months, we schedule. Several trainings along the way, but we expect you to go forward, uh, on your own self-paced by, but you will be. You know, you're, uh, everybody will see that you are not, uh, doing your training with your, with your own group, which was something really, really. Interesting. And what what are we saying? More effective communication. was er starting to come up through all the teams that this is something that created a kind of spirit of community. That didn't have before we had other ways of training people. We had lots of AWS training. We had, uh, invested a lot in in training, not only with AWS whatever but we wouldn't. Get the same results. Until we got up this mixed system that I think that we reached the sweet spot between mandatory things and feeling free to go after, to go after knowledge. So let me switch a little bit over here. If you are a tech worker in Santander, Brazil, something from someone from our development uh teams. What would you see when you start your journey, you're on boarded. You are registered in our. In our portal, in our learning portal, it's available for many other things, and you are enrolled inside AWS Skill Builder. So that's the That, you know, the more traditional thing. You will go over there, you are on boarded, but then other things along the path are assigned to you. You are assigned, for example, for a Cloud West tournament. Um, people go together, um, play together to go to resolve all the, all that, all the different scenarios. We also have uh training sessions from SkillBuilder that are more or less sync for that particular team. We also have traditional what we call aloins in Portuguese, you know, a big, a big, uh, classroom which is the sync part of the training. Everybody goes there, uh, for some day for some specific topic, so we are not. Abandoning traditional traditional learning. Because there are some people from the team that don't really get that micro-learning strategy, they are, they are not there. So as we want everybody to go forward, we mixed everything up. Then we got everybody to practice their sums. They use similar. They use other platforms to simulate, to simulate the sums, and then we are ready. They pass. We have some evaluations, uh, for all the results. They, they got. They are given the AWS voucher to go for the certification. And then when everything is finished, as we are saying, it's a fixed timeline, at the end of the 3 months, 6 months, or 9 time, or 9 months, uh, project. We have a closing session. When we have some pricing giveaways, some devices or whatever that only the people that got certified. Can't get the can't get the prices, so it's Uh, the last mile gamification, it's not really big money, but you know that everybody wants to go on the stage, and get the device. That was from a point of the point of view of a person, but from the point of view of the organization. You can really see that we've got thousands of people on boarded. In our, in our training and hundreds of them being able to complete even to certify, we had nearly 120 certifications when we begin when we began that project, so from 100 to 700, it's a huge. It's a huge and we also So that kind of change in how training. was being. Misunderstood because training was that mandatory training, everything the HR wanted people to do and your manager will go after you if you didn't uh complete your training during that period. And we started seeing more people going together and discussing about how to get the best from the tooling that we are doing, uh, we are, we are giving to them, and start seeing that that that complete tooling being used in other use cases that special teams wanted more advanced classes. ILT classes classrooms because something in the in the in their path was not covered and they really wanted that er for their day to day day to day jobs so. It really changed the way that uh. We manage training throughout. The last 2, the last 2 years. And As I was saying, uh. It was 3 years ago, some of our executives were coming back from reinvent to Brazil. And they. Just start saying, why don't we try to organize. An experience like reinvent. They are in Brazil, so we partnered with AWS and other and another uh partners of us and and we started reinvent which uh AWS uh Santander AWS experience which, uh, what I'm saying it itplowed the way that we thought about training because uh. We have 2021 nelais, uh Last, last time in October. We got 21 talks level 200 level 300, as we have lots of people trained, we don't, we didn't have to have 100 sessions. We tried to push to raise the bar and have more quality, quality paths. We have different paths. We have AI path, we have databases paths, architecture, so. I cannot say it's the same as reinvent because there are lots of things together, but we have 3 to 4 different, uh, talks at the same time. We also this year we also got the jeep racer inside our in the middle of our open space, so the teams, uh, that, uh, that won the for the final got a lot of public uh throughout the the office because everybody was in the same building, so, uh, you know. We also got escape rooms and escape uh exam preparations through the 3 days, so escape room is usually digital. We got everybody in the same room and tried to get together, uh, to go to to to manage to exit the, uh, we made some jokes about that we're going to close the close the, the door and they are only going out if they can, you can really finish the, the challenge. So what I'm saying is, and, and in the end we also got a big party, but I said the, the people that were certified are the ones that go in the VIP session. It was in the middle of the, in the middle of the party, so they have different things, different booths, whatever. Whatever we thought about having people gamify things. Without having to create a leader board because if you are usually in a gamification program, only the ones that are in the front are really engaged. We get in the middle and get in the end, you lose them. We wanted everybody on board, so that's what even in the last day if you got certified, you go there with your certification, even if it's not in the system, people got the t-shirt and go into the into the party. And that gives us something like this. As more people got trained, cloud and AI. Uh, we can do things. In an easy way that they wouldn't before, uh, so we got a problem inside our investment advi advising, uh, organization. They got stuck trying to have the correct pitch for our customers. They spend more time preparing the conversation than having that conversation with our customers, so. We helped also with help of AWS and we got some stack. We use AWS stack to get everything together. But we transform, change completely the way our advisors works. Now they spend nearly 30 seconds to 1 minute to prepare that pitch because we got everything prepared for them in our knowledge base. So all the products of the bank are cut out there with the relative uh returns, risks, whatever, and they can adapt the pitch for more depth conversation for that kind of client. For other clients, it's a not so deep conversation and we need a more formal approach so they can tune. Many things in the project. And the results you can see it over there and I'm passing through all, all the results, but we increased nearly 1.2 times increasing customer contact and, and not only that, that it's uh it's just a project, but it was our first initiative that went through, you know, a compressed space of time. We experimented it, we launched it. And changed completely the way our one of our Main areas of growth in in Brazil is is using their time, so, uh, trying to wrap up everything. Uh, we truly believe that there's a transition to a new way of training inside companies, especially big ones that are more. Mandate based. tradition of uh dealing with, uh, learning. We believe that lifelong learning is here. To be here forever, um, but I, we also recognize that our team was not ready for a self-based, I, I, I don't know if sometime they will be ready for a full self-based, uh, experience, so that was our way of. Mixing some things from the past like uh we are 180 years history bank with top notch uh technology like SkillBuilder to be able to uh have everything together and I'm gonna say so I will. Thank you Mesh for uh having the time to share our our story and I. I give the word to you. Thank you so much, um, Julio. Uh, what an amazing story. Like, just look at, look at how. A project, uh, and then look at some of the outcomes both in terms of their learning and how they accomplish the skills but also how they applied those skills in a production context within their business applications so super exciting story. I wanna thank, um, Julio for, for joining me on on stage today. So we're towards the end of our presentation, um, somewhere another 2 more minutes and then we're happy to basically take questions, um, in terms of next steps. Here for individuals you have access to over 1000 learning resources uh for individuals you can go to Skillbuilder. AWS.

Uh, to kind of, um, talk about the shift, we talked about the challenges, the opportunity in front of us. We also talked about the shift in learning continues being much more of not no longer nice to have, but much more of a requirement given how quickly the technology is evolving and then the product set, um, that we're building and customers like like Santander are able to use and personalize it to their needs. Uh, so hopefully the session was helpful. Please, um, leave us a feed, leave us some feedback. Uh, we're happy to take questions.
