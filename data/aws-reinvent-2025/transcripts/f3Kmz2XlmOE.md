All right. Welcome everybody. Appreciate you joining us this afternoon. I want to start with making a bold claim. Each of us here share something fundamental, and it's not the fact that we decided to spend the last week after Thanksgiving here in Las Vegas learning about exciting technology coming out of AWS. It's the fact that every single one of us at some point in our lives will be a patient in the health system, and some of us are caregivers for those who are. And if I asked you to think of a moment when you had a frustrating experience trying to navigate care, whether it be trying to figure out the right person to see, when you could be seen, or just having to repeat information multiple times, I'd venture to guess you could come up with one or maybe two different occasions. My name is Chris Rollo. I'm a product leader in AWS, and I'm excited today to talk to you about how we're reimagining patient engagement with Amazon Connect. Today I'm joined by our customer Katrina Bidwell, operations director at UC San Diego Health, and John Appease, senior solution architect at AWS. Now over the past year we've been hearing remarkably consistent themes as we've spoken to health systems across the country and UC San Diego Health has been one of the teams leaning in to explore new ways to address these challenges. Oh, OK. There we go. So over the past year these conversations have revealed some pretty obvious things. Patients want to get help, and health systems want to deliver that help, but the path between these two is becoming increasingly complex. Patients are left to navigate complex systems on their own, who to call, what's covered, when they can be seen, and it results in friction for patients and operational strain for health systems. In fact, nearly 60% of patients consider switching their provider every year, and by far and away the single largest driving factor is a frustrating experience in navigating that care experience itself. Nearly 9 out of 10 patients point to that as being the primary reason they might switch providers. So it points out something quite important here, and that's delivering care isn't nearly enough. It's not enough if patients can't actually figure out where to reach that care. Now across health systems we've noticed something that patient expectations around the experience they receive is increasing and it's matching that what they find in the rest of their digital lives. So the health system that begin to invest in making that navigation more seamless and more efficient for them, they're not just improving patient satisfaction, they're actually building trust, loyalty, and efficiency across the patient journey. So if this is such a big problem, why is it so hard for health systems to solve? So over the past year we set out to understand that and what we've heard has been remarkably consistent. Three key challenges have come up again and again, and the first one is probably the most obvious. The sheer volume and burden and cost associated with managing these patient interactions is unsustainable. It's typical for our health systems to manage more than a million patient interactions in a year, spread across clinics, specialty, and administrative departments, and they're often doing it with legacy systems, manual workflows, and limited staff capacity. Now in some cases we've heard more than 50% of all calls don't even land in the contact center but land in the clinics themselves. And these individuals are manually piecing together information on who they on, on what the patient is looking for, where the call needs to get routed, or even providing basic hospital information. The fact is it's repetitive, it's time consuming, and it's costly, and across the industry overall, these inefficiencies lead to missed appointments, lost referrals, and cost the health system tens of billions of dollars a year. And so the result is mounting strain. It's growing volumes and rising costs and limited ability to scale, and this is even as those patient expectations are increasing. And the second challenge we consistently hear is about fragmented data. Information about patients, appointments, and communication is spread across different tools and systems. And within a single health system it's common for departments each to have their own process for managing workflows whether it be scheduling, medication refills, reminders, or authorizations, each running different administrative or clinical systems. Often the contact center agents can't see what's happening in the clinics and the clinics can't see what's happening in the contact centers, and so that leads to redundant data entry, duplicative outreach, and patients having to repeat themselves at every single step of the journey. And this results in a fragmented experience and importantly, it's not because people aren't trying, it's because the tools don't talk to each other, and it makes it extremely difficult to deliver that seamless experience that patients are now expecting. Now the teams do find workarounds, but often times that burden doesn't go away, it just falls to the human actually completing the job. We've talked to Leaders across the health systems and what they've pointed out to us is that their teams are spending more time navigating and piecing together information rather than actually engaging with patients and delivering care. Now the 3rd challenge is probably the most frustrating. It's that many health systems have actually begun to make investments in technology to address these very problems, but in most cases or many cases, the investments have actually added complexity, not actually solved it. And so over the past few years, many have begun to put point solutions into place to address very specific needs whether it be scheduling or outreach or medication refills, each with its own vendor vendor, each with its own interface and each with its own set of maintenance requirements. And so instead of helping this they're actually adding cost. Complexity, extending timelines and creating more workflows for people to have to follow and use, we've seen health systems spend 12 to 24 months and millions of dollars in investments in these capabilities only to end up with disconnected workflows, overlapping capabilities, and very limited ROI. And so what's important now is we're hearing from health systems is they don't need more point solutions. What they need are more unified systems and solutions that will help them deliver a more unified experience and better, better way to manage the engagement with patients across the, the, the care of continuum, the continuum of care. And that's a shift we've been working towards, and that's exactly where Amazon Connect comes in. So Amazon Connect is AWS's cloud-based contact center service. It's used by tens of thousands of customers and 40% of the Fortune 500 companies. Each day it supports more than 15 million interactions across voice, messaging, and digital channels. And what makes Kinect unique, it's not just its technology, it's what its customers trusted to handle the most critical conversations. And increasingly we're seeing health systems expand what they use Connect for, bringing more of their, bringing more of their patient interactions onto the service. And what's become clear is this when the contact center is already handling more and more of these patient interactions, it stops being just a contact center and it becomes that front door to care, and we're beginning to see that shift. It's not everywhere, it's not all at once, but it's a signal of momentum. Health systems are starting to rethink patient engagement from a single event or a single call into something that stretches across the entire care journey and so that raises a very important question. If the contact center is the front door to care, what else can it enable across the journey? So as we look across the care journey journey, Amazon Connect today can support anything end to end from registration, scheduling to pre-visit and post-visit follow-up. In fact, we're seeing health systems and customers begin to adopt it to handle its inbound calls, automate reminders, and support outreach after care has been delivered in person. And what's emerging is that Connect isn't just managing moments, it's becoming that common engagement layer across health systems, whether a patient is confirming an appointment, checking coverage, or receiving a reminder, those interactions can all flow through the same service, one that's intelligent, one that's secure, and most importantly one that is connected to the source of truth behind the scenes, the health system's electronic health record, and this marks an important shift from the fragmented landscape of today. And when Connect becomes that shared layer, it not only simplifies operations, but it improves consistency and delivers a more seamless experience that patients come to expect. But what we've heard from customers is that while Knect is powerful and can deliver all these different experiences, they want something simpler and easier to adopt to deliver that end to end experience. And that brings us to today. We're making that journey easier with purpose-built AI agents in connect that are designed for healthcare, leveraging real-time integration with Epic's electronic health record system, and the goal here is not just about adding AI, it's about automating routine tasks, unifying interactions, and giving patients more seamless control over their care journey. And it's more about efficiency. It's more than just about efficiency here today. Patients have to restart this process every single time that they engage with a new point in the health system. But with Connect, A agents can maintain that context across interactions so that the customer, the patients are having one seamless connected conversation as opposed to starting over every single step of the way. Now, and just as important, this gives patients more control whether they're checking an appointment, asking a question, or seeking the right resource. They can do this through natural conversational AI. That makes it faster to engage without hold times or multiple transfers. And so taken together, these agentic capabilities represent the next step in how Connect is evolving for healthcare. And the goal is not just to reduce friction but to scale operations, restore capacity, and make every interaction feel more personal. And we prioritize a suite of AI agentic AI capabilities to help healthcare providers solve some of the most high volume use cases they are facing. Taken together, these agentic capabilities can reason through complex multi-step workflows from provider discovery through to appointment confirmation, and throughout their entire journey, they have the ability to act, adapt and make intelligent decisions on when to escalate to human staff. Now from from the patient and caregiver self-identification, this enables the ability for callers to securely identify and verify themselves within the call flow against their personal health information that's sitting in the electronic health record that is epic to an appointment management agent that allows patients to seamlessly manage their scheduling and rescheduling appointments using natural conversational tones. This first party Amazon Connect AI agent finds suitable providers. It checks insurance eligibility, and even incorporates personal preference on time of day, day of week appointment options here. So this this capability here eliminates the need for patients to sit on hold, offering 24/7 ability to manage their appointments, and most importantly, throughout each one of these experiences here we've built guardrails into that such that if at any point in the conversation a patient utters a medical concern, is frustrated with the conversation, or merely wants to talk to a human agent. We can package up that entire conversation with intent and transfer that over to a human agent so they can pick that conversation up right where it left off and the patient doesn't need to repeat anything else. And lastly, we've introduced the ability for patients to look up their existing appointment and make that determination as to whether they want to make changes. Next we're gonna hear from Katrina Bidwell, the operations director at UC San Diego Health, about how they've been working to implement these capabilities and some of the results they've seen. Come on. Hi everybody. Thanks. All right, my name's Katrina. Like the hurricane. I'm here to talk a little bit about what we've been doing at UC San Diego Health. Before I get started, how many of you show of hands are health care practitioners, so you work for a hospital, health system, clinic system. Excellent, great, good to hear. Alright, so this is the boring part for all of you a little bit about us. We are the only academic health center in San Diego County and really south of, um, Irvine, Los Angeles area. Um, we have several locations across Southern California. You can see our beautiful map from the very north of San Diego County just bumping up against Riverside all the way to the South County and almost to the border. Um, our mission is to deliver outstanding patient care through commitment, community, and groundbreaking research and inspired teaching. We are an academic system, so it's very much about the learning and also delivering quality care to our community, our patients, our neighbors, our partners. Our vision is to create a healthier world, one life at a time, through new science, new medicine, and new cures, and we're doing great. All right, so I have to go through this slide with you guys. We are US News and World Report, uh, ranked number 1 in San Diego for 6 years in a row. I believe this is year 6, and, um, top 20 in the nation for multiple specialties cancer, cardiology, heart and vascular, GI, geriatrics, neurosurgery. We have the nation's, um, destination for acoustic neuroma for all my healthcare geeks out there. Um, OBGYN, ortho POM, and neurology. So a lot, a lot, a lot, right? Um, almost 14,000 in the health system. Um, we currently have 3 hospitals. We just purchased, um, a community hospital about a year and a half ago, it seems like 10 years ago. Um, and we have our two main campuses and now the East Campus, which is our third. We also are entering into a joint powers agreement to acquire another community hospital in San Diego to expand our reach to the community again, thinking about our mission and vision. Um, a little over 1100 licensed beds, 36,000 annual admissions, and about 1.2 million discharged. We're responsible for a little over 3.2 million lives within our community. So Care navigation, I had the pleasure of leading care navigation for the institution. We have approximately 45 contact centers. That's not great. Where are my contact center people? Yeah, you, you can imagine what that's like, um, working to continue to consolidate for sure about 750, um, navigators and contact center agents and a little over 3.2 million calls annually, so really, really lines up nicely with the number of lives, interestingly enough. Um, we handle triage, pharmacy, surgical scheduling, perioperative services, and a lot more. It's not just scheduling, a lot of messaging, a lot of back and forth for those of you in healthcare, you know that whole failure cycle of patient calls. One important thing and really my mission and goal is to meet my patient where they are. And I want to ensure that they have the ability to connect with us and the modality that's most comfortable for them, um, so that kind of brings us into our connect journey just a little bit. So we meet them where we are, where they are, and we want to ensure that all the non-face to face care is just as compassionate and caring as the care they're receiving at the bedside in the hospital or in the clinic. Boy, did we have some challenges. Um, again, my contact center people will definitely understand this. We had a phone system that was very much last century. Our chief technology officer often says, um, healthcare is where tech comes to die, and then we revive it. Um, we had a complete lack of visibility and analytics and really we couldn't look at more than call volume. We, we just didn't have any business intelligence with our system. Um, the reliability, we won't mention our, um, former on-prem system, but let's just say it was not 5 nights, um, and disaster recovery business continuity was not an option when we were there. That's a little bit about how I got into the connect journey. Was a DRBC system for those of you who understand that so um that that started our journey scalability oh my goodness, we could not scale for anything. We were literally a 1980s contact center just hoping to get those calls for all those poor patients who were standing in line. When you think about the vision and the mission I just talked about, that's really not delivering anything to the community of San Diego and San Diego and South Riverside County, right? Not at all, um. So you know, we wanted to be able to easily scale up and scale down contact centers as needs arise. Those of you in healthcare or any other type of contact center know you're gonna have a C-suite executive who comes to you and says, hey. I need you to open up some phone lines for X and Y and Z. Anthem's going out of contract. Open enrollment is happening. Can we have a special line just for doctors? That was absolutely something I could not do or could not do easily, right, with our other system. I, I mentioned downtime and availability, scalability constraints, and then financial pressures. Healthcare is bleeding right now. We're one of the few industries in the nation. Where we're negotiating lower and lower and lower reimbursements from our customers, the insurance companies, right? You've seen it in the news, it's real. We have to get more efficient to ensure we can again provide that quality of care. So cost is big for us, um, efficiency is big for us because that helps with cost and the services and the solutions that we were looking at were just too cost prohibitive. So, why connect? Well, Connects solving a lot of my problems. Um, right now I have 99.9, we'll call it 99.95%, but it really has been performing at 5.9's reliability and for contact center that's an important thing for a contact center in healthcare, it's critical when patients need to call me, when patients need to connect with us, whether it's a triage nurse or maybe some of the clinical areas. I can't have phone systems going down. We don't have the ability just to get that rotary phone out of the back closet, although it probably exists there knowing that the tech goes there to die, right? I've got to have a reliable system. I have to have a scalable system. I have to have a solid system, so Connect is really solving my reliability problem and the folks here will tell you that was one of the first things I asked about when we started our conversation and our journey analytics. Analytics are very important. I don't know if you caught the numbers, but 3.2 million conversations are happening in our institution. That's a lot of wonderful data, right? About how our patients think, how they feel, why they're calling, where their challenges are. We don't have, we did not have the bandwidth in our old legacy system to have folks listen to every single one of those 3.2 million calls. How am I going to data mine that information? Well, with Connect, I have a solution now, and it's phenomenal, solved a wonderful problem for me. And I'm thinking about infrastructure too, right? Besides just solving my challenges and bringing this contact center and this health system in the into the 21st century, I wanna do more. I want to deliver on that mission for our patients in San Diego and I needed a partner. I needed a solution that was gonna work with me so I could and can and am doing that, um, and then AI and automation, right? um, everyone's talking about it. I am shocked in healthcare. By how quickly the conversations are happening, how quickly everyone is adopting AI from note taking in the clinic, right? AI note taker took off like nobody's business. I think it was the quickest adopted technology since cell phone camera, um, and now AI agents, AI scribe, IDP, all the things, so it was really important to us that we were gonna be able to scale at that level and at that speed. So quickly rolling out and having flexibility was very important as well. OK, so here's some outcomes. We are just getting started. I, I was reflecting back on that this morning and realized that we're not even a full year into our journey and we have done so much we probably need to pause and reflect on that internally. We've already saved over 300,000 staff hours and I know those numbers maybe don't sound super exciting, but I want you to take those and equate those to the cost of a fully benefited FTE. Working one of those hours and then take that to your C-suite executives and show them what you can do. 82% of patients and caregivers are self-verifying, so Chris talked about what we're doing with patient self-authentication. One of the most important things for me to get started, I am literally saving over a minute on every one of those 3.2 million calls, a minute of time. That's a lot that gives back a lot that for some of the areas they won't need to hire more staff they're going to have more capacity for other areas they need to have longer, better, more caring conversations in our cancer center, in our eye institute, and now we're delivering them that ability, my partners, my clinical partners by giving them this gift of the of the technology. Um, we have seen through this, um, self-service identification, we also looked at tracking other metrics because in addition to how many patients were successful at this, right? I wanted to understand what it did to my other contact center metrics. So we've seen a great, um, lift in service level. Our service levels are still not where they need to be. No one in healthcare, I think, is funded for a 2% abandonment rate and an 80% service level right now. But boy are they better. We have seen a huge lift in service levels and reduction in abandonment rate. That's a big metric for healthcare folks. How many people are giving up and hanging up, right? Huge reduction in abandonment rate right off the gate, right after we started. It was amazing, 50%, and we're sustaining that and we're only going to build on that. So really important here that we're just gaining back time, we're gaining back efficiency, and where we need it, we're giving back to the patient and enhancing the patient journey and for me that's one of the most important things. System learnings. Um First of all, agility was really important to me. I made myself a note to be sure to talk about that because my chief operating officer and my CEO literally come to me constantly. Can we do this? Can we do that? How about this? How about that? And it's really wonderful to be able to say yes and not yes but or yes and or hold out my hand for $100,000. Yeah, I can do that. We can do that. This is what it's gonna look like. Um, having the real-time analy analytics and patient intents, I didn't touch on that probably, probably to the extent that I needed to, but John and Chris will handle that, um, for sure. So when the patients call, we're capturing intent. That sounds like the simplest thing in the world, doesn't it? I mean, why are you calling? But we're feeding that up to the agent in a way that they can have a very meaningful, intelligent conversation. They're not asking what I call the creepy questions anymore, you know, birthdays, social. What's the last 4? Do you know your medical record number? You should all know your medical record number, by the way, it makes things go much faster, but um, you're not doing that, and we're able to give the agent a sense of what that call's gonna be like, so we tee them up to give that wonderful memorable service to our patients again thinking about our community and what we're doing to provide care, non-face to face patient care to 3.2 million patients every year. Dependability is really important, right? So. For me, having 24/7 availability, consistent service, and reliable data, I am now in a data-rich environment. I forgot what it was like to be there prior to bringing Connect in. I've had other ACD systems that gave me that, so I, I cannot tell you how much data mining is available, and it's phenomenal because I go into my C-suite executive meetings with my CEO, CEO and COO and say, hey. Did you know that last week? 2000 people said chest pain on a call. We're not managing that well. Let's talk about how we can handle that operationally. Before, I don't know. Um, consistent service agility, we talked about that, just the flexible infrastructure and really quick for me to spin stuff up. The pilot, we did a proof of concept, probably drove my AWS partners crazy with that, but can we do it here and then can we include this other group? But we really needed to understand what this was gonna be, what this was gonna look like, and it was fantastic to be able to, to do that and then to scale. The proof of concept allowed us to work through some nuts and bolts that we needed to work through internally to ensure that we had the most successful integration and with our AWS partners and our implementation partners we were able to do that. So I would say you gotta crawl and walk and then you can run. We're walking really fast right now and I can't wait to do a marathon. And then you know just collaboration, right? If you talk to me at some point or if you have, I'm gonna tell you how wonderful my partners are. They are my team. They are on my team, and I can get a solution from anyone. There are what, 20 people in the expo hall who have agentic AI. I can have solutions from anyone in the country. I need a partner. I want someone who understands my challenges and who understands what it's like to work in healthcare in 2025. And what the challenges we're facing and the care that we need to deliver and the collaboration I get from this team is unbelievable. So what's next? Oh my goodness, we cannot go fast enough. We cannot go fast enough. Um, we are completely expanding on this automation. We just dipped our toe into this. We are, um, in the 2nd week of finishing the rollout throughout the institution for patient authentication, and then we're moving forward with, um, scheduling, rescheduling, canceling all of the things, um, and I cannot do it quickly enough. We're unified, orchestrated and scalable arrangement, um, that truly is really important as well. So when you think about if you took anything away from this, you probably heard me say my strategy, I'm very patient focused as you can tell. I've spent a long time focusing on patients, but I truly want to ensure that I meet those patients where they are with, with the options that they need to engage with us. I don't want them to go to another healthcare system. We have the best health care in San Diego. We are the level one trauma center. We are the destination in Southern California. They need to come to us, but boy do we make it hard. So my digital front door is only going to be wider and better by utilizing these tools by having something so scalable. I'm going to open that door as wide as possible and ensure that everyone in San Diego who needs to come in for care is going to be able to connect with us. Utilizing self-service, utilizing AI, I'm not gonna have to run a 7 by 24 contact center anymore. I'm gonna have digital agents. They're wonderful. They don't require overtime and they work 24 hours a day, so fantastic. Um, we're, I think one of the things we didn't talk about, and I'm making sure that John has enough time, um, we closed a lot of care gaps too by being proactive. We didn't have the ability to do that before. It was just something that got left on the table. Just answering the calls and managing the patients and getting the schedules and doing the triage and all the things now we have the ability to drive some amazing intelligence through the analytics, through what we're talking to patients about, and then utilizing these tools to start closing our care gaps, very, very important to me and to healthcare. Um, I think I mentioned unified orchestra orchestrated and scalable my call center people. I had a solution. WFM from NICE, ACD from they won't be named, um QA from someone else right on and on and on and on. That is just a nightmare to manage. I don't care how good you are and how wonderful your IT department is. Having this one wonderful scalable solution under one umbrella was hugely important to me, right behind my reliability, and now I have the ability to that just takes care of itself. It's fantastic. It's coordinated. It's connected to Epic. I can start solving really real problems and delivering care. I think the last thing um probably wanna say is at UCSD we have something called leading the way. And we're very proud of that leading the way in healthcare, leading the way in our community, leading the way with each other, and I'd like to think that now we're leading the way with technology and healthcare, with AI, with contact centers, we want to continue to be at the forefront. We want to continue to be progressive. We want to continue to be innovative and most importantly, we want to ensure that we're delivering all of those wonderful outcomes to our patients because frankly they just deserve it. Um All righty. So, I think now is my cue to turn you over to John, who is my wonderful, wonderful partner. Thank you, Katrina. Thanks. OK, let me help you out. job. Hi everybody. Thank you Katrina for for speaking. Uh, so today let's talk about uh what the standard workflow is. Let's talk about what we've built with UC San Diego and let's talk about what we're working on today with UC San Diego. So, like healthcare organizations, we start with the patient first. As patients, we reach out to our healthcare organizations uh to coordinate our care, and it starts with contacting the contact center at your organization. At UCSD, uh, they handle all their engagements with, uh, with their patients using Amazon Connect. So as a patient when we call in, we provide a reason to call. This may be, uh, you may be trying to schedule an appointment, you may be doing something like inquiring about a prescription or, uh, a referral. Maybe you have questions about a particular clinic, or maybe you're just trying to update some record, uh, um, some of your, uh, patient record information. And so In order for a healthcare organization to be able to provide the highest level of care and also protect your privacy, uh, agents will ask you identifying information to verify who you are. This might be date of birth, it might be last four of social, it might be your phone number or medical record number. And so while that's occurring, the agents actually have multiple applications in front of them. They have the agent contact, uh, the agent workspace in front of them, and Epic in this case as the application, the electronic health record system. And so um as you provide that information, um, the agent is identifying your record, uh they're coming up to speed on the reason that you called and they're also verifying your information. And so now that you've provided the information that's required and the agent has verified you, you can now work with them to coordinate your care. OK. So As you're coordinating care during this time, an agent is navigating different screens within Epic. And uh reading through and updating patient records. So for example, you may be looking to uh find out information about your next appointment. And so at that time the agent is checking the upcoming appointments and giving you information about the clinic that the appointment's at, the date and time, the physician that's that you're scheduled with, or maybe you have a situation where you wanna schedule an appointment, right? And so the agent works to gather information about your preferences, right? This might be like the clinic that you want to go to the particular physician you'd like to see the date and time that works for you. And so all, all while checking the clinic schedules and making sure that the appropriate physician you wanna see is available, or you may want to schedule uh multiple appointments, right? And in the case, the agents actually working with multiple schedules across multiple clinics uh with multiple providers. And so these types of interactions uh between patients and healthcare organizations are repeated day in and day out. And at UC San Diego, the average call time for for these types of interactions or average handle time is 5 to 10 minutes. At scale This is calls that are 5 to 10 minutes times thousands of calls per day, right, in any given year. And so at UC San Diego Health, as Katrina mentioned earlier, their constant call center, uh, roughly takes about 3.2 million calls per year. All these calls have different levels of complexity. So let's take those calls and let's divide those up into two different categories. Here we have the specialized or personalized care scenarios versus routine care scenarios, right? So, special uh specialized uh personalized care scenarios, uh, those, uh, those situations require knowledge, right? They require more expertise for you, for you to be able to work with the patient, uh, a specialized focus on the patient need. Um, for example, we talked about scheduling multiple appointments. Um, we can think about maybe scheduling a surgery, right? Uh, first surgery you have to schedule a, a pre-op visit, then you have to schedule the surgery, then schedule the resources from anesthesiology, for example, and then schedule the post-op and follow-up appointments. And so during that time there's a lot of coordination with scheduling that's going on with the agents. Um, or you may have a case where a patient is scheduling, uh, a cancer appointment, right? It might be the first time scheduling an appointment and so the patient may need time to talk through and understand what the process is like. So these coordinations of care require more specialized focus with patients to help them work through complex or even difficult situations. And so then we have uh routine care scenarios, right? These include tasks like patient verification which Katrina mentioned we're working her on, and then appointment information uh you might need as a patient. This might include things like uh scheduling or rescheduling appointments or canceling appointments. These all have defined requirements, uh, like for example, pre-screening questions for certain appointment types. Uh, you have patient preferences for a physician or uh preferred schedules. And so, uh, earlier this year at UC San Diego, uh, we worked with them to address uh routine tasks of patient verification and getting patient information. So today there are thousands of patients like Katrina mentioned earlier that are actually leveraging the patient verification self-service capabilities and being able to list their own appointments. So, um, this provides UC San Diego's patients with self-service capabilities that they didn't have previously and on the flip side, UC San Diego sees a decrease in their overall, uh, average call duration or average handle time. Um, on Monday, this, this past Monday, they took 20,000 calls, right? And based on the numbers that we've been seeing, they've been able to save 345 hours of agent time that they, those agents can now use to focus on more personalized and specialized care for their patients. And so to further improve this patient experience and also um increase uh agent productivity, we looked to data uh and so uh using Amazon Connect contact lens and theme detection, UC San Diego was able to identify that 70 to 80% of the calls are around schedule management. And so today What we're working with them on um is we're working to expand on those productivity increases that we've seen by taking uh helping their human agents to focus on value add patient interactions by delegating down those routine tasks to AI agents that can perform complex but routine uh multi-step workflows. This only removes this helps to not only remove burden from the human agents, but it also helps them to address the growing demand for patient self-service capabilities, all while always providing an option for a patient to be able to contact a human agent. So now let's take a little bit of a deeper look into the architecture. So Here we have a patient that's calling into UC San Diego Health where they're receiving a greeting and uh a language options to choose from. And so if the language is Spanish, uh, today we take them straight to the agent. If the language is English, we proceed by asking them if they're a patient or a caregiver. Along the way, if there are any inputs or session information, we save those and we provide those as part of the context to the human agents and the AI agents as well to help with the patient care coordination. Now we perceive to collect the patient's uh reason for calling or their intent. So as we step through uh further slides of this, you'll see us come back to this place here and work through different examples of this. So if it's a new patient, we route that call to a human agent today so that they can register this patient into the electronic health record system in EPIC. If the, if the patient wants to speak to a human agent. Um, then we start the patient verification process. This is where we collect demographic information such as date of birth, uh, last four of social, uh, or medical record number like Katrina suggested we should definitely be using. Um, organizations typically have a minimum set of demographics that are required in order for you to be able to verify a patient's identity. So when the patient has provided enough information, then we can start to leverage the foundational integration with Epic uh via APIs that are hosted in our healthcare AI services. Uh, built into these foundational services are security controls, uh, for data protection. So we've implemented AWS, a key management service, KMS encryption for data at rest and in transit, uh, and then we also leverage cloud rail, uh, cloud trail logging for that as well. So in real time what we're doing is we're leveraging that Epic uh API integration to search for patient, uh, uh, to search for the patient by patient demographics and once identified we take and we actually retrieve the patient specific information. Uh, we validate that there's a unique, that, uh, unique patient returned, uh, as we know, like there, there are times where you can get multiple patients with the same name or similar information, so we wanna validate that before we return it. And then, uh, then we change the the patient's verification status uh in the flow to verified. From that point Um, the patient has now completed the self-service verification piece of this workflow. The call is then routed to the human agent. When the, uh, when the human agent answers the call, uh, the human agent's workspace displays all the identifiable information. It shows that the patient's been verified. It shows their first and last name. It shows the medical record number, the demographics that they provided during the call, and it also provides additional patient information that's been retrieved from Epic. So now that we've kind of walked through the self-service verification process piece, let's look at a different self-service action that we can take. So going back to the intents here. The patient has stated that they would like to look at their appointment information. And so we again collected demographics we searched for identified and verified the patient leveraging the real-time integration with Epic. Here we proceed to UC San Diego Health's flows and modules that handle clinic specific uh customizations. This is also where our AI agents live. Now we proceed to leverage the secure EPI integration. And in real time retrieve the next 3 appointments over the last over the next 90 days and read that back to the patient. Once a patient has received that information, they have the ability to either end the call or choose another option like speak to an agent. The human agent is presented with the same verification state and patient information retrieved from the patient uh verification process. And so they're able to continue the coordination of care from there with all the appropriate information. And so, so far we've gone over like the standard human to human workflow we've talked about what we've put in place with UC San Diego earlier this year with patient verification and listing information. And so now let's look at uh what we're working with UC San Diego Health on today to address the schedule management piece. So starting back at the beginning at collection collecting the patient intent, the patient has now stated that they want to schedule a new appointment. Then we proceed to the verification process, right, uh, and once verified, we proceed to flows and modules within Connect, uh, to manage clinic-specific interactions with the AI agents. First we, uh, we determine the appointment type and then we, uh, run through a set of, uh, pre-screening questions like, for example, do you have flu-like symptoms? Uh, do you, have you had a fever or a cough in the last 14 days? Once we've gathered that information, then using natural voice conversation, the patient works with the scheduling AI, uh, AI agent to schedule the appointment. The scheduling AI agent helps to find the suitable provider for the patient. It can do things like do, uh, insurance eligibility. It understands the, uh, patient's preferences, uh, like the time of day, scheduling needs, the the specific provider they like to work with. And so once the patient has provided those preferences, The scheduling AI agent uh uses tooling, uh, specifically, uh, model context protocol tools. It's an agent and it has access to tools to do this, and it does, uh, it uses tooling to leverage the Epic API integration. In real time, uh, it reaches out to check for available appointments based on the patient preference. It then retrieves the available appointments and shares them with the patient. Once a patient makes a selection and confirms that particular appointment, The scheduling AI uses tooling again to leverage the epic API integration to schedule the appointment. And so it also uh provides the patient with information like arrival times. Normally when you schedule an appointment you, you hear you should arrive 15 minutes before, 20 minutes before the agent's able to provide that information back. Also physical address, right? Where are you going for your for your particular visit? And then as we've seen in the rest of the work flows, uh, when the scheduling is complete, the patient is given the option to either end the call or choose another option like speaking to an agent. In this case, uh, the call is routed to an agent, a human agent, uh, for additional assistance. And the important thing that I've, I've tried to, uh, iterate many times during this, uh, last few slides is that the the the patient always has the capability of interacting with a human agent at any time. And the important part there is they are able to do that with a warm handoff between the AI agents and the human agents. OK. So now let's look at a demo. The situation is that uh the patient has called in, they've been verified, they've gone through the pre-screening questions, and now they're proceeding with the schedule, uh, proceeding with actually scheduling their appointment. Great, let's get to scheduling. This will just take about 5 minutes or so. I see you've seen Doctor Williams and Doctor Smith for your annual physical exams. Which doctor would you like to see for this visit? Hmm, I'd like to see Doctor Williams this time. All right, thank you. And one last question about your insurance. Are you still insured with Blue Cross Blue Shield member ID ending in 4718? Yes, that's correct. Sounds good. I see you typically visit us on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. Would those times work well for you, or would you like to explore other options? Hm, I want Tuesday afternoon. Between 1 and 4 would work the best. All right, I found three options for you. The soonest is Tuesday, May 10th at 1:15 p.m. There's another on Tuesday, May 17th at 3:30 p.m. And the last option is Tuesday, May 24th at 2:45 p.m. Would any of those work for you? The one next Tuesday sounds perfect. No. OK. And so we've talked about uh making it easier for healthcare organizations to use AI agents. We've talked about uh automating routine tasks, unifying patient interactions, and also giving back more control to the patients over their care. The next step is putting this vision into action. So today at Reinvent, we're launching new AI voice agents purpose built for healthcare, uh, focused on the most common and time consuming areas for both patients and staff. So we're starting by, uh, in this preview with appointment management levering patient verification and epic integration. This conversational agent uh can greet patients naturally. It can handle calls, uh, uh, scheduling and rescheduling through simple dialogue, uh, no menus, no waiting, uh, no transfers, and they can reason through all your preferences as a patient, right? like time of day, provider, and clinic location, and it can do so by leveraging securely, uh, and securely accessing relevant data from, uh, through our Epic integration. So I'd like to thank you very much for coming today. I'd also like to again thank Katrina, uh, for, for coming here and actually presenting. Uh, it's definitely a pleasure to see her up on stage. Um, we will be doing Q&A after this. Uh, we'll be probably taking it off to the back here of, uh, off stage, uh, so definitely welcome, uh, welcome you to come speak with us if you have questions about the process. Thank you for your time.
