Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Almost the end of the conference. It's uh how's everyone doing? Uh, still surviving, uh. All right, you know, so today in this session, we're gonna talk about harness, who harness is, what we do. Uh, and we have, will, uh, have a fireside chat, uh, with Marriott, one of the customers of Harness, and how Marriott has transformed their DevOps and their software engineering, uh, using Harness. So I'll, I'll start with, uh, you know, uh, introducing Who Harness is, uh, our mission in harness that we have all the developers, software engineers in the world writing a lot of code, writing much more code now with AI. How do we enable them to ship all that code very quickly, reliably, uh, efficiently, uh, and securely. And but if you look at like, you know, what's happening with AI, it's the biggest, uh, conversation everywhere in the world of software engineering is AI. Uh, a lot of the focus is AI on coding, uh, and everyone has adopted in one way or another. Uh, everyone is using it either through your business, you're using it personally, white coding, uh, AI agents for coding, uh, which is really powerful. But if you look at these numbers from, uh, from Google's Dora Research, 25% increase in code volume, uh, using AI. But there is a 7.2% decrease in the in the in the delivery stability and 1.5% decrease in the delivery throughput. So why, why is that happening? Like you're writing more code. Everyone would think, you know, if you write more code, you're gonna ship much more code, uh, but that's not really happening. A big part of that is coding is not everything, uh, you know, that you do as software engineering. The inner loop of software engineering that you spec something and you write code, that's only the 1st 30-40% of the time that the engineering team will do. Then you give it to the outer loop, you know, when it goes out of the developer's laptop, that's at least 60-70% of the time, uh, that you spend doing all kinds of things from, you know, testing, securing, deploying, optimizing. And if you look at in those buckets, the testing, securing deploying, optimize, there's so many workflows you have to do. Like if you just look at testing, unit testing, integration testing, load testing, resiliency testing, API testing, UI testing. If you look at your security, you have the code security scans, API security scans, supply chains scans, audit approvals, governance approvals. Checks if you look at what you have to do for deployment, code deployment, feature flags, database deployments, infrastructure, infrastructure as code, infrastructure changes, artifact management, you know, and then you have to optimize it all the cost of the cloud, cost of AI, cost of data, you know, cost of your, you know, your teams and processes. That's where a lot of the software engineering time goes, 60 to 70% of the time. You know, you see, you saw all these, you know, workflows that historically have been a big painful process for people to do, like, you know, everything, these 30 plus complex workflows. With AI, the, the code volume is going up. There's 4X more code volume there, you know, in many companies, you know, you see 20 to 25% pretty often, uh, but we're gonna very soon be in at least in 4X. But if you don't have the downstream outer loop optimized, we don't, we're not going to get the throughput out of it. And that's where if you look at the testing processes, a lot of manual steps. The security is mostly siloed away from DevOps and the deployment systems. Deployments are mostly still written through scripting. People, you take your CI from the old kind of CIs and add deployment scripting on top of it and optimization. A lot of people still have a lot of inefficiencies you see everywhere from cloud costs, all kinds of costs that are happening everywhere. That's what Harness is looking to solve. Harness is a platform for software delivery and bringing AI and automation to the entire software delivery process. So Harness is built of many modules, modules to help you through all of that process. So you use AI to help write code better, code faster, and be much more efficient in coding. And harness becomes the automation and AI solution to help you after that, which is, you know, increase your velocity, next generation CICD, uh, you know, next generation infrastructure as code, uh, database DevOps, artifact registry, you know, cloud developer environments, all kinds of things that you need to do to modernize your DevOps practices that you know, so that you can. Ship the code really, really fast, uh, you know, all the software for uh for you know for reliability to increase the reliability whether it's feature flags and future experimentation, uh, chaos engineering, AI SRE, uh, you know, AI test automation so you can replace your selenium and playwrights and all those kind of scripting with with AI agents are doing the testing. Uh, security work, uh, a lot of the app security, uh, work that you have to do on code security scans, API security, supply chain security, and then, you know, uh, optimizing it all, you know, from your cloud cost, and then you, you have the, uh, the engineering metrics, uh, you know, to, uh, uh, to understand where the inefficiencies are, uh, you know, where, where in your engineering processes, where the cost inefficiencies are, so you can, you can, you can increase that. So harness platform, you know, it's a platform of all of these capabilities our customer. will normally pick and choose where they want to start with. Most of our customers start by modernizing their CICD, uh, you know, replacing the old CICD system so you can have fully, fully automated process of, uh, of, you know, code, developer rights code, and every, every, every, every check, every test, every control, every, uh, you know, check and balance is all fully automated in the CICD pipelines, you know, then you, then our customers start adding, you know, security testing, resilience testing. Testing finops, uh, all kinds of other practices in these modern pipelines so you can have a fully automated process, uh, uh, you know, and get significant productivity boost, uh, boost of, uh, by in, in doing this. All of this, uh, uh, uses an underlying AI foundation, you know, this, which is, uh, uh, you know, built of a few areas, you know, number one is the AI agents, uh, so we have a whole library of AI agents from, uh, to do all these tasks, AI agents to do DevOps tasks, you know, create CICD pipelines, you know, troubleshoot. Deployment failure, a build failure, you know, set up policies around our governance policies, templates, you know, release agents to make sure like you know you can have the future experiments and the future releases and the rollouts set up properly, reliability testing, you know, UI testing, security. So these agents are doing all the all the work that you would do normally through a lot of manual dev ops kind of work to set up, set up your set up your STLC practices. But the agents are, you know, as I'm sure in the, the whole conference you've heard about a lot about the context, uh, engineering, um, but that's a, uh, that's a very important part of, uh, what we provide like that's the your businesses, your enterprises have a lot of context, context around like, you know, uh, how your services work. How your environments work, which infrastructure you're running on, what your security policies are, what tests you do, how your team structure look like. There are all kinds of things that you have to do, uh, uh, uh, uh, you know, always, and that's what we're capturing in, in a knowledge graph that we, we understand the knowledge graph of, of, of, uh, any organization, any software engineering team, where all the things are, and that knowledge graph is the context that, you know, how the AI agents will use to, to do something. So for example, if we go to our AI, say create me a CICD pipeline for, you know, my deployment. Now it's like, you know, if you, if you just create a generic stuff like if you go to chat GPD you're gonna see a generic some answers there. That's not useful for any organization, any enterprise. So that's where the context comes in. Like, you know, in the context we understand like what does it mean? What does your deployment policies mean? What are your templates, what your security controls are, what infrastructure you're running on, what are your requirements that you need to, to run there, you know, how, uh, where, where things are connected with each other, what secret systems you use, all of that's, you know, part of the context that we'll, that we'll use to, to set up things. And then we have the underlying orchestration layer, uh, you know, these, everything. The AI agents are doing the orchestration layer is still, you know, could still be deterministic around it so you can control what you want AI agents to do. You want AI agents to go and do a deployment in production, or you want for them to create a pipeline that will more deterministically do a deployment in production. So you have the full, full spectrum of how much control AI takes over and how much, you know, your, your deterministic automation takes over, and that's what you know will allow you to do. We have about 1,000+ enterprise customers using harness in, you know, in big ways to solve these problems, uh, you know, you'll see a lot of logos here, you know, a lot of large banks, large technology companies, insurance companies, airlines, you know, hospitality companies, you'll hear from uh from Marriott soon here. And we are doing it at a very large scale. Just in the last 12 months on harness Platform, there were 128 million deployments that happened through Harness Platform. We had 81 million builds that happened through Harness Platform. 11 billion tests we optimized through our AI-based test optimization. $1.2 trillion 1.2 trillion API calls we watched and secured, you know, $14 trillion feature flag evaluations, 5 million security scans, $1.9 billion of cloud. Cost optimized and a lot of people using the, you know, these agents to do, do, do, uh, do these tasks now, uh, so we're very, uh, uh, uh, you know, very proud, uh, that we were able to solve these problems for many organizations and, uh, uh, you're we're recognized, uh, by Gartner and Forrester and as the leaders, uh, you know, in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for DevOps platforms. Harness is a leader, uh, the Forester wave for DevOps platforms. Harness is a leader now. And we have a very strong partnership with AWS, you know, we work very closely with AWS, uh, you know, we, our, our everything that we do with our AI is exposed through a lot of MCP tools in our MCP server, and all of those are integrated in Amazon Quiro and, uh, uh, you know, and, uh, any, any kind of coding systems. We're very, uh, deep partnership with, with, with, with Amazon. Uh, you know, we are deployment ready on AWS, uh, and working very closely with the product teams and the, and the innovation, uh, as we drive our innovation, uh, on our knowledge graphs and our MCPs. So if you are on AWS, which, uh, uh, you know, we can, uh, we, we can definitely help you there. So I'm. Going to invite our field CTO Nick here on the stage to show you a demo of the harness platform so you can see for for real. And once, you know, after the demo we'll have uh you know, uh Adnan and Sean from from Marriott join us and we'll have a conversation on how, how they're using harness. Alright, I'm gonna try to keep this as brief but also hopefully a little bit entertaining, give you some context. I'm gonna show you a lot of what Harness does. I'm not gonna talk about in the modular ways of what we're doing, but we're gonna show you what this could look like, um, just to give you some, some kind of ideas of how this works. I'll show you the AI throughout this entire process because the whole point of this is that removing the worst part of the job, right? If we think about where all the AI has been spent, it's actually been the things we love doing like planning and and then actually like critically thinking and going through these things and developing software, but now let's actually take away the things we hate doing, whether it be, you know, running tests and waiting for them to run or security. So let me walk through what this can look like for you, um, and how easy it is to set up and configure, but also let's talk about. How we make this easy to do the right thing. We want to make sure you have templates that it's very quick and easy to get to production, but also make sure that it's hard to do the wrong things. And I know those are two very basic statements, but we have to put policy in place to make sure we're not skipping steps, we're not combating that security scam on accident. So making sure that we have all of the things so we know what goes into production. Um, what you're looking at right now is a pipeline. It's very specifically designed to go from, uh, we've got a build stage, we're gonna do infrastructure stand up, we're gonna deploy to multiple different environments, and every step of the way you can see exactly what we're doing. So anything that we're doing, it's entirely audited. Every step of the way you can see everything we've executed. You can see the input variables, you can see the output variables. Everything's here for you to know exactly what happened and how it happened. But more importantly, what we really wanna do is we wanna save you that time. So one of the things you'll notice we call out really quickly is that we're saving you about 1819 minutes' worth of time by doing things intelligently. So for instance, if I do a 200 line code change. Right, I don't wanna run all 12,000 unit tests. That wouldn't necessarily make sense because it's a very small change. So Harness now understands exactly what's correlated with the change that you made in the test. So we can go ahead and correlate and understand. Here's the uh the changes that we made, the tests associated with it. So now instead of running all 12,000, I can run about 10% of those. So right there alone saving about 8 minutes by simply running the tests again that are associated with the change, right? If I have new tests, fine, I'll run those, or if they're updated tests, I'll have to run those. I don't know how they're going to respond, so I need to see them. But at the end of the day, again, take care of that pain every single build now we're we're cutting that time away from, from your folks. Another big one, for folks oftentimes is dealing with security vulnerabilities, right? We've got tons of different scanners, so whether they're SCA scanners, or are code scanners, whether they're SAST, right, all the different SAST scanners, um, you know, as you go through infrastructure scanners, so forth, and even container scanners, the issue is that it's very hard, it's very difficult to go and actually get through and find the noise throughout that or find the signal through the noise. And so how do we start prioritizing those? How do we deduplicate those? How do we start actually doing something that's valuable? So one of the things that we can do for you very quickly. Is what we'll do is we'll automatically go and aggregate, normalize, and deduplicate all those vulnerabilities for you. And if it's a code base, so not changing a library, but if there's an actual code change that needs to happen, you know, you don't wanna see all 31 occurrences of this sit inside of your entire environment. We can show you them, but we wanna aggregate it. We wanna know what's valuable to change and then most importantly, I wanna be able to give you an AI response of like how would we go do this. That's fine, but in the reality today, what would happen is somebody would go build me a spreadsheet. I'd take that spreadsheet, I'd turn it into Jira tickets. Those Jira tickets would go into a backlog, and two weeks later, somebody might go fix that critical vulnerability. And instead, why would we do that? Why wouldn't we have Harness just go and understand the lines of code with that knowledge graph that Jyothi talked about? I can know the lines of code, I know the vulnerability. I can actually just go ahead and write you the PR. Here's how you fix it. So you don't have to go through the process and think about it and go through this. These are the things we hate doing. Let's let harness handle that portion for you, so that you can go ahead and again do the things that you love. And So again, this is just in the build phase, right? Just very simple things thinking about things like your best engineers, taking away all the extra work and the toil that we don't wanna go through as this progresses forward, we're gonna build that full bill of materials for you so you can make sure you know what's in that artifact. You're gonna have the attestations to prove this is that same artifact so that you don't have an attack that they're gonna do through your supply chain. We know this is the exact artifact. We know what it's built, right? And so all throughout this process only ever progressing forward, if and only if this actually meets those requirements. Right, so after this one was, uh, we, we did our build, now we're gonna go stand up some infrastructure. And so the benefit here is we're gonna go look at that infrastructure and the neat parts is, is that not only do I wanna go and, and, and make the assumption of like, OK, great, we're gonna do that plan, we're gonna that apply, but what's it gonna cost me? And I can actually go ahead and I can actually look at the estimated costs in that environment and I can go look, hey this is gonna 19x my costs. Maybe I should pause that infrastructure change until someone actually says and approves that so the policy can even be on the cost of what's changing. We wanna bring that information now when it's valuable, not a month later when it's sitting there running in production. Right, as we go through this now, it's we've studied the infrastructure, we've done the build, we've done the infrastructure. Now I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna look at our uh deployments into dev. We're going QA staging and again following that same pipeline, being able to see and and audit every single thing that we've done, it's gonna go through that, making sure it's that same bill of materials that we've got that same salsa check. It's gonna make sure that we're integrating with all of your ticketing systems. So now I'm updating Jira, I'm updating Service now. I'm putting the evidence in the places that are needed so that I don't have to do that collection anymore, right? Again, tasks we don't wanna do. Um, this is gonna go through. This is gonna do that application. It's also gonna make the database change for you, so it's gonna roll out in a way that's meaningful, but also a way that can roll back in the same capacity. So we'll go ahead and roll out those database changes and then ultimately this is just gonna roll out to, to, uh, to, to the dev environment. We'll go do some tests. If it's great, we'll update the tickets, right? And we can see this thing kind of progress through. In QA it's almost the same pipeline, but we're gonna add a whole bunch of tests. So we're gonna go run those tests where our AI can actually go ahead and design and create those tests on the fly. If I move a button and change a button and change a color, I don't wanna go put an X path somewhere. I can have this determine it for me, but I can also run all the resiliency checks throughout the process. So now when we think about. I wanna make sure that I've got enough replicas. I wanna make sure that I can handle an outage. I, I'm gonna keep my order. All of the things that I wanna prevent, I can have those actually running as chaos tests for us and again only ever move forward if it meets those requirements that I have. If it doesn't meet my resiliency requirements, don't worry about it. Pause the pipeline, stop, go fix them, right, so you can continue forward. I'll go to one last one really quickly. I don't wanna spend too much time. Um, and in production we've been doing this for the last 8 years. We, we started doing, uh, we started and we came to the market when we first started as bringing AI to continuous delivery. That was in 2018, so be very clear, it was not generative AI. This was predictive modeling. It was neural networks. It was, uh, machine learning, but it was thinking about deployments like your best engineers. The idea here is that if I'm gonna look at the APM metrics, if I'm gonna look at the logs, like I don't want to have my best engineer. On the phone every time to figure out what that should look like. So the intention very simply, and I'll I'll show it to you, is that as we go through this process, as you'll see, it's gonna go through the production deployment again, checking and validating all the critical vulnerabilities, making sure that this is the same artifact, updating the tickets, rolling through the database changes, doing complex deployments like a canary, but now it's gonna actually go verify and it's gonna look at the things that matter to you. So let me actually go over here. Mhm. Here we go. So. Right now it's gonna look at all the metrics that you care about. So think about your response times, your, your error rates, anything that you would actually consider those golden metrics, any time series metrics, this for even, so some of our customers, it's actually uh revenue generation. So when I do an experiment and I wanna see if an ad's actually giving me uh better results, I can even use revenue as that time series metric. But now I'm gonna go ahead and look at those and have an understanding. This shows me that I'm slow. If I'm slow as an engineer, the first thing I'd do is go look at the logs, right? And, and here's the area that, you know, there are certain known logs that we've got, we've got exceptions that happen, they shouldn't be there. And we'll show those like traditionally we don't highlight them, I'll turn them on so you can see them. But like here's an example like this is a null pointer exception. It should not exist. We know it shouldn't exist. However, it's there every single time we deploy, right? So I, if I'm, if I'm, I've been in the system a long time, I've been with the company, I know, OK, that, that it's OK. It shouldn't be there but it's OK, it's fine. We're in that same kind of concept. So what you actually care about, it's not about, uh, the things that we know about it. So what about those ones that change in frequency and what about that brand new one? Right, that happened for the first time. Those are the signals that we want to get to very quickly, and based on those failures, because Harness knows what you deployed, on which infrastructure, with which configuration, with which database changes, now we can actually get you back to where you were before you started, right? We'll go ahead, we'll kill that canary. Alright, we'll go ahead and roll back that database change and then we'll update the tickets and all of the systems to make sure everyone knows exactly where we're at. We know why we rolled back. We know where the errors are, and you can get to what you need to. The whole point is to solve all of those problems that constantly take us that extra time so we can start focusing on the things that matter to the business. One last quick thing and then I'll, I'll, I'll let the stage go up and, and, and, and what you're actually here for and, and listen to Marriott. Is all of this should be a way that it could be a contribute uh contribution model, right? This is not, uh, someone sitting in an ivory tower building this very strict rigorous template that that's the only way you can get to production. It's, it's made so that you can actually contribute. So even your developers, if they wanna make changes, they can commit, uh, go ahead. You know, give me a PR, we can go and actually merge that and bring it into the system. But so you can do this in the UI. You can do this as configuous code. But the best part about this is that now we can allow security teams, finance teams, they can start running policies that make it very easy for us to do the right thing but very hard for us to do the wrong thing. And so what I mean by that is like, let's take this whiz scan. Oftentimes if you go look at your current CIN CD systems, developers will just go comment out the scan. They'll just, the scan's taking too long, so they'll comment it out, they'll run the build, and then they'll turn it back on. If you don't believe me, go check your PRs. Like it's like there's some people smiling, so trust me, that happens. Um, you can't do that in harness. I just deleted that whiz scan. I said, all right, I don't want it. I'm an admin on this account. I'm a full admin. I'm not even gonna do a PR we're gonna push straight to Maine, but what you'll find very quickly is I can't. Those policies are put in place to make sure we all know the rules of the game that we don't go and do something wrong and and and hinder our business, so it says you can't even save this pipeline because it doesn't have the required security steps that you need to go to production. So again, all of those can be built specifically with the context for your teams, for your organizations, and you can have different setups for the different areas that you have, but the whole point is to make it extremely easy. We want everybody playing by the same rules so we can all go faster. Uh, I know that was a lot in a very short period of time, so but that was a, that was just a very small subset of what we can do, but I wanted to kind of give you some of that AI to show you how it's truly removing that, the worst part of the job for you to help you then go back and do what you love. So thank you. Yeah So I wanted to get you a glimpse of, you know, what, uh Harness does and how it solves these problems. Uh, if you want to reimagine all your DevOps, dev ops, uh, software delivery practices now in the age of AI, like why do you have to do so much developer toil? Why is it all this scripting? Why is, like, you know, it's such a mess, it's, uh, you know, uh, we can help you through that, uh, reimagine it all automated. All, uh, you know, bring AI agents to it, uh, and, uh, simplify the entire process. So you, you'll hear from, uh, from Marriott. Uh, so I'm going to invite, uh, uh, you know, uh, Adnan and Sean, uh, to join us here on the, on, on the stage and, uh, share their journey on how they were able to transform their DevOps and software engineering through, uh, you know, through, through help of harness. Please come on. So let's start by, you know, everyone knows who Marriott is. You know, I'm sure everyone has stayed in Marriott's Hotel, but it'd be great if you can, uh, you know, introduce, uh, you know, each of you, uh, you, you'll do a much better job in that, in doing that. And like, you know, what, uh, what role do you play at, uh, at Marriott? Sure, do you wanna start, Sean? Sure, I'll start. So I'm Sean Corkum, senior director of Devset Ops and Automation. Um, I work within our, our DevOps team and also our internal developer portals to, you know, try to make our developers' lives easier. Uh, I'm Adnan Haq, and, uh, I oversee our infrastructure platforms, all our, uh, global data centers, cloud practice, uh, Devite cops, and, uh, lately service reliability engineering. And you can imagine the Marriott scale. Like, you know, Marriott is not just one brand, it's the, you know, how many properties you have now. Uh, we're approaching 10,000. We, um, we open, including acquisition, we open about a new property every 16 hours. Without acquisition it's about 24 to 36 hours, give or take 130 plus countries, uh, yeah, 143 countries the last time I counted. All right, so the countries are countries are increasing their, uh, all right, so you know, we'll, we'll talk about. Um, transformation when, when any time like someone talks about any kind of transformation starts, OK, what does transformation mean, you know, is it, uh, so for a company like Marriott Olivier, you have like, you know, such a massive number of customers, uh, consumers, so, so much complexity when it comes to technology, modernization, transformation. What does it mean? I think that's a great question, um. So typically it depends on the vantage point of the person that's looking at it, right? For someone in the infras space, perhaps it means looking at cloud adoption. Um, for someone in the application space, perhaps it's moving from monolithic systems to services based architecture. Um, from a business perspective it's about more cross-sell opportunities, more upsell opportunities, higher revenue, right? Um, same thing can be said for the process side. They're looking at processes, how to streamline it, but to me transform transformation is actually all of the above. They all have to happen at the same time. Um, in order for an organization to operate. In a manner that increases its velocity and its ability to roll out its products and services at a faster pace, um, so if you really look at the crux of what enables that, it's moving away from the traditional concepts of blocking governance and bringing in technologies to automate where the default answer is no, you need an approval, the default answer is yes, answer is yes, you're approved. Unless there's a reason not to approve it, right, automate the approval and you know, and the only the failure condition requires an approval, not the normal condition. And when you do that, you actually reduce the cognitive overload, right? Um, you and Nick both talked about toil, uh, and if you look at, um, any of the team members that are trying to build a product, deliver something, a service, you know, easily 30 to 40% of their time in a large enterprise, maybe even higher. Uh, is the cognitive overload of not developing that product or service, but everything else that has to be done, change management, uh, approvals, socialization, funding, managing the budgets, etc. right? And that's where that standardization can actually reduce the cognitive overload and, and that's where we are really excited about harness because that's exactly what it does, that's where it plays. It reduces the cognitive load of our um of our team members so that they can move faster at scale. And that leads us to the definition of modernization. So what, what triggered for you guys, like, uh, OK, let's go ahead and uh. You know, you have old ways of doing things. You know, what's like at some point, like, the frustration from it builds up some for many people it's like, you know, I'm more code coming out with AI or something is we have, we have to move to cloud. We have to do something and let's, let's rethink, you know, why are we slowing down and where the developer toil is. What, what, what was that. Yeah, I, I don't know if there was a single thing, um, I think it, uh, you know, um, what leads an organization to transformation is a series of things that happen, right? When they grow fast, when the processes stop working, uh, when things, when the hidden factories that were created for a purpose at one, at one point are now just running and, and people are are doing things just because that's how it's been done, right? Um, so all of that was happening, um. The catalyst was um. Uh, uh, was COVID, Marriott being a hospitality company, um, our, our biggest challenge was going through COVID when the hotels were literally boarded up. So coming out of it there was a unique opportunity to really rethink, um, the teams were, uh, were reduced, uh, significantly just to keep the lights on. Investments obviously were difficult during that era. Uh, so when we started rebuilding and when the demand actually, um, people talked about all these. V shaped recovery and W shaped and every alphabet, no one talked about an Is shaped recovery. That's what Marriott went through. We shot through the roof. We were trying to shut down our mainframes while we were buying new mainframes, so it was very interesting. So that kind of helped us in uh really reimagining how we want to operate as we move forward. So with the eyes shape recovery, you have no other option. You have to move really, really fast. You have to do everything. You have to keep the lights on. You can't say no to the demand that's coming in. Uh, you have to restart your properties and you have to rethink how you're doing business because the old processes were, were pretty broken at that point. So what's, uh, uh, how did you think about where to start? You said, you know, you're not moving fast enough in your innovation, you know, or the move to digital, um, all the things that you need to do to, you know, in that ice shape recovery. So how did you think about, let's move the break the problems and figure out where to start, yeah, um. So it has to start with a vision. What is the problem that we're trying to solve? That's step number one, but you know, vision can only give you so much. You have to really define it at the right level of success criteria that you wanna achieve, right? Um, and the flexibility that you need to have, uh, to deliver on that vision. So it's, it's all about thinking big but delivering small, right? Um. Looking at areas that had the, the, the largest blast radius and those small levers that could really create big waves, right? and identifying them and prioritizing them and I feel that platforms is one area where you could actually, you know, um, where you can rethink how a platform is operating. We, we actually rethought how infrastructure was, was operating and we went from becoming an infra uh from being an infrastructure team to becoming a platform team, right? And we, uh, we said we're gonna build that once we're gonna standardize it, we're gonna put all the security control governance, everything inside our platform so that our products can inherit it and as a result we're gonna reduce the um the toil and the cognitive load on our engineers who are developing those products so that they don't have to redo it. um. It's also really important to have an agile mindset, and I'm not talking about a framework like safe, uh, scale agile framework. I'm really talking about an agile mindset, being a, uh, having the ability, uh, to change course at any point. When you see that there is a better option, right? We can't live our lives on shortcuts, but we should always keep an eye for a shortcut and if we find it, we should be able to, um, have that agile mindset and not consider that as a weakness or a problem, but. As, as, uh, uh, as an enablement for our teams to make those decisions, right, and move forward, standardization is another area where I feel it's, it's a small, small thing that reaps big results once we have standardized our deployment pipelines, right? Sean and his team standardized the deployment pipelines. Um, that was a pretty big impact because now you've taken that overload, that, that cognitive load from the engineers. Hundreds and thousands of engineers by just building that one pipeline and standardizing it. That's the, that's the platform effect, right? You do it once, uh, you know, the, the move of move from DevOps teams and, uh, infrastructure teams to like you this is the ticket, do something to. Yeah, give a platform where everything's automated, standardized. It's, it's simpler for everyone, absolutely, and that's a big part where harness came in for us too, like being able to provide that, uh, it's rich API systems that then allow us to create other automations and get to the point where developers are not having to look at a bunch of things, not having to have that, you know, tribal knowledge of I have to go talk to this person for this, that person for this, submit a ticket over here. Uh, for us internally, uh, they can go right to our, uh, our IDP we call it the developer's concierge, uh, and that can trigger and build everything right from off the bat. So like, I'm starting a new product, I can just go click I need this at microservice. Sets them up in harness, gets them completely configured, creates their repositories, gets them going, and really keeping your application developers like writing application code is incredibly important and not having to think about all these other things like uh my security and this and that like just. Help take that off their plate and just that one feature that Seann just talked about resulted in our time of about 6 months to build an integrated environment at a cost of roughly $500,000 to 35 minute self-service deployment. Engineers can do it in the middle of the night. Great data point, you know, that's, that is the power of automation and standardization and simplification. Like, you know, that's what I was, you know, when I talk about the impact of AI, you know, this AI for coding and this AI for everything after coding, and the impact of AI for after coding could be some, could be big numbers, and, uh, like, like this. So, you know, thanks for sharing that. So when, when, when you guys looked at, you know, let's go and, uh, create this platform engineering concept and a developer concierge. And you started looking at tools and the the tool chain in in in the market has been like there's all kind of older tool chain, you know, there's next generation solutions like harness. How do you guys, uh, you know, maybe share with the people here, uh, why did you pick harness. So for me, kind of going through things, uh, I've, I've gone through this rodeo before of, of helping a, a, a company kind of modernize the space and one of the big things that I've learned from that that I wish I could go back and redo was the fact that. There's, you need something that you can actually have uh an auditable governance around, um, so like Nick was showing in his demo, you know, engineers will just, oh well that scan's failing. I don't wanna deal with it right now, they'll remove it and a lot of systems make it very difficult, uh, not on purpose, but just because of, you know, how they were initially architected. To kind of uh provide that governance and when it came to harness having OPA big baked right into the platform, now I can easily write a Rego policy that will look across everything and we're able to create these templates at the account level everyone can inherit, but they can add to they can't take out. There's always gonna be little quirks about their individual applications that they'll need something um. But they can't skip any of these processes anymore and we didn't have to spend 8 months writing some custom process to build that governance around a different tool. We had this all right off the bat. Beyond that, harness out of the box for us had significant, uh, advanced capabilities for the deployments like uh Nick had mentioned Canary. Doing Canary is actually a little complicated, uh, and we get it out of the box right there with this. So we were able to go from a system that was firing forget so you don't know if your deployment actually succeeded, but you know it triggered something off to Kubernetes uh to now being able to have it up, make sure it's running, watch it for however long that we want integrated with our APM tools and really make sure it really is doing what we expected and if it's not. Let's go back No harm, no foul to the system. Nobody noticed. Nobody's getting paged at 3 in the morning because of it, uh, and we're all able to, uh, to keep moving along. Harness was the, the only system out there that allowed us to really leapfrog a good 10 years from where we were to where I wanted to get us to in one shot, and that's the definition of. Everything is approved unless it's not right as opposed to nothing is approved unless it is, but that level of automation that harness has given us has really allowed us to implement that principle, right, um, and then there are other areas of course in, in the transformation, but at least from a deployment perspective and, uh, canary releases and feature flags, these are capabilities that are coming out of the box, so. So how do you, how do you convince the dev teams? Like one of the things that we hear quite a lot is, uh, you know, the platform engineering team, the leadership team, very convinced that we gotta modernize, uh, and automate everything, but the dev teams are used to doing certain things like they have CICD systems. They've, they've used for 5 years, 10 years. They've done some ways, and then there's a resistance that you have to overcome. So how did you guys do that? Uh, for us, it, it's Adnan mentioned, we kind of followed that agile mindset within our space. We started small, day one, you know, piloting with harness as we first started, we started dog fooding it ourselves. There were some teams, uh, as, you know, we kept moving forward, some teams that were a little more interested in, in forward thinking, we started engaging with them. They started getting quick wins. So now we've got a couple of teams getting quick wins and now their leadership groups are seeing like, oh well this group's delivering faster and it can start growing organically versus just being like a mandate to, you know, shove down everybody's throat, they start going, oh. I can, I can move faster. I can move safer. I'm not getting paid for things as much. I'm able to focus more on the thing I actually like to do in writing my application and it starts taking off like fire. So if you can build that kind of excitement and get your, your customers quick wins, start showing it, start showing the value. Makes it a lot easier, yeah, you, you have to, you have to get to this roughly 30 to 35%, um, of mindset shift, right? Once you have that, I, I feel the teams build escape velocity, then, then they just have to move forward, right? They continue on and just rinse and repeat, uh, and for us to reach that 35%. Like Sean said, we had to eat our own dog food, so we actually brought in harness to automate the processes within the infrastructure and platforms team. We were still deploying infrastructure, but everything was being done through harness. And once we, once we, uh, figured out all the kinks, worked it out, and it was working stably, that's when we started the self-service with a few teams and we said you can do it any time, you don't have to depend on us and, and, and that one piece where a team doesn't have to depend on someone, an engineer doesn't have to depend on someone. That sells itself, yeah, yeah, and engineer, that's what engineers want. They don't want to depend on someone. They want, like, you know, uh, they don't want to even know about most of those things. That's not their strength. So it's good to, that, you know, what you, what you guys did is what, uh, we see as a successful model because otherwise if you go from top down and say go and replace your things and, uh, people just don't do it. It also helps when you can tell your engineers, I'll have your CI time, yes. Uh, yeah, so yeah, let's talk about that. Like, you know, the, the results and the numbers, uh, and I'm sure like, you know, uh, uh, folks in the audience would love to hear what are the outcomes of all this, uh, what we're able to achieve. So half the build time, yeah, so I mean for us our, our CI time dropped from, you know, roughly 12 minutes on our old platform down to 5, and this guy doesn't know it, but we actually did some tweaks about 2 weeks ago and it's, it's a little lower. We're we're closing in on 4 minutes for CI. Um, and how much was it before, before it, it was 12, it was 12, but the caveat on that was, it was 12 but with less things in it, so moving into harness we've got all of those safeguards and all those extra bits to help start making. Uh, things like auditability being more automated where teams can just go, OK, here's a graph auditor, you got all the information you need versus having to do 1000 things because they only really did like a docker build, maybe didn't even run their tests, who knows? They now all have that, but we still shrunk the amount of time it took. Yeah, the, the 12 to 5 is all the, um, all the tweaks that were made within harness right pre-harness era. Um, I, I think it's, it would be unfair to, to, uh, judge that as a 12 minute deployment because the amount of capabilities that we had using Jenkins were probably half of what we have today. So not only did we double the things that we're doing during deploy deployment checks, balances, whatever, OPA policies, etc. we also reduced the time on top of that, right? So, so the. Uh, the benefit is actually significantly better than what that metric tells from 12 to 5.5 minutes. It doesn't do justice. And then going along with that too, I mean, our, like you mentioned earlier, our, uh, environment provisioning going down from like 6 months to, you know, 35 minutes, 35 minutes tops, sometimes less depending on what they need, uh. And trying to do that level of automation previously with Jenkins was very challenging to say the least. Um, harnesses API system make it, makes it significantly easier for us to be able to work with that and get it going. And uh how, how do the security teams uh respond to this? Are they happy that they are ecstatic that everything is getting scanned now and when they wanna find it and know what's going on, they can see it all and they know everything we're getting, you know, like all the S-bombs, the salsa, all the artifacts signing, all that's actually happening. They're like, thank you, thank you, appreciate it. Yeah, it's, it's, uh, uh, the impact of modernizing, you know, where, where you, you automate security, security is happy and developers are happy because they don't want to be chased by security and, you know, did you run my scan or not and all that stuff, yeah, exactly, yeah, and, and once they know that it's gonna happen automatically. They start removing those governance processes, those oversights, those meetings that you have to go to to get the I approve message from all stakeholders, right, change management meetings, all of that just starts to die on the vine by itself. That's what I like to say like the, the new cabin. The no cab like your your pipeline should be the cab like you know it's like that's everything is in there like why do you need anything else? The automated pipeline should be the cab and you know what it does is it actually reduces a lot of escalations because the number of escalations that came to me, hey, we, we need an approval to move forward because of some. Some fire drill some issue, right? And, and now you're under pressure to approve or be that ass who's gonna say no, go back, fix it you automate it, you kinda remove yourself from the picture, uh, it's the system, you know, as, as a, you know, boss, the, the, the thing that I hate the most is like someone asked me to approve something I don't know what I'm approving. That's a big problem. Like, you know, when you are under the fire, like, you know, I don't under. Should I approve it? Did you do all the right things or not? What's the, what's the proof, uh, and you know that's why you need all the, you know, some process that approving instead of you approving most of the times, yeah, absolutely. And it, and it does it. And, and those are not, those weren't even the benefits that we were looking at. Those are just benefits that you get because you do it the right way, right? And you standardize the processes. It's also really important to, um. Not automate for the sake of automation, right? Um, a lot of times, uh, organizations would automate toil. That's not really good automation. Um, you, you have to first simplify the process. You have to make sure it's completely streamlined and then you automate it. Yeah, one of the things that we, um, see in many organizations like you have 10,000 pipelines, 20,000 pipelines, uh, that are built in Jenkins or something before. And when people say I'm gonna move to harness, let me bring the 10,000 pipelines from Jenkins to harness. So that's, that's, you lose the whole point. Like that's like you're taking the toil and the bad thing and harness you probably need like 30 or 40 or 50, no more than that if, if that, I think we. Really have like less than 10 types and that builds everything we need and like I said because of the fact that we can provide that that level they don't have to think it but they can add 2 for the specific things they need. There's no reason for all those, and now we're, now we're, uh, taking that same concept to because of the scale of Marriott we, uh, we have systems that are more centralized in nature like our global reservation system, right? It has to be in sync with each and every one of those 10,000 properties and the property management system. So we, we started using harness, um, more at the, the central systems what we call above property. But now we're working on efforts where we're gonna take it to at property workloads as well. And, and within that, maybe the 10 goes to 20 at most, but with those 20 pipelines, we're going to be deploying in 143 countries across multiple continents with different um legal and policy challenges, right? Um, whether it's China or it's India or it's Germany or, or, or wherever, right? All of that built into the pipeline just with a few patterns, that's the power of standardization and doing it the right way. That, that's so great to hear. That's what we like to evangelize a lot like, you know, if you standardize the, um, every app team thinks that app is very different, but in the, in the end, like, you know, you have some patterns like 10 patterns, 20 patterns, and. And you standardize you gain gain so much, but you want to have the flexibility, a bit, bit of flexibility there with the guardrails. So that's why we had this, you know, opine templates, but you can still go and modify, you know, but as you have to follow the guardrails. Exactly, there's only so many ways to build a docker image. Yes, yeah, cool. So, um, let's talk about AI a bit. You know, we are, uh, uh, it's, it's hard not to talk about AI in the, in the world of software engineering. So how, how are you guys thinking about AI and, uh, how does AI play the role, uh, in the future here to me, so coming from my vantage point of being in the dev ops space and whatnot. I think that particular area is so ripe for being able to take advantage of AI, uh, there is so much that happens within, you know, from going from story to production and so much information that. AI being able to grab that context from what's changing in the code to what's changing in the environment to the tests, being able to look at all of that and start helping fix the little problems that we don't wanna deal with, that is such a like you saw on the graph, such a huge waste of application developers' times and talent. AI is, I think, really going to take a big chunk of that out and let them focus more on, you know, working with cursor Windsurf, uh, Quiro, etc. and Cloud code and focusing on their applications and being able to create amazing things and not have to worry about, oh my unit has failed, uh, oh I've got a new CVE that popped up like. Just let it, you look at it, let it resolve, resolve it, give you the PR so you still have a human in the loop, make sure it doesn't do something a little crazy and go from there. And then the next step from there is as that continues to mature and you build out better systems around that and the models continue to get better, you can stop thinking about that human in the loop on that PR and just let the pipeline handle it because as you said, the pipeline's the new cab. Yeah, um, and, um, a lot of this work people don't, uh, you know, people are struggling to do, you know, it's like pipelines can do a lot of automation, but you still need to bring AI to write the test, you know, to interpret the outcomes of the test, you know, maybe to fix the code if something failed, you know, developers don't really want to do it, and, and, and it's AI can do a better job on many of these things now, uh, and to create all the checks and balances on the code coming in, you know, one of the things that we keep hearing is the. Just the, the code volume with AI is very high and it's, it like the, the same applications that used to have a million lines of code base would probably have for the same functionality like 2 or 3 million lines of code base now because AI writes a lot of code. It can be a little verbose, yeah, and, and it, it, it all goes back to that earlier comment around reducing the cognitive load, right, and I feel, um, as we modernize and as we go more towards, uh, more advanced systems and, and ways to develop them, um. The the definition of cognitive load also changes, so unit test becomes a cognitive load, right? um, uh, keeping tabs on all the different things that have to happen starting from scratch all of that becomes unnecessary things that if. We allow AI to do that, then we, uh, uh, then we in turn allow our engineers to really keep their eyes on the ball and really think about what the big picture is, what the real value is that they need to produce with that code, with that product, whatever it is that they're creating, and a lot of times we, um, engineers can't focus on that value. They take their eyes off the ball because they're just so inundated with all these million steps that have to happen before the value is even driven. And and many of those things they will lose track, you know, some balls will be dropped. It's hard to just, you know, uh, keep up with everything that's that's uh that's gonna happen, the million steps. So, what, what advice would you give to, uh, to the audience here, if people are looking at, uh, we have certain ways of doing things, CICD, uh, but we are looking at modernizing and, and looking at harness, uh, what advice would you give to them? Um, I would say particularly when you're looking to modernize within the CICE space. I, I said it kind of jokingly earlier like there's only so many ways to build a docker image really kind of keeping that in mind, you know, standardization will set you free in this space as much as any other, so having the ability to create a standardized template for the various types of, uh, applications that you'll need, uh, it's huge. Don't drag along the old tech debt just let it die. Uh, move on to the new system and let them start seeing the, the early wins. Find some teams in particular that are more for, you know, forward thinking that really wanna get, uh, get going in this, um, and work with them. Remember, they're your customer. So you need to make sure that their voice is heard and you're delivering them the product that they need as well. Uh, 100% agree early wins are extremely important. Uh, and they get overlooked, um, and the higher the velocity is, the more likely that you're gonna get some early wins. So velocity also matters, right? Not speed, velocity, right? It's a vector quantity, so it's not the distance, it's the displacement, right, uh, between the two points. So, so you have to enable that somehow, um, and, and you have to build that escape velocity. Once you build it, then your work is done. The teams will take care of the rest of it, right? Um, any leader who thinks that it's gonna go exactly how they, they, they thought it, um, uh, it is, I, I would say, um, being naive because. Most likely it's not gonna go the way you're thinking, right? There's always gonna be something that's gonna hit you sideways when you least expect it. And that's where it's really important to be able to change direction as needed. The, the agile mindset, you know, start small, change direction if you need to, you know, absolutely change there because these are big changes like the transformational effect on software engineering is very high, but you know people are resistant, so the thing, the number one thing that, you know, always amazes me is like, you know. If you can cut down something from 6 months to 35 minutes, uh, why, why would the organization resistant about it, but it's like people are sad in doing, uh, ways to start small and, and get them there. It's, it's changing the hearts and minds, right? Uh, especially over the last decade or so. Technology is no longer the bottleneck. Everything is possible. Anything is possible. You can do it. Um, use harness and everything's possible, that too, of course, but it's, it's really changing the, the mindset, right? Uh, organizations implement, uh, safe or agile practices, but they don't implement the agile mindset. They implement product model, but they don't build the level of accountability that needs to come with product model. They will bring in DevOps tool chain, but they will not build, uh, bring in, uh, uh, the. Uh, the culture of DevOps, you build it, you own it, soup to nuts, right? They will, they will continue to operate in an operations versus, uh, project environment. So I think changing those mindsets. And then leveraging tools like harness you rightfully said to automate and standardize the processes, really looking for those levers that will create the big waves. Yeah, definitely I think, uh, mindset is extremely important. Mindset combined with the automation and the tool chain. If you many times like it's hard to change the mindset if you don't give people the tool because then they say it's too hard to achieve what I want to achieve and then they won't change, uh, you know, change their approach so. If you combine the two and show them the path, you know, what, how you guys did it, like, you know, starting with your own internal platform engineering group and then, uh, moving from there. That's, uh, that, that, that, that makes sense. What advice would you give, uh, to people about evaluating, uh, you know, new products and tools in this space? Um. Keep going, always go in with an open mind. So when you're walking around, particularly like if you're walking around the expo here, um. Obviously go stop at the, the harness booth, check out the Squid Games, uh, the theme that they have. It's quite fun, but also, uh, wander around and, and make sure to check in at the, the tiny booths, um, you know, somebody that's still in a, a startup phase, that's kind of how we actually came across harness, uh, many years ago at, uh, it was either this event or the one that's, uh, or at Cuban, uh, came across a harness booth. You're still very early on, but like. That's a great idea and you kinda keep tabs on them. At the time, uh, where I was, we already had a very mature process, but hardness always stuck in my head and when it came to an opportunity to be able to start anew, uh, made a call and, uh, obviously kept going from there. But having a, having somebody that's really willing to like be your partner in this whole process too is very important. Changing the entire way that an organization builds, deploys, tests, uh, is gathering audit requirements, uh, and all of that. It, it's a huge deal. It's a very tough undertaking to really kind of make a big leapfrog, uh, uh, a big leap in that, in that space, uh, so having a partner that's kind of, you know, willing to, to, you know, go to the wall with you and help, uh, has been huge, and we've had that from, from your team. I know some folks that are here, uh, in the audience listening as well, and it's been great to work with and the fact that. Especially now, Harness has gone through it with us, we've gone through it with many others. It's good to have that experience to lean on too because you can't know it all. Yeah, a lot of, uh, a lot of large enterprises when they're, when they're, um, starting this, this journey, transformation journey rely on other large enterprises because they feel that they can actually help them scale, right? uh, and operate at scale, um, but the challenge with with dealing with a large enterprise is that they are very set in their ways, rightfully so because they have to standardize as well, right? Um, but working with an organization that's growing, that's thinking, and, and more importantly, rethinking how things are done, um, where you have the ability to have a conversation and influence their road map and product capabilities that goes a long way because every enterprise has these unique areas that have to be catered to, right? Um, and that's where our partnership, uh, with harness that that Marriott International has is, is, uh, really good because we can come and we can talk about, hey, we have a problem and you may not have a solution, but you will come up with a solution and you will work with us, right? And then that solution goes mainstream and, and, and, and it works with others as well. That agility generally comes from, um, smaller organizations that are more innovative. And we take a lot of pride in it. And even as we get bigger, we set up harnesses like multiple parallel startups so that we can retain that agility and, you know, ability to innovate very fast working with the working with the industry, working with partners. So, uh, we really appreciate the the the innovation partnership, uh, as well. Uh, thank you so much for, uh, for joining us today here and uh sharing your story, uh, and, uh, your partnership with Harness and how we were able to help here. I really, really appreciate it. Thank you everyone, uh, uh, for joining us for this session today. Hope you had a, a great conference, uh, and, uh, uh, a good nice trip home soon as well. OK.
