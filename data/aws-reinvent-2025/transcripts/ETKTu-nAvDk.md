summary: "Nivas Doray Raj (AWS Cloud Governance), Yukitaka Omura (AWS Specialist SA manager), and Nori Yamamoto (Chief Cloud Officer, Digital Agency of Japan) present a case study on how Japan's Digital Agency balances agility and compliance for over 1,700 local governments and 6,000+ AWS accounts. The session begins by defining cloud governance not as a roadblock but as a set of rules and processes that align business requirements, focusing on a \"landing zone\" architecture using AWS Organizations and Control Tower for multi-account management, centralized logging, and identity federation.\n\nYamamoto-san details the Digital Agency's inception in 2021 following a \"digital defeat\" during COVID-19. They established the \"Government Cloud\" to standardize digital infrastructure across ministries and local municipalities. To manage the massive scale (creating ~300 accounts/month), they automated provisioning using a \"vending machine\" approach (GCAS), reducing account creation time from 5 days to 1 hour and eliminating administrative manual work (from 260 hours to 0 hours per month). He emphasizes three key objectives: Governance (institutional via direct contracts/law, and technical via user-owned encryption keys in HSM), Local Autonomy (strict access controls where even Agency employees cannot access local government data), and Agility/Scalability (direct cloud access for users without API wrappers).\n\nOmura-san dives into four best practices implemented:\n1. **Align to Security Frameworks:** Using a principle-based approach mapped to NIST CSF and SP 800-53, utilizing detective controls (Security Hub, Config) over restrictive preventive controls to maintain developer freedom.\n2. **Strong Identity Foundation:** Integrating \"My Number\" cards for automated user authentication and using a simplified permission model (Admin vs. Non-Admin roles) in IAM Identity Center to bypass the 3,500 permission set limit.\n3. **Automated Provisioning:** Using GCAS to trigger Lambda functions for account setup and a \"pull-style\" deployment model (Service Catalog) for secure baselines, respecting local autonomy.\n4. **Continuous Monitoring:** Distributed notifications via EventBridge and Chatbot so local admins fix their own security issues, while the central agency monitors only critical events.\n\nThe session concludes with updates on AWS governance features, including account transfers between organizations and centralized billing views."\nkeywords: Cloud Governance, Digital Agency of Japan, AWS Control Tower, Government Cloud, Automated Provisioning, Local Autonomy, Security Hub, NIST CSF, IAM Identity Center, Service Catalog\n---

So I thought we would start with something a little different, uh, a joke. A senior civil servant was asked a question, how do you define cloud governance? They thought for a moment and responded. It's when we move our servers to the cloud, we also bring along our 500 page policy documents on our flights. It's governance in the cloud, um. So we do have a lot to share with you today. We're going to be spotlighting a major public sector organization. Japan's digital agency. The agency serves its citizens by spearheading the digital transformation of its national ministries and local governments. My name is Nivass Doray Raj. I'm part of our cloud governance team here at AWS, and we help our customers with building out foundations on AWS. We're joined by Mr. Omoaan, who is the specialist SA manager in Japan, and he leads cloud operations and cloud governance, and our special guest speaker, Mr. Yamamoto-san, who is the chief cloud officer. At the digital agency of Japan. Thank you. OK. Here's our agenda. We're gonna first talk about what does it mean to balance agility and compliance and why is it important for organizations. Then the core part of this presentation, the governance story of the digital agency of Japan. And lastly, we'll round it off with a few key governance launch updates. Let's talk about customer needs in highly regulated industries. Here are a few key needs that customers in this space have, and usually the customers are customers in health care, public sector, and financial services, but it's really any customer that's dealing with sensitive data sets as well as workloads with strict security and compliance requirements. So if you look at the innovation here. We're discussing teams that are expanding on the cloud, they're building new products and. They need to take advantage of some of our latest tooling, some of the latest AI services. They want to bring the products to market as quickly as possible with generative AI and agentic AI. It's really time for organizations to rethink existing processes and see how we can build some automation with AI. But if application teams are doing this, then the central operations teams will also have to think about how to expand the cloud environment and how to do it efficiently at scale. Organizational agility. This simply refers to the ability of an organization to adapt to change as well as deliver outcomes without unnecessary friction, essentially reducing roadblocks for the organization. And of course, our security and compliance teams are looking to make sure that the organization adheres to the security compliance regulation policies and standards and frameworks. So we can actually place these needs into two separate areas, agility and compliance. Your development teams are looking for the independence to make technical decisions on their own. They also want the freedom to experiment and build products. On the other side. Your central operations teams are looking to see how they can build efficiency and standardization at scale across the entire organization. And then of course your security teams are looking to implement controls. To make sure that the organization is following regulatory and compliance requirements. So there's a tension here. It almost seems like this is moving in opposing directions. And so the key insight here is that this isn't an either or proposition. It's actually a balanced approach. We need both agility and compliance within an organization. You will see that guardrails replace the roadblocks. We're simply defining clear boundaries on where teams can operate. And then automation enables compliance, and the last one is. It's a shared security. Model. Everybody is responsible for security and compliance. So we talked a little about, about cloud governance at the beginning, and that was the incorrect definition, but what's the real definition? And here at AWS we actually have a formal definition for cloud governance. It's a set of rules, processes, and reports that guide your organization to follow best practices, essentially building your foundation in alignment with the business requirements of the organization. So it's great to have a definition. But where do we begin? And so oftentimes this starts by building an environment on AWS. A great analogy to think of it is is a house, the same design principles when you're building a house, determining where the rooms go, the access points, the doors, very similar, you'll be building an AWS environment like this. We build our environment on AWS using two foundational services, AWS Organizations and AWS Control Tower. This diagram here. That is uh is a, is an architectural diagram, a multi-account environment. It's what AWS control tower deploys for you. And We're highlighting it here because it follows the well architected principles in building your foundations, and we'll talk about a few of them. And landing zone is simply means a secure, scalable multi-account environment. And if you look at this diagram here, notice the multiple accounts. This is actually a very key principle on how we design our services. We use multiple accounts because it helps us operate efficiently, it helps us manage our teams, and at the same time it reduces risk, security risk, reducing the security blast radius. And then if you look at this diagram. Notice that it sets up identity center. One of the very first steps that a lot of our customers take is that they set up identity access to the multiple accounts, and in this case, identity Center is integrated or can be integrated with Octaping any kind of identity federation provider. The next is the log archive account. This is based on the principle that we want to track activity that's taking place across your environment. And so in this case, control tower is centralizing cloud trail logs across its environment and it's also including AWS config logs. So we're tracking the API activity as well as the resource configuration changes that are important for. Compliance as well as operational investigations. Next is the audit account. Um, you can also think of it as the security account. Here lies all of our security administrative tools and in control tower's case, it sets up the AWS Kinfig aggregator. We'll hear a little bit more about Kinfig in a future slide, but the takeaway here is that you can receive security notifications on non-compliant resources across your environment. Now, provisioning accounts. I guess I want to be clear that the When we create accounts. It's quite simple to create an account, but when you provision an account, there's actually a lot more steps that take place in provisioning an account. We're actually customizing the account so that it can be used by other teams. Typically what happens is customers will set up the proper networking resources, identity, security, lots of administrative tools, and in some cases they may also set up. Depending on who is using those accounts, domain-specific tools could be Sage maker or could be database tools and so on. So, that's what it means to provision accounts. We, we provide some customization frameworks to do this, but it's important to understand that sometimes provisioning accounts can get complicated and can take some time. It's different from account creation. Lastly, it's the QR code at the edge. It guides you on how to create some OUs within your environment. You don't have to create every single OU, but the principle to take away here is that create OUs based on common policy groupings. So this summarizes our environment best practices. Use accounts as building blocks, the multi-account environment, automate the account provisioning and customization, Track activity across your environment and implement a strong identity federation. OK. So landing zone governance. We talked about the landing zone. We talked about centralizing identity access and logging. Automating account provisioning. But there's something that's missing, something very important and important for security and compliance. It's establishing controls. So there are 3 types of governance controls. Preventive And here, we're simply making sure that users and roles are restricted from performing actions on resources, and this applies across the CLI and console. And then with proactive controls. We're scanning the resources before they are provisioned, and this can take place with infrastructures code and sometimes developer pipelines. The benefit of proactive controls is that this leads to developer development efficiency uh along the same lines of shifting left principles, but we're catching the errors before it gets provisioned or deployed and then the last advantage of proactive controls too is also about the cost efficiency we are um. We're preventing the resources from being deployed, so that results in lower costs. And then the last one is detective controls. These are simply non-blocking rules, but will tell you, will evaluate certain resources and tell you what's compliant or non-compliant. So, AWS organizations has 3 preventive controls, 2 of them launched last year, resource control policies and declarative policies. With service control policies, we are preventing or restricting identities based on API actions and I'm sure everyone's quite familiar with them. Um, they've been around for several years, but you can apply them to. All of our AWS resources, containers, EC2 StageMaker, and so on. Now, RCPs, resource control policies, define the maximum available permissions on a resource. So we typically see this being used for data perimeter use cases and um it's, it's very helpful when we are able to apply. What permissions can be enabled on a service at scale across a multi-account organization. And so the services that it supports today are S3, KMS and Secrets Manager. Um But very powerful when you don't have to think about what permissions should be allotted to each and every resource in your organization. And then declarative policies are also very powerful here, they enforce a desired configuration for a resource, and those resources include VPC, EC-2, and EBS. But again, the power here is that this is applied at scale. Now AWS configures, these are our detective controls. I think the main points I'd like you to take away from here is We can group config rules into. Conformance packs, and that makes it easier to deploy across the organization, maintain the config rules, as well as view them centrally in a dashboard. So that's the benefit of using conformance packs. And then config also supports aggregators in control tower, you notice that we had set up a config aggregator in the security account, but you can also create custom config aggregators for your own. Social accounts or regions. And then custom rules. You can build custom rules depending on what your business requirements are, and almost every single customer will want to create custom rules, and the easiest way to create custom rules today is using Quiro or Amazon Que developer. It used to be a lot more complicated. Um, we did have some frameworks earlier, but now it's far easier to create it with um some of our Gen AI tooling. So the question is, Should we start by building custom rules? You certainly could. But we would recommend that you also take a look at our managed. Controls. And we have a number of managed controls across our services. AWS control tower has over 1000 control types as well as 17 frame frameworks. So, you can search through these common controls and understand. How to apply them at scale across your multi-account environment and that's a big benefit of using control tower controls. It doesn't just apply to one account, it applies to all of the accounts that are under control tower governance. And then we also have security hub CSPM. And this checks to confirm if an AWS environment is following security best practices. It centralizes the findings across all of your accounts and you can also integrate it with third-party security tools. So here we have two separate AWS services with managed controls. The question that often our customers ask is, how do we know? Which service is applying which control and. Why are these controls being used? And so that's why we have the controls catalog, which is also part of AWS control tower today. Um, but it lets you search, list out your controls across your environment, understand the control objectives, for example, whether we are using it for a control for data encryption, lets you search which kinds of controls are applied to different services and so on like that. So, you don't even have to enable AWS control tower to search through the catalog. You can simply visit the catalog and list out the managed controls there. So here are the control's best practices. Align your control objectives to a security framework. Apply the detective controls before the preventive controls, and this is a very important one because far too often we see that customers are impacted by applying preventive controls. And while It might seem like it, there will be no impact. It has impacted production workloads. So the guidance here is try as much as possible to apply detective controls, understand what is non-compliant before applying preventive controls. And then, of course, the last one is continuous, continuously monitor and test your controls. Your development teams are always building using new tools. We want our controls to adapt to what your teams are doing in the organization. So, the question is, um, I talked a lot about AWS cloud governance principles and we covered a little bit of information on services, but how does this look like in a real world scenario? How do you implement governance defined by law? And where does a large organization even begin? The Digital Agency of Japan supports 1,700+ local governments and has an environment of 6,000+ accounts. Here's a short video introducing. The agency You can't see digital technology. But it's always there, right beside you. And there are things only digital can make possible. With digital, you can get the certificates you need without worrying about having enough time. Payments are made simpler and easier by using your My Number card. At school, everyone can learn at their own pace using personalized textbooks or digital tools. Your identity can be verified securely at events. Even when you're busy caring for your child, you can submit applications without visiting public office. Even if a patient cannot speak, their medical history and prescriptions can be shared immediately. Anytime, anywhere, the right service for the right person at the right moment. By providing personalized support for all, we strive to build an inclusive society accessible to everyone. Digitalization for everyone in everyday life. Digital agency. Is that? OK. Hi everyone, can you hear me? OK, good. I'm Nori Yamamoto, Chief Cloud Officer of digital agency in Japan. Uh, I'd like to talk about how we achieved both scalability and governance in our government cloud project in Japan. First of all, let me introduce digital agency itself. Digital agency was founded in September 2021, just after the COVID-19 worldwide shock. During the COVID-19, we Japanese noticed that we could not trace who was vaccinated or not, where the vaccines are available or in short, because of the paper and manual operations. At that time, one of the ministers referred to it as a digital defeat. To solve this situation, digital agency was founded and has been driving the digital transformation of the government over the past 4 years. We achieved many things. For example, the my number card. You saw the my number card in the videos. Uh my number card is a national ID card in Japan. And which are possessed by 100 million people, almost 80% of the population in Japan. Recently, there's some personal information like medical information or tax information, those information are integrated into the My Number card and my number portal. So we can access to the digital application by using the Menberer. The government cloud, the government cloud is the baseline for those digital transformation or digital applications. And many systems start using the government cloud as their common platform. Uh, for, for the common platform for the digital transformation, not only the central government, ministries and agencies, but also the local governments. We actually, we have 1700 local governments and a quasi-public organizations. Now, we have more than 6000 AWS accounts, and 300 to 400 accounts are created in every month recently. It's going very fast. To create 300 AWS accounts in one month, the account provisioning must be automated. That we will develop such kind of automation, not me exactly. The subtle sun, the courts and any other members developed it. And before the automation, uh, the users were in the queue of the account creation and have to wait for that completion for 5 working days. But after the automation, uh, the users can start using the cloud in the next day. And the reduction in our administrative tasks, uh, those are very significant also. Uh, before, before the automation, uh, the, the creating accounts took 30 minutes, and some preparatory tasks related to several accounts took 1 hour or so. So the creating the 300 AWS accounts in one month, it used to take 260 person hours, but after the automation we reduced it to 00. So that's the results of our our scalability mechanism we developed. And before explaining our scalable scalable mechanisms. We government officials must emphasize the governance is also very important. And for the local governments, the independence of the local governments, local autonomy is also very crucial. And the governance and the local autonomy and scalability, those are kinds of contradictions, I think. So the government card must be the balanced platform that resolves the conflict between the governance, local govern, local autonomy, and scalability, enabling all these achieved. So again, the governance and the local autonomy and scalability, those are government objectives. I'll explain 3 objectives, uh, uh, and how we achieved, uh, 3 objectives by balancing all of them. But before explaining three objectives, let me explain the system overview of the government cloud. The users can access to their own cloud environment directly. And the management functions and the logs functions are set up aside the cloud environment, the user's cloud environment, by using the cloud service, cloud services like control tower or security hub as Nbus mentioned. And then the GCAS, Government Cloud Assistance Services, which is the web services we developed, uh, that's so-called the vending machine, and also the uh visualizing dashboard or payment management systems. Those are developed, uh, outside the management functions of the government cloud by connecting loosely. So to achieve the agility and scalability. We have to avoid creating the bottlenecks like wrapping API or multilos integrated management systems over top of the clouds. Instead, we enable users to leverage the cloud technology directly. So the users can use the government clouds just as they would the public cloud. Then the first objective, the governance. I'll explain, I'll explain two aspects of the governance. The one is institutional aspect, and the other is the technical aspect. The first one is institutional aspect. Data are encrypted and dealt under the direct contract between Japanese government and the CSPs. The direct contract is very important for claiming the sovereign immunity. The direct contract is under the Japanese law. And storing data domestically is very important for ensuring that loads loads effect directly. And the storing the data domestically and dealt appropriately to, to ensure those kind of things, the audit and the crowd certification called East map in Japan, those are very important. To summarize, uh, uh, sorry, to summarize, uh, data are managed, uh, domestically, and it's under the direct contract based on the Japanese law. We can ensure those are operated appropriately according to the audit and certification. So that's, that's how we achieved the institutional aspect of the governance. And second, the technical aspects of the governance. Data are encrypted by the user's own encryption key. The encryption key is stored in HSM and hardware security module, uh, which is uh the certified as the FIS 140. The encryption keys authorized by the uh authorized to be managed by the key owner in the key management services. So to access the encryption key, keyona is strictly identified by my number and is strongly authenticated by MFA devices. So nobody can access the data directly bypassing encryption. And technically, the data is fully controlled by the key owner only. Therefore, the data are governed both institutionally through contract and law and technically through encryption and strict key management. Those kind of governance approach doesn't impact the scaling because there are no bottlenecks for the user applications except uh encryption. They, the users, just encrypt data. Then the second objective is local autonomy. Uh, so as I mentioned before, uh, the local government emphasize the local autonomy, local autonomy, independence, their independence. So only pre predefined automated process can access to environment. And even digital agency employees must not have access to the environment of the local government. And when digital agency employees access to management accounts, management functions, uh, the predefined procedures are required. And those kinds of procedures and operations are reviewed by the auditor every year. So the uh users are uh uh of course, uh, data encrypted, and data s even the data agency employees cannot access to data directory bypassing encryption. So the user, so the user can control the data in the independent environment from CSP and digital agency. And those kind of local autonomy approach doesn't impact the scaling also, also. And the third objectives, the agility and scalability. As I mentioned before, the agility and scalability is almost realized by the cloud technology like control tower. But it's still necessary to map the real structure to AWS organizations because the real structure, the organizational structure, power structure which is defined who is responsible for what, those differ one organization to another. So the AWS organizations service is not enough to represent the real organizational structure. Rather than that, I think AWS organizations must be designed according to ADA's AWS best practices, like SGP policies, etc. So we need to develop the mapping functions between the real structure to AWS organizations, and we have to develop the management system of mapping information. Then we developed automated such kind of process during the during the provisioning. That caused the results of our scalable scalability mechanisms, as I mentioned before, the, the waiting time reduction, uh, the task reduction. Sorry. And we, uh, sorry, and we developed, uh, these 3 objectives over 5 CSPs we contracted. So multiple cloud strategy is very important, I think. We defined some rules as our multiple cloud strategy. For example, one, the first one is one CSB for one system. Do not split a single cohesive system into the multi multiple clouds. Even if they would like to conduct they would like to build the redundant system across the clouds. They can build the redundant system even in one CSP by using the multiple regions, and multiple availability zone. If they split the systems, one system into the multilos, it leads to cost increase and the complex operations, I think. The second one is, it's similar to the first one. Unnecessary for integrated management systems. I think one operational organization, one operational team should deal with one CSP because when they want to deal with two crowds, they have to acquire skills double, and they have to pile up the knowledge double. So those leads to cost increase and the complex operations. And the third thing is data portability. Data portability is also important, of course, and the data and the programs related to, especially related to the core application, uh, those are, uh, those should be exported, and those, uh, data and the programs portability is very important. So for example, the container technology rather than lambda function as a services. Uh, those are, those would be preferred. Especially for the core applications. And in the final deck. We are planning the additional services around the existing ones to assist the cloud usage, total cloud usage from the uh first registration to the operations. For example, we will release Git services. We call it GCAS DevStack in April 2026. And regarding AI, uh, we, we've been prepared AI environments where the user can utilize AI services. And Japan has announced the government policy to actively utilize AI and prepare and will prepare for the government AI. So the AI services in government cloud will be the platform, will be the infrastructure for government AI. So we are continuously contributing to it. So that's, those are how we achieved 3 objectives of the government cloud, and how we achieved both scalability and governance in our government cloud projects. So I'll introduce Omuraan. Omurrasan will explain technically in more detail. Omrasan, please. Thank you. Thank you very much, Yamamoto-san, for sharing valuable experience at Government Cloud in Japan. Hi. Uh, I'm Yukitaka Omura, manager of Specialist Solution Architects in Japan. I worked with digital agency to build the agility and governance in the government crowd. As we discussed digital agencies's case, a key point of their success was the implementation of best practices for government, cloud, cloud governance. Uh, Nebus already shared several best practice with us, with us, and I'll pick up 4 best practice, and I, I'll dive deep into these best practices and let's learn the lesson from digital. First, best practice is align control objectives to a security framework. How to achieve this in digital relationship? For governance, as Yamamoto-san explained, start with the law, and finally, it's implemented at the end. Digital agency aligns with principle-based approach. So, a high-level high-level document like law and guide regulation defines the guideline. And each organizations and systems needs to determine and define their own controls following that guidance. As you can see on top, In Japan, we have a law, the Basic Act on Cybersecurity. And for the regulation, National Cybersecurity Office defined a unified standards for information security measures for government agencies. And digital agency created a guideline, a security by design guideline for government information system. These guidelines are not so specific enough, so they difference the framework, uh, like NIST CSF and control catalogs like NIST SB 853. With this framework and control catalog, they mapped their guidelines to implementation. And here is another control objective. Ensure proper security measures without disrupting operational efficiency. To achieve this, they use two types of controls. First one is preventative control. They are using A organization's service control policy, but they use this in minimum because they don't want to limit the developers' function uh feature, uh, developers. Uh, for example, uh, prevent users from creating IM user and access keys. That's a preventative control. And they mainly rely on detective controls. They are using AWS Security Hub CSPM. For the detective controls, uh, for example, uh, AWS config should be enabled, and so on. To implement that, they're using uh AWS Security Hub CSPM standard like CIS Benchmark and AWS Foundational Security Best Practices. Security have already have managed control and mapping to framework, so they can easily implement control objective. This is how they uh created uh the controls. Moving to the next topic. The second best practice is to implement strong identity foundation. As Yamamotosan mentioned, they manage, they're managing several thousands of users, local government and its users. So auto automation and uh scalability are the keys. First challenge is the 5 days to create users. Because that's because they have a manual user process, manual user authentication process. So they created auto authentication systems to use my number card. As Yamoto-san said, it's uh Japan's national ID card. So they implement it on GCAS. GCAS is uh government cloud assistance systems that they created, and on top of that, they implement that user authentication systems. With this automation automated system, they uh they reduced the lead time of user creation from 5 days to just 1 hour and also reduce the workload of digital agency. 2nd challenge is thousands of users on IM Identity Center. There is a limitation of permissions, number of permission sets in IMI Identity Center. That's 3500. To scale that, they have, they created the idea just 2 permission sets. Administrator and non-administrator. For administrator, uh, they, uh, they associate it with the administrator permission set. With that permission set, when user creates the account, uh, the administrator role will be created. With this role, they can create another role. They don't use IM users uh because digital agency. Not permit to create IM users. So instead of that, uh, they create roles on guest account. To use such a law, such a role, uh, they use non-administrative role. This, uh, the non-administrative user, this user is associated with the permission set for switch role only role. With this role, no administrator user can switch the other roles like developer roles and operator roles. With this simple model, Uh, they can easily scale user management. And keep it simple to manage users. The 3rd best practice is automate account provisioning and customization. Yamamoto-san said they create 370 accounts per month. So they need to automate everything. They are using multiple cloud service provider. So when user wants to create an account, uh they they access to the GCAS first. And from GCAS, uh, it's kick the step functions workflow and send the request, and store the request to the SQS. Then, uh, labar function, create account uh with control tower. This SQS is needed to limit the uh Account creation. Uh, in, uh, parallel account creation, uh, because, uh, control tower is control tower limits uh account creation to 5 at once. Then They call several APIs with lambda function. Uh, for example, subscribe to enterprise support and so on. As you may know, control tower have account factory customization with infrastructures code like uh cloud formation. However, infrastructure's code is suitable for defining the status. So instead of that, uh, to define the procedure, uh, lambda function is uh suitable. And especially uh subscribed to enterprise support is not supported by cloud cloud formation. So in such case, the lambda function is suitable. And also They have another database on GCAS. This is because this is real world. So when user wants to create an account, uh, digital agency needs to have some real world information like local government name or email address for billing. To store these data uh on ZCAS, uh, they don't need to have manual process like uh writing some information on note or so. Like this, this agency created a fully automated mechanism, uh, account, uh account creation. And uh yeah. This is the uh automated one-time account setup. For the resources defined by Infrastructures code and require changes in the future, digital agency uses two-type deployment model with service catalog. What is prototype deployment? They defined secure baseline, for example, check and remove the security group, and so on. Uh, this is defined by CDK. And they created service catalog products uh from that. And when local government administrator want to deploy it, they pull that product and deploy it on their account. By themselves. Then they create their own systems. These two type deployment compare to push-style deployment. It's like a cloud formation stackets and so on. However, uh, if digital agency uses cloud formation stack sets, there are two problems. First one is digital agency is not permitted to access to the guest account because of the local autonomy. This is one problem. And the second problem is if Digital agency deploy these baseline by cloud mission success. They need to coordinate with the local government administrators, for example, when the template will be deployed or what's the current status of that secure baseline. So this prototype deployment model uh enabled them uh This secure baseline uh without any coordination by local government administrator. And when uh data agency want to update the secure baseline, it's very simple. Digital agency uh should uh update, just update the service catalog product. Then a local government administrator uh pull that new version of the product and deploy it by themselves. There is no coordination between digital agency and local adminis local government administrator. This is a pool-style deployment model. OK. Last best practice is continuous monitoring and testing of controls. Don't set and forget. In the government crowd, local government administrator has responsibility to fix security issues. However, digital, digital agencies administrator uh usually don't send security issues to local government administrator. So how to notify? In the secure baseline, Digital agency already defined the uh event bridge rules and the AWS chatbot. With these services, uh, security detected security issues sent to the local government administrator directly. And they fix that security issues by themselves. These distributed notification systems enabled digital agency not to handle a massive number of alerts. Because they have thousands of accounts. Then also enable to align local autonomy. However, as an administrator, there's an agency needs to understand the security posture of the government crowd. To do that, they get periodic report from security hub and check critical events only. Once they find critical event. They notified to local government administrator. This is how they implement to to manage security postures at scale. This concludes Aab's cloud governance best practice that digital agency has addressed in detail. So I'll hand it back to Nivas to wrap up this presentation. Thank you. Thank you. So you heard from Mr. Yamamoto-san and Mr. Omura-san on how the digital agency achieved a real-world implementation of cloud governance and had real impact. And this is just a summary of the best practices, so feel free to take a picture. Um, We covered it all in our sessions. And now the launch updates. We had several and we just decided to point out a few of the key ones. Namely, transfer accounts. A lot of organizations are moving accounts between different organizations uh for mergers and acquisitions or just different business needs, and in the past we had to make an account stand alone, add credit card information, and then move it to the second organization. Now you can simply invite the account over to the target um organization, so this makes it much more efficient. 2nd launch AWS billing transfer. While we still recommend that organizations use a single organization. Sometimes there are cases where companies and customers have to use multiple organizations when due to regulatory compliance or actual business requirements. Uh, example, partners that are supporting multiple customers. In this case, um, in the past, administrators to log into each and every management account of the different organizations and review the cost, the cost analysis and invoicing. Now, you can centralize that. Now you have centralized view of what can be take, what's taken across, across multiple organizations, um. And so this helps with invoice collection, payment processing, and cost analysis. And something to note here too about the AWS organizations, even though the administrator can review. Across different organizations, each organization is still responsible for its security, so this is just. Sending costs over, centralizing it, providing cost visibility, but the security management is still separate. On controls only, we talked about the controls catalog, we talked about AWS control tower. Um, now you can have a controls only experience with AWS control tower. You don't necessarily need the landing zone components, um, and so this will be very helpful for customers that have already built out a custom landing zone. They can simply take advantage of. The controls and control tower which include SCPs, RCPs, as well as config rules to apply it scale. So, as next steps, um, just sharing some resources. I did not um share all of our launches, but um this QR code summarizes a list of our cloud governance and other launches. And The key takeaway, cloud governance gives you the right foundation to experiment and execute. Um, we saw this clearly with the governance story of the digital agency of Japan. Um, And Thank you very much for the engagement and support and special thanks to Mr. Yamamotosa. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
