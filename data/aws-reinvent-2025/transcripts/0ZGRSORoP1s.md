summary: "This session introduces \"Hawkeye,\" an Agentic AI Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) developed by New Bird, designed to automate the root cause analysis and resolution of production incidents. The presenter addresses the common challenge faced by operations teams: the overwhelming volume of alerts and the manual, stressful labor required to sift through dashboards during an outage. Hawkeye aims to alleviate this burden by connecting directly to a wide array of telemetry sources—including DataDog, Splunk, Grafana, Prometheus, and AWS CloudWatch—as well as configuration interfaces like the AWS Console and Kubernetes infrastructure. By doing so, it serves as a \"cross-platform\" agent that bridges the silos often created by vendor-specific AI tools.

The core of the presentation demonstrates how Hawkeye moves beyond simple alert summarization to perform deep, autonomous investigations. Using a \"Chain of Thought\" reasoning process, the agent asks and answers a series of diagnostic questions, analyzing traces, logs, metrics, and security configurations to pinpoint the root cause of an issue. This analysis is delivered not just via a UI, but \"headlessly\" through platforms where engineers already work, such as Slack, Microsoft Teams, or ServiceNow. A key feature highlighted is Hawkeye's integration with modern coding assistants like Claude Code, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This allows SREs to interact with the agent directly within their IDE/terminal, querying past incident data or even generating and executing remediation scripts (e.g., creating a missing AWS IAM role) without switching contexts.

Real-world use cases are cited to illustrate the agent's versatility: an insurance company using it to manage incidents across a complex hybrid on-prem/AWS environment, a logistics firm monitoring critical nightly data pipelines, and an Australian bank automating compliance reporting for backup failures. The speaker emphasizes flexibility in deployment, noting that while a SaaS version is available for quick onboarding via the AWS Marketplace (with a two-week free trial), security-conscious enterprises can deploy Hawkeye directly within their own VPC to maintain strict control over their data and AI models.

Ultimately, the session positions the \"AI SRE\" not as a replacement for human engineers, but as a force multiplier that removes the drudgery of \"fighting fires.\" By automating the collection and analysis of evidence, Hawkeye allows human SREs to focus on preventative measures and system hardening. The presenter concludes by encouraging attendees to try the self-service onboarding, framing the tool as a vendor-neutral \"Swiss Army knife\" capable of orchestrating incident response across a fragmented landscape of observability tools."

Thank you. Welcome, everybody. So you know I'm wearing my agentic shirt today. Uh, are you all wearing your agentic uh, outfits? Everybody's agentic, but I'm gonna actually present today an actual agent and actually two agents working together which I'm super excited about. So the AI SRE is all about solving problems in production, right? Everybody has observability. You have all this data, but you need to solve problems under pressure and you have to go through a lot of data to do that so that's the topic today we're gonna see how agents can help analyze the root cause of issues and really reduce your mean time to resolution right? by automating the process of investigating the root cause and then I'll show you how you can work with your coding agent cloud code. Cursor, GitHub co-pilot, etc. To actually implement the resolution recommended by our agent that does the analysis this is delivering massive productivity gains to our customers but also reduction of outages, better system availability and up time, right? And so the impact of incidents can be very costly and that's what an agent can do and that's really driving massive savings and one note is that. You know our customers are deploying this without changing any of their existing tools, so you keep your observability, your incident management. People work with the tools they're used to and here we're having an agent that's gonna help them, OK, so that's just a few examples we have an insurance company that's really for them it's all about reducing the cost of incidents. They have a complex on-prem and AWS footprint and issues that span those can be all analyzed by Hawkeye. Hawkeye is the name of our agent. The company is called New Bird. And Hawkeye can deploy as a SAS product or in your VPC. So if you're a security conscious company and you want control over your AI, we can actually deploy Hawkeye in your VPC. That's what this insurance company is doing and it's connected to their on-prem telemetry. We have a, um, you know, shipping and logistics company where for them it's all about managing data pipelines, massive numbers of night jobs that are running on data bricks with, uh, flank jobs running on EKS, and they have, uh, to make sure all these. And in time, right? And so for them it's all about, you know, handling all these alerts that come off of these uh data pipelines nightly jobs and the last example is a bank in Australia that uses us the first use case now they use us across a lot of use cases. The first use case was as simple as backup management. So if you're a bank and you have a lot of backups, you need to explain why they're failing and how you're gonna avoid the backups from failing again because there's regulations around that. OK, so those are some quick examples and really again it's about helping this guy right? and it's we call it an AISRE but it's serving the whole company and usually there's like an on call team right that are not maybe the SREs but they pull in the SREs when they don't know how to solve the problem and you end up with all these people sifting through all the information because you have this. Dynamic cloud environment with lots of layers, lots of telemetry, lots of alerts, and then inevitably you have lots of people jumping on a call. Have you been on one of these calls where you know like there's 30 people there and it's interrupting your day? It's stressful. Nobody knows why they're there. There's finger pointing potentially, hopefully not. So what if you could just have a very clean explanation of what's going on and that's really what we're doing we're taking you from a manual workflow where you have people logging into Data Dogs Plonk. You know, uh, Grafana, cloud watch, etc. and doing kind of the mental work of looking at dashboards and trying to explain what's going on to then be able to resolve it so we're taking this manual workflow and automating it with an agent that can trigger automatically connect to your telemetry, explain exactly what's going on, and provide a very uh easy to read summary for the user. So anybody want to see that? OK, so this is Hawkeye. We're looking at a dashboard and on the left we have incidents and alerts that have not been investigated and on the right we're seeing incidents and alerts that have been investigated. So what I'm gonna do is show you the information that we're providing in an alert context. So you see there's some user initiated and automated sessions. So let's just look at this one. I'm gonna pick one at random. This one happens to be a data dog monitor. I have a tremendous amount of context here for the agent to work with because I'm triggering automatically off of an alert. Alerts have rich context for the agent to do the work. The work happens in the background and what you're seeing here can be delivered wherever the team is working. It could be on Slack, it could be on Teams, it could be in your coding agent. It could be on a ServiceNow. Basically I think the future is headless. We have a UI here where you can kind of consult the information, but you should be able to consume this information no matter where you work without necessarily coming to our user interface. But in here I can kind of see the summary, the incident description, the, uh, application artifacts, timeline of events, the evidence, the root cause, and the corrective actions. OK, so. That con contrast that with just the alert you know that Jason I showed you, you know, the in service now you might see it represented there's some, uh, you know, AI SRE tools that are just basically regurgerating, regurgitating that, you know, uh, summarizing it and presenting the alert to you, but what we're doing here is we're digging deep into the actual data. In your observability tools, the, the traces, the telemetry, the metrics, the logs, also your config, right? We can log in to your AWS uh console and see all the same data that you see there, how your security groups. Are configured how your EKS cluster is configured we could use Copcuddle to go and interrogate the Kubernetes cluster so we're doing what an SRE would do to kind of find a root cause, not just kind of summarizing what we're seeing in the alert. And all this work is available here so typically the work flow is you just get the conclusion the corrective actions you take those actions and you close the ticket but sometimes you have to dig deeper of course you have kind of a a budget for investigations you know by default we just go and do what we call one you know prompt cycle so here is a chain of thought. And we have like 5 or 6 questions that we're gonna go through and to answer each of them we're gonna consult a series of data sources and you can see here the full list of data sources available for this particular investigation. There were a lot of them config traces, logs, metrics. All consulted in order to provide this very deep and rich analysis and so at every step I have all this analysis and that is what gets them summarized in the RCA itself that gets shipped off to your Slack channel etc. And something that I'm very excited about is this new capability that I'm gonna show you that we just released which allows you to work in your coding assistant. So here I'm showing you loud code and uh you know I think real SREs, they don't like UI's that's my kind of uh theory. And they work in a shell and they're really good with scripting and working in shells. And if you're that kind of person and you're looking to leverage AI to do your work, I would say go to cloud code. That should be your first step, right? And I'm sure most of you have already taken that step. It's extremely powerful because it can use all your uh available CLI tools that you have on your system. And then it has this concept of an MCP server that you can add to it. An MCP server stands for Model context protocol. Think of it as kind of a an API that the LMM can automatically understand and interrogate, and it's basically self documenting so they can you can kind of plug in these tools and you can start plugging in a bunch of. MCP servers, but at some point, the more you plug in, the, you get diminishing return. So what we're doing is we're taking your data dock connection, your AWS information, your CICD pipeline, your GitHub connection, all that is managed by Hawkeye, and Hawkeye is providing one MCP server to the, uh, um, to the, uh, coding assistant here. That can basically orchestrate the whole thing that I showed you earlier, the, the whole investigation can learn over time, can do all these things, but now I can kind of talk to that one MCP server as an SRE and be like, OK, I want to do things, uh, with this MCP ser server so it's self documenting. You can actually ask it, you know, what do you do? How can I use this MCP server? It can help you with the onboarding process. You can have, um. You know, all the uh these typical workflows listing alerts, starting an investigation, monitor the progress of an investigation. Get results of an investigation so I use this extensively like we do evaluations and PLC so I can download all uh root cause analysis and then run queries in my coding assistant across all the RCAs for the last week. Maybe I'm looking for patterns. I'm looking for things that keep happening. I wanna analyze all my. Alerts and find, you know, the, the thing that I should be actually fixing as a site reliability engineer. Our job is not to just fight fires, is to prevent them, right? And with my coding agent and this deep kind of analytic capability of Hawkeye that can go and look at all my telemetry, I can prompt Hawkeye to do all this deep research. Extract all this information and then process this information in my coding agent. I can also automate the remediation steps recommended by Hawkeye. And so this is what you're seeing here a set of, uh, things that I go through normally, right? How do I create an ADOS connection? It's helping me. On board Hawkeye, right, it's showing me exactly what I need to do. I can ask, you know, because it's connected to my AWSCLI. I can ask it to create this role that Hawkeye needs, right? So I can do the whole work flow right here on board, set up my project that basically takes the connections and combines them into and where you can also add instructions because. You know our systems are very complex and Hawkeye can do a tremendous job of kind of understanding the dependencies, discovering the configuration and all that, but sometimes just like you on board a very smart SRE. You know that person needs a bit of help, right, instructions so the same thing can be done with Hawkeye where even I use cloud code to actually create those instructions sometimes because I can basically, you know, use it to create really great context for Hawkeye to use in in it's it its investigations, OK, so. You know, I, I do all types of work here. I, you, I can summarize, uh, all my past investigations. I can eventually look at the RCAs and usually at some point I need to get back into the, um, the user interface and I. Can ask for a link right here, right? So I can just jump back into the UI to, uh, you know, if I prefer a UI, right? And as I, I mentioned earlier, you can always ask follow up questions on an investigation and Hawkeye actually recommends some questions and you can set it up so that it automatically answers that question. So you think of it as you have like a budget for investigations and some alerts you're gonna say just keep going until you think you're done. By default we go, as I mentioned, one round, right? Like we go 5 questions, one chain of thought. Then we stop, we summarize, but we can automate the follow up question or you can have your team ask that follow up question in cloud code in cursor in Slack on Teams, wherever they want to work. So that's kind of the vision for working with an agent is you have agents working with other agents through MCP. You have people working with agents without necessarily using a tool, right? I'm on Slack. I'm just talking to this agent. It's providing me useful information. I'm asking for follow up questions. I'm not really using a new tool. I'm just, there's something in the background that's helping me and that's kind of the vision that we have for agentic SREs, you know, there's, there's a lot of things that SREs need to do and we're connected to so many other teams, DBAs, etc. We're gonna have a lot of different agents doing all these pieces of the work and I think you know a a great model is to use a coding agent as your main interface where you're basically interacting with all these different agents that help you do your job. We have um a lot of traction in this space and a lot of excitement around this and. We are also just launched yesterday. I don't know if you saw the news, but we have now launched self-service onboarding so you can go to your AWS account in the marketplace and say I wanna start using Hawkeye, and we will automatically provision a SAS instance of Hawkeye for you, and you will get a two week trial. And you're up and running within 5 minutes, you can start using Hawkeye and you pay as you go. So, no commitment, just go to the AWS console, go to your marketplace, find new bird there, and start using it. Right away and so within 15-20 minutes you'll be actually running deep analysis on your alerts and you can configure your uh AWS um. Cloud watch you can configure Data Dog uh Dynatrace we have, uh, Grafana as well available there for enterprise customers. We go and do private offers we deploy in your VPC. We use your LLMs we can connect to any, uh, observability tool of your choice, any incident management tools of your choice, but for those that just wanna get started self-service. They can just simply uh connect and get started right away with our SAS offering. So again, we're. Basically connecting to everything under the sun you'll see a lot of different solutions out there people claiming they have an AISRE. Amazon just launched theirs yesterday. We're excited to have Amazon also join the uh. The efforts to help SREs, what you'll find is a lot of them are kind of siloed. So you've got one for AWS, uh, CloudWatch, one for Data Dog. They have their Bits AI. You have one, Dynarace have their agent. We believe that, you know, most organizations have more than one source of data. And our agent goes across all that, so a lot of people have, you know, maybe they use CloudWatch for some of the, uh, Amazon services. They use Prometheus to monitor the metrics for Kubernetes. They use Data Dog for, uh, this other service, right? That it's a patchwork usually unless you're super consolidated and even if you're consolidated. You know, most of these agents are limited. Like we can actually look at configs we can use coop cuddle. We can bring in MCP servers if you have your own data that you wanna provide. So we believe that you need a, uh, kind of a Swiss Army knife that's orchestrating your incident response across all these tools to help you along and make sure that. You you look like this guy, not the guy we saw earlier. Super happy now you're just having a great time working with your coding agent and Hawkeye. So let me skip through some of this. I just wanna leave you here. I have 1 minute 18 seconds. I'm, I think I'm gonna finish early, but I really encourage you to go and on board, start. Here and sign up and just try it and tell us what you think we would, you know, we're the first to to be bold enough to open this up publicly for everybody to use which shows you just the maturity of our offering where we're confident this is gonna work for you so please just take advantage of it. It's free to get started. You're gonna have two weeks of free investigations and then we're. You're just gonna pay as you go, so it's very, uh, no commitment. Just go consume it through the Amazon marketplace, and we would love to just hear your feedback. So we're at booth 1219 if you wanna learn more, we've got, we're there, we've got a cafe, uh, behind the Data Dog slide where, uh, a lot of us are hanging out and it's, you'll see the new bird branding there and, uh, come and see us and we'd love to. Speak to you about what your vision is and how we can help you get there. Thank you very much, enjoy the show.
