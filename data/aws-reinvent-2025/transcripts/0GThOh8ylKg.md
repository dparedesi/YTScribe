  Charlie Cartwright presents Amazon QuickSuite as a unified agentic AI workspace that connects to data warehouses (Redshift, Snowflake), document stores (Google Drive, OneDrive), and business apps (Salesforce, Jira, ServiceNow, Asana) to eliminate context-switching and deliver “teammates” for insights, analysis, research, and automation. The Insight Assistant reasons across dashboards, documents, apps, and the web to answer questions like “What are our product feature gaps?” by combining telemetry, CRM, roadmap, and competitive intel. Chat-with-your-data lets users peel beyond dashboards to the underlying datasets in natural language instead of filing BI tickets. A Research Agent proposes an outline, runs multi-source, cited reports in ~25 minutes, accepts inline comments, and reruns with expanded context that becomes living knowledge inside QuickSuite. Automation spans routine flows (e.g., summarizing open email/chat threads and nudging owners) to complex RPA-style processes via Flow and Automate, with natural-language workflow design, MCP-based integrations, scheduling, and human-in-the-loop approvals; internal teams cut weekly business review prep by 90% using Flow. QuickSuite surfaces in chat, email, Microsoft Word, and via a browser extension that rides along any site to inject corporate context and ingest relevant content. Future direction emphasizes autonomous agents working goals-first with humans orchestrating teams of agents rather than single prompt/response tools, making productivity hinge on agent-human coordination.
  
  Customer stories: Propulse Lab (operations-as-a-service for AI startups) processes 1,600+ monthly tickets with 80% handle-time reduction, saving ~24,000 agent hours. Principal Financial Group uses QuickSuite’s research agent for complex product and market analyses and leverages Q Automate + MCP to build multi-agent workflows, reframing analysts as “humans with AI” rather than fearing replacement. Jabil (contract manufacturer) automates RFQ processing and quality steps, cutting scrap ~10% (~$400k/year), and shifts from static dashboards to NL-driven analytics so each user asks what they need. Vertiv (data center cooling/hardware) uses conversational analytics, Q Automate for QC checks and documentation around liquid-cooling systems, and plans a 25% user expansion in 2026. Internal AWS teams also automated weekly business reviews via Flow, reporting 90% effort reduction, and QuickSuite adoption is growing across APJ, China, Americas, and EMEA logos.
  
  Nitin from 3M describes deploying QuickSuite to support 1,700 sales reps and ~100k annual one-on-ones across a $30B multi-division business with 135k+ patents, 110+ plants, and research teams averaging MIT PhDs. Goal: sales/marketing excellence focused on retention and coaching. Quick actions plus the browser plug-in unify CRM, product sites, and internal systems so reps can plan, prep for technically complex customer meetings, analyze data, and compare products while managers get tailored coaching views. QuickSuite delivers behavioral interventions by combining ML insights, gen BI, and agentic actions, now a core piece of 3M’s low-code AI stack atop Bedrock and existing data platforms. The top-down, process-first approach speeds AI rollout without spawning a sprawl of single-purpose chatbots.

Good morning and welcome to Reinvent 2025. I'm Charlie Cartwright, and I have the pleasure of building AI applications that change the way people work, helping them make faster and better decisions. And that's what we're gonna talk about, talk about today with Amazon QuickSuite. I'll be joined by Michael, and he's gonna share some customer success stories using Amazon QuickSuite today. And then Nit will jump on stage and talk to us about 3M's AI journey and how they're using Amazon QuickSuite to support in the AI transformation. As you can see, we have a packed agenda. I'm gonna get right into it. OK, so we're all here because we understand AI is gonna fundamentally change the way we work, and we've all had those wow and delight moments in consumer AI tools where they, they've taken the world by storm over the last few years, and it's been remarkable to have access to so much information consolidated and in a seemingly like perfect format for you to digest and consume, you know, whether you're trying to figure out the next refrigerator to buy. These AI tools have been impressive in our personal lives. I use several of them frequently, and I cannot get enough of the benefit and the value, but I want that same magic in the workplace. And if your experience is anything like mine, The AI tools that I've previously had access to fall well short of that. They tend to offer point in time solutions, and they're very good at helping me maybe transform that email or do something in a specific ecosystem, but that's not the way we work. We work across a bunch of different applications and documents. And the AI tools that we have today fall well short, and it tends to be just one more application that we have to juggle. And that's why we built Amazon Quick Suite. Amazon Quick Seed is an agentic AI experience that's going to reimagine the way people work. So Let's take a step back and and uh talk a little bit about what happens today and we've observed business users knowledge workers and the way they even to do simple tasks they spend so much time just collecting information if you think about this journey to act on a decision. If it's, you know, just assume it's like this, most of that time hours and hours are spent just gathering information, and there's several reasons for that. That information lives and exists across so many different resources that are siloed, whether it's documents, data, websites, and so so much of our time is spent collecting information and we spend very little time in the differentiated capacity on those dimensions where we can really make a difference. And this is unfortunate. It's unfortunate for us as employees and it's unfortunate for organizations. Because we have lengthy, slow, and suboptimal decision making process as a result. I mean, think how hard it is to have complete information to make a decision and how long that would take you. And so what we often have to do is stop that part short so we can get to act and analyze all the information and then make a decision. And that's something with Amazon Quick Suite. That we've addressed So Amazon QuickS Suite delivers on that promise of delight. And we do this with a single unified experience. So at the foundation of Amazon QuickSuite we connect to all your, your data, your documents. In all the applications that you use on a daily basis. And we do that in one unified experience, so no more do users have to juggle across 1012, 15 applications to gather the information and make a decision about a task. And this is not just another AI tool. It's a fundamentally different approach. You can think about Amazon Quick as having this, these like agentic teammates always at your side that have information. That you need to everything that matters most so you can think about it like an insights agent, a data analyst, a PhD level researcher, and an automation expert that are with you and have all the context and information that matters most for how you do work. Now, at the heart of this. And for these agents To do interesting things and to really bring that context and bring that magic to the workplace. We need to be connected, connected to. Data warehouses and data lakes like Redshift and Snowflake, document repositories like Google Drive and OneDrive, and applications that folks use on a daily basis like Asana, ServiceNow, Jira, and Salesforce. Quick has over 50 built-in applications and access to over 1000 through partners. And now you can see this information ecosystem that's building and that prevents. And create scenarios where users no longer have to juggle across all these applications to get the information, but it's this context that empowers humans to make faster and better decisions, but it's the same context that agents require that helps them go far beyond model knowledge and provide real utility to the things that you do on a daily basis. Now let's go in a little bit deeper and show you how teams are actually using these agentic capabilities. So I'll start with Quick's Insight Assistant. Um, the interesting thing about this is Quick's Insight Assistant is able to reason across all of these resources, remember, across, across your data, your dashboards, your documents, your applications, and various websites. And it's able to identify the relevant information and passages that you need most based on the query, based on the question that you have. If we take an example, say you're a product leader. And you're trying to figure out, OK, what, what are the product feature gaps that we have with product X. Typically what you might do today is you might look at various like business dashboards that you have and look at adoption and you might look at usage and user feedback qualitative quantitative you may have um product feature requests coming in from your CRM from the field. And then you couple that with web search where you go canvass the Internet and look at various competitors and the features that they have and try to understand is this an impressive demo or is this a real feature that users are excited about. With Quick Sweet, that changes. I have to ask a simple question in natural language. Help me understand our product feature gaps of product X. And it'll pull those relevant resources, that information across your data, your documents. Consider my roadmap in doing so, because there's several of these things that we may be addressing in the near future. And something that would take you hours before you can do in seconds with QuickSweet. Now think about a couple of slides ago and we were talking about folks juggling all those applications trying to connect information from all those resources, right? And so much of their time is spent just in information collection. Now with QuickSuite folks can operate at the speed of thought and we're basing flipping this on its head, right? And so now instead of spending so much time gathering information right from thought gathering so much information to then being able to analyze that information and make a decision, now when you have a thought or an idea you can use Amazon QuickSuite and skip that information collection and phase and get right into insights and be able to take action. And then of course automate some of those actions that we'll get into a little bit later. Another gentic capability, this one is my favorite. Um, and, and, and that is the ability to chat with your data. Within Quick Quicksight you can build dashboards and it's great to have the ability to be able to chat with those dashboards or ask a question about your business and and from information to be able to pull from those dashboards. And use that in a response with context about your strategic documents, your road maps, various things about the information that you utilize on a daily and weekly basis. But what's more interesting about this. Is a lot of times the, you know, things change and the information that you need today may not be readily present on that dashboard. This tends to be the case with me and when we were launching Amazon Quick Suite. This was absolutely the case. There were information that we wanted to see like certain segments, cohort cohorts, personas. We wanna see the data split differently, and it wasn't readily available. And to be able to ask questions about your data and go beyond what's visible to the underlying data set to query that and get novel insights, that's the power of Amazon QuickSuite. And previously, like think about that for a second. If you were to have information you're trying to peel the onion a little bit and go beyond what's visible, you would write sequel yourself, right? Kind of familiarize yourself with the columns, the fields. OK, what does this mean? Probably consult with somebody, do I have this right, validate it, or you would, uh. Call a business intelligence engineer, right? And, and that's typically what I was doing. I would walk down the hall hey this is great, can we see this split this way? And now with QuickSuite you're able to generate the, the insight that information and peel that onion back and see it in a contextually rich way that is not just data but has the information in context that's meaningful and valuable to the way that you see your business. And Quick is learning over time, so as you continue to use Quick, this context is building, and again that's what's empowering these agents to act on your behalf. So again like sticking with that theme you're seeing the the the speed going from going from uh you know thought to action being able to operate at the speed of thought with Amazon Quick Suite. Another gente teammate. Um, Like some of the examples I described are are great, but you know sometimes business have like very strategic questions that they may need to answer like a firm may be considering an acquisition target. And that requires like a different level of depth and reasoning, right? Or if you're trying to look at a comprehensive competitive landscape and evaluate that uh numerous dimensions, numerous competitors, um, and for that Amazon Quick has a research agent. And so if we take the competitive landscape example in natural language. Let me get that going in natural language you can ask a question help me understand um. The competitive landscape for, you know, enterprise agentic AI applications across these six dimensions and include these competitors and if I'm missing any dimensions, please add those and if I'm missing any relevant competitors, please add those into the consideration set. And what quick research will do is it'll generate an outline for you in seconds. You can look at that outline in natural language, you can adjust things, you can add things, and then you hit run. And then 25 minutes later you'll receive a notification. And in that notification your research report will be done. This will be a comprehensive competitive landscape analysis which has evaluated all those competitors across all of those dimensions. One of the things I really like about this, like, yes, it's full with citations so you can see where statements are made, where conclusions were made, you can see the source of that information. But you can take and highlight. Specific, um, sections of that document, specific words, speci specific statistics, and you can comment throughout the document. And then you can rerun the research. And it doesn't just take the context, the agent doesn't just take the context that it had in the initial run. It'll look at your comments. It'll look at your questions, and then figure out are there are there different or additional information and context that I need to bring in to better support the user's request. And then Now that you have this research report. That is available context into QuickS Suite. So the next time I ask that first question, hey, help me identify some of our product gaps, some of our product feature gaps, now this is living context that can be deposited into Quick and so you're continuing to build that context engine like a flywheel. Um, the 4th agentic capability that I'll talk about today. Is automation. Within QuickSuite, uh, folks are able to automate work flows on a spectrum, so you can think of like more routine work flows that folks maybe do on a daily and weekly basis, but then also extremely complex work flows. Like robotic process automation that tend to span tens or hundreds of steps involving many internal systems and external systems. And with Quick you're able to automate these work flows and so like an example of that might be let's just say that you receive a lot of chat communication, a lot of email communication, and in the morning you simply want to understand the threads that are open, the threads that don't have closure to them or where there's action items outstanding. So you can create a workflow. Which is connected to your email application, which is connected to your chat applications that will go get that information. And create for you a list of things that are open, where it stands, where it stands, and who has the next action for that. And then you can set up instructions as part of that work flow based on um what the open items are to you know Slack message or email folks on your team to follow up and address some of those things. And if it's something you do on a regular basis you can schedule it so you can do this every morning at 7:45 a.m. or if you have teams that work in different parts of the country and you're trying to catch up quickly while while you were asleep and there were a lot of things happening um on on that side of the business, one of my favorite examples and this is one of our partner teams. They um used uh flows within Quick, which is one of the automation capabilities to basically automate their weekly business review and so this is pulling information internally using Adobe Analytics and various other dashboards in Quicksight in addition to, um, marketing launch events and activities and campaign performance and. The team reports that they've been able to reduce the effort that they put in to creating and maintaining that weekly business review in 10 by 90%. And so what are they doing now? The team are spending more time focused on the differentiation, the things that matter most, and they're no longer just collecting information and moving bits from one application to another application. And then for these more complex enterprise automation use cases we have a capability called automate. And in Automate you can use natural language to build out a workflow and it'll spin up agents for those workflow steps that are non-deterministic that require uh agentic capabilities and you can also upload a process document and create an extensive workflow. Um, and then it also comes with like a build, test, and deploy environment. The thing that's most impressive about this is, um, you know, as you're building out these enterprise automation workflows, they're often nominal situations where maybe you need a human in the loop to help disambiguate something or you want to set a human as the approver if a policy reaches over 10,000 in premium or something like that. Um, you can set those criteria and have a human be in the loop to set that approval, and the rest of the workflow can continue going, uh, go, all right. So of course as a product leader in the Amazon Quick Suite team I would love it if everyone started, worked through their day, and ended their day in Amazon Quick Suite, which to me is this amazing unified agentic experience which brings all of your data, documents, applications, and web search into one place. But I understand that's not reality, and folks work in various applications. And so that's why we make QuickSuite available where you work and help accelerate and improve the productivity in the applications that you work in. So whether it's popular chat applications, email applications, Microsoft Word, Quick is available working alongside of you in those applications, bringing that same context into those applications. So that you're able to ask questions, generate insights, information. And accelerate your work. Quick also has a browser extension. And that browser extension travels with you across all the sites that you visit internally and externally. And it's able to ingest that information and again couple that with all the information, all the context that Quick has. So not only can you ask information about what's in front of you. But you can get additional insights by bringing in that context that Quick has access to and knitting with 3M we'll go into more detail on how the 3M team is using um Quick's browser extension. OK, I'm gonna spend a little bit of time on the future. The, the reality is I have no idea what is to come, and that's the beauty of AI, um, but one thing, one theme of everything I discussed today, it all started like the, the human was the catalyst, right, the user, it's me, it's you going in and putting in a question, entering a prompt, getting a response back, yeah, we've significantly shortened the time it takes to gather that information. And you can automate those tasks through integrations of all these applications. But what we're gonna see when you bring together um AI and context is real autonomy and automation. So these agents are capable of acting with true agency. And with QuickSuite we'll be able to enable them to do that so folks can work in concert with real agentic teammates that have goals and can act with autonomy and complete tasks independent of me putting out a request or asking for something to be done and we expect like. Productivity will be measured in the future, how well one can orchestrate. Across a team of humans and agents. Um, with that, I'm gonna turn it over to Michael to talk through customer success stories. Michael, thanks, Charlie. Thank you very much, good job. Hello everyone, good morning. My name is Michael Armentano. Uh, thank you so much for coming today. We appreciate your presence. We wouldn't be able to do any of this without you, of course. Um, I am based in Singapore. I look after our, uh, go to market and business development capability for QuickS Suite covering APJ and China. So, uh, it's a big territory and there is a lot of, uh, air miles involved, um, but I'm happy to be here today in Las Vegas to talk to you about some of our customer case studies. And of course um we have the distinct honor of having one of our customers with us, Nitin from 3M who's gonna give you a little bit of detail. So we have a couple of the customers highlighted here um as you can see uh there are some things I wanna say before we talk about the actual customer use cases um many of you have probably heard as I have a lot of chatter in the press about AI bubble and AI replacing humans and all these kinds of things. So I don't know what's what that, you know, end state is gonna look like, but what I like to do is when I start these kinds of talks, uh, anchor to a statement which has been made very many times by very many people. In this case I'm gonna quote, um, Doctor Laconi from Harvard Business School who said AI is not going to replace humans, but humans with AI will replace humans without AI. So the reason why I like to talk about that, especially when it comes to customer case studies, is a lot of people are talking about whether or not AI projects are successful, whether or not, you know, the money spent was worth it, and whether or not we can measure outcomes. The 4 customers that I'm gonna talk to you about, and of course our 5th customer 3M, will tell you about measurable outcomes of these projects using technology like QuickSuite to achieve these outcomes, but what are the most important outcomes? The most important outcomes in my mind, uh, boil down to two KPIs. KPI number 1 is how do we make people more efficient? So in the spirit of becoming humans with AI, how do we make people more efficient so that they are those humans with AI and therefore will outperform humans without AI? Number 2, how do we cast a wider net so that more people can become humans with AI. And uh of course also be more efficient, but more people get insights and and the ability to basically just ask questions and get answers of their data. So at the end of the day, everything that we're doing anchors back to those two key performance metrics. We wanna make people more efficient whether you're a data engineer, whether you're a business analyst, whether you're a data analyst, whether your job is looking at dashboards. Uh, whether your job is cobbling together data into an Excel spreadsheet so you can answer an executive's question, all of those things we wanna make you more efficient at doing that, and we wanna cast a wider net so more people are able to do that. Um, that's gonna be the key theme of these customer, uh, case studies. So we currently have, because of the fact that, um, many of you have probably heard of Amazon Quick Site, uh, this became part of QuickSuite. So QuickSite is included in QuickSuite. And we currently have over 100,000 customers worldwide. I have been fortunate enough to be able to talk to many of them in Asia. Uh, and you can see some of our logos here, um, on the slide. So we have them worldwide, uh, of course Asia Pacific, Japan, China, um, of course all over North America, South America, and MAA as well. So this first case study is actually really interesting I think. So many of you may not have heard of this company called Propulse Lab, but basically this is a company that's based in Switzerland, uh, and you know Switzerland's not really known for being a hotbed of innovation. Some might actually say it's a conservative country, right? Uh, for example, the banking system is well known for not being extremely innovative but very conservative. However, what they're doing here is actually quite amazing. So, basically what they're doing is they're saying, hey, we recognize that there's going to be tons and tons of AI startups, and those startups are going to need operations. They're gonna need legal, they're gonna need finance, they're gonna need HR. And so what we're gonna do is basically provide those as a service. So just like AWS provides our customers infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, software as a service, and these other things, Propulse is basically saying, hey, we're gonna provide operations as a service. So clearly, the more efficient they can be, the better it is for them. The more, uh, basically their bottom line grows by how efficient they can be. They're using QuickSight, as you can see, Quick Suite, as you can see here, uh, to basically process over 1600 monthly tickets with an 80% reduction in average handle time, saving over 24,000 agent hours annually. So this goes back exactly to the agent scenario that Charlie talked about. They basically have agents working for them, which are of course AI agents, enabling them to save up to 24,000 hours annually, and of course pass that savings on to their customer and enable this new generation of startups to not have to invest in HR teams, finance teams, etc. etc. So very, very cool use case. The second one here is Principal Financial Group. So probably not many of you heard of ProPulse just because of the fact that they're based in, uh, Switzerland and they're, you know, uh, very much kind of focused on the startup industry, but I would bet that all of you have heard of Principal Financial Group, right? Massive financial group with a major presence worldwide. Um, there are a couple of things that they're doing here that are actually very interesting. The first is, clearly, if you're a financial group, you have a lot of data analysts and a lot of market analysts, right? And to Charlie's point either, uh, earlier, if you can have an agentic data analyst or an agentic researcher for you, you can use that to become a human with AI and save a lot of time. And that's exactly what they're doing. Basically for all kinds of complex research projects that they're taking on, whether it's consumer facing research, whether it's analysts making recommendations on. You know, investment, um, uh, retirement investment options, or whether it's research on internal products that they will then sell to their customers, they're using QuickSuite's, uh, agentic research capability, this research agent that Charlie talked about to greatly, uh, reduce the amount of time and effort it takes to do research. If you think about how you do research, it's not easy, right? You have to gather a lot of data, right? You have to figure out, um, what are the sources that you trust. You have to create citations. You have to put that in some format, right? So that then you have to figure out who's my audience. Is it an executive? Maybe I need to be very succinct if it's an executive. Is it perhaps, you know, someone who wants 60 page and wants to read a whole syllabus? You have to do all that work. What we're trying to do is say, and what principal is trying to do is say, hey. You're still gonna be a data analyst, you're still gonna be a research analyst, but you're gonna have this agent that works for you and does some of the lower value work so you can focus on the higher value work, thereby becoming a human with AI. Uh, the other thing that they're doing here, which is really interesting and um, uh, I think Charlie really mentioned it already in the automate capability within QuickSuite, um, but that is that they are integrating via MCP. They're creating multi-genic workflows, OK? So the idea is not only do they have an agent that goes off and does research for them and comes back, but they're also able to uh make their core business processes more efficient by building out multi-agenttic systems and they do that with QAutomate and the ability to integrate through MCP to other agents to other pieces of software that do tasks, right? So really what we're seeing here is a, is a movement. From a single agentic world where customers are using one agent for one task, another agent for another task, to a multi-agenttic world where we have complex workflows with agents talking to one another, replacing entire business processes. And that's done through QAutomate within QuickSuite. Third one, JBL. Many of you may not have heard of JBL. It's a massive American company. Um, I've been to their headquarters actually many times, uh, in a previous life in Tampa or Saint Petersburg. Um, and essentially what they do is. They manufacture much of the equipment that uh uh that is needed for transistor uh manufacturing companies. So they're also able to uh use Q Automate to to achieve a very specific purpose and that is to optimize the RFQ process ref uh request for quote, right? So they have many, many suppliers. They have a very, very complex supply chain, and they have tons of quotations coming in and requests for quotations, and they're always looking to, of course, optimize that in some way. So, what they're able to do is use QAutomate and essentially uh automate most of the most important, uh, uh, I'm sorry, the easiest processes and leave the most important for actual humans. Uh, you heard Charlie mention that that's human in the loop. So with Q Automate, what they can do is they can kind of automate through agentic AI some of the low hanging fruit, some of the low value workload, and then have a step in that workflow that says, hey, for this important decision that needs to be taken, we're gonna need a human in the loop, right? And doing that, um, they're able to reduce scrap by about 10%, so that's actual material scrap, uh, saving about 400,000, uh, every, every year. The other thing that they're doing here, which is really interesting is They use Quicksight for dashboards. Many of you have probably used Quicksight. Uh, all of you have probably used dashboards. Um, what we see very much as the future of dashboards is, the future is dark for dashboards, right? We have dashboards, we know people will use dashboards, but a dashboard was one dashboard built for many people. So maybe I create a dashboard for all of you. But each one of you has a different thing that you wanna see on that dashboard, so I have to anticipate as a builder, I have to figure out, hey, what does this person wanna see? What does that person wanna see? You even heard heard Charlie say that when he needs to ask a question about a dashboard, he goes down the hall and talks to one of his colleagues and says, hey, can you help me out with this? What we wanna do is flip the script entirely. We wanna say, hey, instead of a dashboard driven approach, we want a language driven approach. We want an AI driven approach. What that means is you come into the office instead of looking at a dashboard, you just ask the question that you wanna ask. We call that natural language processing or natural language query. We have that infused into Quick Suite in many different ways. Number one is just straight in dashboards. So you can just ask a question about your data. You can say, how many products did I sell last year? What's the forecast for sales next year? Why did sales drop in February 2024 and get answers. You also saw Charlie's show the Universal chat, or My Assistant, which allows you to do similar kinds of questions and answers of all your data. Not just BI data, but all your data, your structured data, your semi-structured data, your images, your unstructured data, your Slack data, whatever you might want, OK? Jable is also doing that. They're creating a world where their analysts come into the office, they don't look at a dashboard, they look at a search bar, and they ask a question. What happens is that each person is able to ask exactly what they want instead of relying on a dashboard that was built for many people. Much more efficient and much more interesting. All right, so the last case study I have before I bring Nitin on stage is called Vertive. Again, uh, this is an extremely important company. Uh, before I started working with them, I didn't really even understand or appreciate how important they are, but basically what they do, they're actually, uh, a huge, we're actually a huge customer of theirs. What they do is essentially provide the gear that we need in data centers to manage cooling and other things. Uh, and so one of the main innovations is they have technology which has allowed them to go from, or us even to go from air cooling data centers and chips to liquid cooling data centers and chips, right? So obviously when you have liquid and electronics together, it's not really a natural fit, so you have to figure out how to manage that and they've been able to do that. So they have some very interesting technology about. Um, you know, how, uh, how to manage heat within a data center. Uh, one of their biggest customers is also Nvidia. Of course, Nvidia manufacturing GPUs, generating tons of heat, and, uh, needs to be managed, right? There's more heat than ever in these data centers because of GPUs, uh, and they have this technology that allows them to manage that, uh, extremely efficiently. So they're also using QuickSuite, uh, many different capabilities of QuickSuite. They're using the conversational analytics that we talked about before. They're using QAutomate to go through some of their quality control checks, to automate some of the easier steps for their quality control checks, and also, uh, generating documentation for some of these new products that they, that they bring out within the liquid cooling sphere. All right? And you can see the quote here from the VP of data and analytics. They're looking at scaling out users by 25% more in 2026, right? So they're going from their current footprint to +25% in 2026, and we hope that they will continue to grow, uh, and, uh, and use QuickSweet. Alright, so with that, I would like to uh introduce Nitin who is the VP of data and analytics for 3M. It's a distinct honor for me to be able to do that. We thank you very much, Nitin for that and uh hope you enjoy the rest of Reinvent. Thank you. Thanks, Michael. Appreciate it. Thank you Michael and Charlie. I mean, great introduction to the product and what I'm hoping to do a little bit of here is to kind of share some context on, um, you know, kind of what goes behind implementing, you know, QuickSuite and, and, and getting value out of it, right? Um, so let's maybe jump in quickly. Let me give you a little bit of context to 3M because this is important, uh, in highlighting Quick as a solution of choice for us in driving, you know, AI and automation across the company. We always say at 3M that you're about 10 ft away from a 3M product no matter where you are in the world. Whether you're in a car, whether you're, you know, using your cell phone, uh, whether, you know, you're putting a diaper on a child, whether you're on the moon, doesn't matter. You're about 10 ft away from a 3M product, and we do that across our safety and industrial business, our transportation and electronics business, and the consumer business which probably many are familiar with with Scotch Pride and Postted and so on. But more importantly, it's across the scale of 63,000 people. And many of these are some of the smartest individuals on the planet. Our average R&D researcher is an MIT PhD. Right, aside from that, it's a cross proprietary data stretching across more than 135,000 patents, so it makes for a very interesting and complex data situation and of course scale, you know, we operate across more than 110 manufacturing sites spread globally. So data and AI at 3M is complicated, right? And that's one of the reasons why when we focus on driving data and AI strategy at 3M, we focus more on a top down approach of picking strategic objectives we wanna go after and then starting to figure out how we leverage data and AI to drive a business outcome, right? So one of the programs that we've talked about quite a bit has been 3M excellence. And 3M excellence is about sales and marketing excellence that we wanted to drive. And this is across the spectrum of our customer life cycle from acquisition to growth to retention. And we'd identified retention as a clear opportunity for us and we talked about that in our Q1 investor calls when we said we're gonna start using AI and ML to drive insights which allow us to help work with our customers better. But over the course of that implementation from Q1 to Q4, we started to realize that just the insight alone is not enough. We have to get to behavioral interventions that actually help our sales teams, you know, work with our customers better. And that's why as we started to get to Q4, we started to talk about our focus on the coaching conversations, the one on one conversations that our sales managers are having with sales teams. So as we put together the strategy, you know, we had to work across 1700 sales reps. Across more than 100,000 1 on one conversations that the sales team was driving over a year, and we wanted to drive better insights into these conversations. So the idea of leveraging the insights from the AIML model, creating insights for coaching with generative AI. Achieving better planning with generative BI or generative insights, and then finally leveraging agentic AI to drive actions. So that was essentially the challenge that we were working through. Now as we work through these challenges, and this is hopefully something that you can take back to your own workplaces to think about how you drive AI strategy, right? Whenever we look at a business process, the first part of what we do from a product management perspective is to lay out the business process and start to look at all the opportunities that can come out of that business process, right? So usually it's not a bottom up approach where we identify a use case and go right after it with an experiment. Rather we look at the entire process and then we look at AI as adding value in three ways. First, are there workflows that we can automate. Other insights that we can generate and is there knowledge that we can aggregate. So as we analyzed the sales process what we started to realize was the benchmark about sales teams were true. Our sales teams were spending an inordinate amount of time trying to bring together data from different sources and use that effectively, right. So we started to focus our attention on that area and we started to look at solutions, and that was when we got in touch with the AWS team and we we had the joy of being an early partner on the Quake program. So as we started looking at the Quick program, we wanted to leverage several of the key features of the Quick Suite, right? The first one of course was we want to leverage quick actions because we had to bring together data and information from multiple sources. But the second part of it was we'd already created many chatbots, you know, uh, prior to this, but what that resulted was a fragmented experience because we were having, you know, the sales team having to go to different applications and use different tools and so what made the solution so valuable for us was the browser plug-in because now we had one unified experience where we could bring actions together. But that actions could also change according to the context of what the user was using, whether they were looking at a CRM system, whether they were looking at product data on a website, they could bring all of these insights together into a coherent experience. So as we started looking at what we needed to do with our sales teams, we started to realize that we had to push the boundaries of how we were looking at AI and we were able to do that quite a bit with QuickSuite because when we started to think about a comprehensive way in which we could actually create these behavioral interventions that allowed our sales team to leverage these insights effectively, first part was we had to look at personas, so we have the sales team member and then we have the leader. The sales team member needed to plan and ensure that they understood how effective that their plan was. They needed to prep for customer meetings. We're talking about you know, complicated material science solutions over here and the prep required with customers is quite intense. They also needed to analyze vast amounts of data and bring that together across multiple systems and finally of course as I said, we have a very complicated set of products and so we needed a product analysis feature and a system that would help with comparing different products and advocating the right solutions and across all of this, so this is with one sales team member now we needed the sales leader to be able to bring all of this information together. Across multiple sales team members and create a coaching experience so they could focus on individualized coaching communications with each team member during one on one conversations. So if you kind of think about this, we were able to absorb all of this into a cohesive singular experience with a browser plug-in, but we were able to leverage quick to connect with a disparate set of systems across the board to be able to deliver that coherent experience. So from bringing the insights together from analyzing the effectiveness of plans, from, you know, researching um for customer meeting uh preparation. To analyze data as you were, you know, kind of having these conversations with customers and finally bringing that together into a cohesive, uh, coaching conversation, it's been a super successful experience for us and we're absolutely thrilled to continue to expand with the Quick Sue. And of course you know there is a technical stack behind it, right? But as we've looked at it, Quick has become an integral part of our AI stack as we start looking at business outcomes, agentic product and agentic experiences that we wanna drive, Quick. Now become an integral part of our low code no code experience, right? So as our platform teams think about creating blueprints and trying to democratize that across the company we're leveraging Quick as a mechanism, a Quick suite as a mechanism to be able to do that. So while the, the stack, the competence, the constants of the way we think about the stack remains constant. You know this evolution from Bedrock to now using QuickSuite in our stack, you know, has been a big change and a big accelerator for us. So again, thank you to the AWS team. It's been an absolute thrill and of course from a 3M standpoint it's been able to great, it's been great to serve our customers better now, uh, with a faster way to deploy AI across these complicated scenarios. Thank you for your time today and yeah, thanks for making it for the session. Thank you everyone, thank you. Um, I think we're done with the presentation. I'm happy to stick around. I think we have, uh, some of the other speakers that can stick around for a few minutes as well if there are any questions. Thank you very much for your time and enjoy, uh, reinvent 2025.
