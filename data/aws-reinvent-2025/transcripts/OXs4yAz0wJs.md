Hello, good afternoon. Thank you for making time to come join me to talk about, as you can see from the title slide, reimagining business processes with dual agents. I'm Walter Sun, and, uh, I lead the AI product engineering team at SAP. So just to give you, uh, put everyone on the same, on the same page, I just wanna share a high level diagram of what we do in business AI at SAP. I'll start bottoms up. At the bottom is applications. Uh, for those of you not familiar with SAP. We have products across all lines of businesses like human capital management. We have SuccessFactors for travel, we have Concur, for procurement, we have Ariba, and then for ERP we have S4, which is used by most of the Fortune 500 companies. All this is supported with embedded AI features. And so we build features that come out of the box. If you get business OCR you get document understanding when you scan a receipt for Concur, that comes from AI. That's kind of embedded in all the solutions. What we've done is we've gone a step beyond that and I'll talk about that today with Juul. Above that, first of all, the data layer. We have a product called the Business Data Cloud. This product is to allow you to bring all your data to one place and by virtue of it being in the same place allows you to get insights across all your lines of businesses at one place. And above that is all the AI that we built on top. So Jewel, as I mentioned, is our AI co-pilot, if you're not familiar with that. And the idea with Juul is that It connects with natural language to each of your business processes. And the beauty of that is it makes it quick and easy for new hires. They say a new hire at your company and you use SAP, they can use natural language to execute without needing needing to understand the OS very well or or the the the UX very well. And so for instance, if you say, You join and you wanna take a vacation for the holidays. It's December now. Say, I wanna take 3 days of vacation before Christmas. You can do that with natural language in JUUL, and it goes into SuccessFactors and makes that change for you rather than you understanding where you need to go. So that actually is kind of the first step of JUUL, natural language to processes, right, and actions. Uh, Beyond that, you know, is agents, and agents is a big topic. You heard Matt Garman talk a lot about this morning. We'll talk more about it today as well and how we are using it at SAP. But with that, each of the lines of business, as you see here, finance, procurement, supply chain, each of them have agents that you can interact with. The additional value is that these agents can interact across different lines of businesses, and that's kind of the value add of having SAP having applications across all lines. For instance, if you are, let's say a business person and you wanted to figure out how to Book a trip for to visit your top clients, you would have to access your CRM tool, which we have a product called CX. And then once you find that information, you would actually go to a travel tool which would be Concur. And so with multi-agent communication, you can do all that in one place. And I'll talk a little bit about how all that works. But I'll first kind of mention like The motivation, right? You know, we all talk about agents. Everyone talks about agents. How do I motivate? How do we motivate this, this topic in case you're not convinced this is valuable? If you go 15 years ago, or maybe even 10 years ago, you might go on a trip, let's say you're in LA, you want to come to reinvent in Vegas. You want to travel, you get a map, or you might go to AAA, your local travel company and say, give me a map and an itinerary for how to go from LA to Las Vegas, let me go to Palm Springs or whatever. And you go through this detailed map, and then you, you get it all figured out like a week before and then you leave, let's say Monday, come, come here, right? Yesterday, come here. What you do also, this is the same thing you do with applications. In the past, as I mentioned, if you want to book a, I'll use this example again and again. If you want to take, visit your top customers, um, you actually would first find out who they are. So you go to your CRM tool, you find out who they are, and then you say, OK, you talk to your administrator or somebody or a travel agent, say, I need to actually book trips to these locations. How I make it work, right? So the idea is you plan ahead, and then you execute, right? With agents, you can actually do it basically in real time. The same way you do. Travel now with GPS, right? So you go on, let's say if you were from in LA and you wanted to come to Las Vegas, you would probably not even need to spend days and days planning. You would just say, I'll put in my GPS, we'll see what happens. And that's not actually even worse. It's actually even better than it was 1015 years ago because 1015 years ago, you plan it 2 weeks ago, and then let's say a road closes like over Thanksgiving. You don't know that, you get stuck, right? GPS gives you real-time traffic, real-time conditions, and it can readjust you in the same way. By the same token, this example I gave you for agents, maybe two weeks ago, you figure out who your top 5 customers are. Customers A, B, C, and D, and you also want to bring a couple of your, your, your your colleagues along, Jane and John. But by the time you travel, maybe John's transferred to a different division, maybe one of your top 5 customers is out of town, maybe customer A happens to be a reinvent and they can't meet with you. So You actually have the ability to use agents that dynamically also adapt to the needs as well. So it's a very analogy I like is that basically You, we all know how we used the maps before and how we do maps now. For many of you who haven't started using agents, you do a lot of things manually now, piece by piece. In the future, you can use agents to do them all together and also dynamically in a way that actually is optimal as well. And so the question is, why are agents special? I think the first thing is the idea of reasoning. A lot of people aren't super comfortable with the idea that machines or systems can reason, right? But the reality is that, you know, having this ability Brings a lot more power. The same reason idea if you hire, I use the analogy that agents are like junior assistants that you hire. You hire a college graduate, the first few days or a few months they're on a job, you don't want them to think on their own too much because it's risky and things can happen. So you tell them what to do and you follow them closely, right? But after time you let them do their own thing. And so the idea is that you let them reason later. Initially you don't let them reason at all, right? And this is the same with machines. You know, in the past, we don't let them reason. We just say, here's task A, task B, task C, complete that, right? A, give me a list of top customers, I have that. B, giving these customers, find me flights to these locations, right? Now you can say, these agents can actually reason and say, if you want to know who your top customers are and you want to visit them, you can contact a travel agent, which is Concur for us. And beyond that, these, these, these agents also can reason about what's logical. I'm not gonna book 4 trips to Chicago. New York, Los Angeles, and San Fran and Miami the same day because it's not logical, right? These systems I've learned basic logic of mapping and locations and these type of things can help you apply logic and, and, and get the right answer. And this is just an easy example of visually map, you know, geo mapping, but this actually works in complex business processes as well. These models are trained on so much data and so much information that you know what's logical, what's log logical. If you wanna, let's say, buy a ton of inventory from. From Asia over Black Friday and ship it and get it ready for the holidays, the system will tell you in the past, other companies have tried this, it's not worked out too well, right? It takes many more, much more longer because of weather conditions are worse in the fall, late fall. Uh, people are all, all buying inventory at that time. So basically, these systems can help correct errors that you don't know. And the idea is that it can plan, it can also take action as well. And all of this is kind of the new age of what's happening, and it makes it a lot easier for us to get things done. And so I talked a little bit about what we do, but, you know, the very first slide, I, I, I gave a quick overview of the application layer, the data layer, and the dual agents. But I think the point I guess I want to talk about at the top is that these agents Iterrate on themselves and we also have analytics agents as well. These analytics agents can analyze how your agents are performing, making sure you do better. We have RPA agents to help you automate as well. We have also system trigger agents that you can follow rules so that these aren't reactive agents, but they're proactive as well, meaning that you can say, hey, whenever I get an email from our CEO, do X, Y, and Z, versus like wait for you to use Juel or use a chat, a chat window to make, make a request. And so the idea also as I mentioned before that because we have all lines of businesses, you can actually build agents across all lines. You have data across all lines of businesses, so the systems understand all of that. And by having that full context, you get a lot more done. And beyond that, suppose you have your own, let's say an old org chart app that you built 25, 30 years ago. We have JL Studio that lets you extend and build up on top of what's in our system. So the idea is that you can extend what's available and still use JL to access more than just what's in SAP. And all this happens, this is just an example like how you can apply uh questions that actually can ask, answer very specific things in your company. Show me my sales reps my revenue. And so you get these top 5 sales reps. Obviously if you ask a large language model this, public model, you're not gonna get any information like this because there's no information about your company, right? So all of this is carefully grounded in your data. And that's an important part. I mean, I think you understand the grounding is but the idea that Language models trained on public data, but not all data you have is public. Models aren't run real-time, so you need grounding that gives you real-time data, right? If you ask about what happened in today's keynote for Matt Garmin, you need a model that has some grounding of, of news that can get that information. You also need for your company grounded information that's private. You know, you have your, let's say, the most common thing I talk about is your vacation policy. Every company has a different policy. And yours is even different from your colleagues based on how long you've been there, right? So basically, it needs to be grounded in, in what the company policies are and also needs to be grounded in your profile. All that information is provided automatically in Juul. So now I'll talk about basically our vision and, and, and goals for agents. It's basically three pronged. The first thing is we wanna make sure that there are agents available to you out of the box. So we wanna empower you with pre-built agents. But as I mentioned, you might not have everything you need already out of the box. You might have something you wanna use yourself. So we're democratizing the ability for you to develop your own agents and plug them into the system. That's the second mission. And then the third mission is that we're also not restricting you to the SAP ecosystem. We know that you may have other product providers like we're here with AWS that Reinvent. You might use, you know, agent space or other other technologies. And so the idea is that you would actually, we have this technology we apply with agent to agent that lets you work across agent technologies. And so I'll talk about that as a third mission. So starting with the first mission, we have pre-built agents, and so we've now 25 agents are available already in production, and we have 15 more going into production by the end of the year, the end of this month. And so you can sort of see a list of them. You have things like accounts receivable, dispute resolution, and as I mentioned, many of these are system triggered. Dispute resolution, you don't wanna go to the machine and say, what disputes do I have? Rather, if a dispute happens, it comes in by email, you wanna be alerted by it, right? So with these agents that are system triggered as well, um, that can act proactively to you and your needs. And here's, I'll, I'll show two examples. One is a catalog optimization agent. A lot of people who are in retail have a catalog of their inventory of items, but these inventory items update every day, right? You might have a new version of a product, you might sell a lot of a product, you might wanna transition product A to product B, you know, an equivalent. And the whole idea behind this is that it's very difficult to do this manually. And so a catalog optimization agent is an agent that helps you. Update in real time what's happening based off of your incoming orders and your outgoing sales. And so we found that by using this agent, people are reducing time to translate catalog data by 70%. And we also found that people are spending 65% less time maintaining assets, and you can imagine that's the case for a retail company if any of you are in that business. The other example is basically accounting accruals. Accruals is the idea that there's something that's kind of billed, but you're not something that's building up but you haven't been billed yet. Like you have a credit card bill you pay every month. During the month you accrue charges, right, which you can see. But in some cases you can't see it quite as readily. For instance, an example that you may see is electricity. Your electricity bill, you use electricity at home every day, and at the end of the month or so you get billed. And typically you can assume it's linear, but you know, as the weather gets colder in the fall, you might use more electricity. And so basically having an agent that helps you understand your policy, understanding historical transactions, and using that to extrapolate what your numbers are quite valuable. And I'll show you a demonstration for this, but just to show you, customers have used it on 80% time reduction in calculating the accruals and a 50% reduction in time to review the amounts and posting the entries. So I'll show you an example. This is actually the accruelest agent in action. And so it's two unprocessed accruals here. And let me just show you the first one. This one, you look into this video and I'm trying to keep it more interactive by showing a few demos. Right here you're saying, I have this one item that's not, not, not paid, not accrued yet. I wanna know what it is. And so you can sort of see the reasoning. The reasoning tells you what it's been told in the system, and I'll show you in a minute. The workflow says, go to your policy documents and figure out how we do accruals. And the way we do accruals is two things. One is you extrapolate by based on number of days, but you also have a year over year adjustment. And so that basically this accruals agent does that. And you see the flow chart here, and you see a flow chart here, as you look below is accounting policy handbook at the very bottom, the first thing. And over here you have the posted accruals as well. So basically you have your company policy as a grounding. You have your posted actual accruals, and you take the actual accruals, your policy, and the rules and come up with a new number, right? And this is kind of the recommendation. And if you're happy with the recommendation, you just say, OK, and you're done. Obviously you always have a human in the loop, so if you're not happy with the number, you can always adjust it, but it tells you with transparency how it came up with the 6325 number. Now that beyond just doing the math, you can see this other case of like looking and solving more difficult problems. This one has an error. You see the red box on top. And the problem is there's no call center applied to this particular example. So what you want to do is say, OK, let me use Jewel, which is our AI co-pilot, and ask and find out what is the, the, the call center. This happens to me a lot myself, for real. People say, Hey, Walter, can I use your call center for something? And I have a call center, but I don't know off the top of my head. Jewel knows what it is. You say, hey, help me solve this problem. This, this, this particular one doesn't have a call center. And immediately Joel says, I recommend you use at the call center for this, this value, and this value is potentially your call center. And you say, yes, do you want to do this or no? Again, you, you, you're in charge. And once you say yes, you actually get it applied and then it says, OK, now that I have it applied, everything else is fine. Should I post this accrual? And you say yes, you go ahead and you're done. And so we saw two cases we just talked about of the accruals agent. One is taking, following company policy, the other is actually fixing an error that was in the system. So that's kind of just two examples of how you can use the accruals agent. And so, the, the value of this, as I mentioned, is proactive alerting, right? You were alerted in this example, and over a course of 3 minutes, 2 or 3 minutes, we just did this together, we figured out how to solve a couple of cases. So you're proactively alerted of issues, maybe you have 1000 different cases, only 2 at an issue. You can automate these tasks, and you can sort of see a lot of this work is automated. And finally, it augments your business decision making, right? It helps you decide and fix problems quickly rather than requiring you to read through the case every time. If you can imagine, as I mentioned, I don't know if you have the same problem, but if you're asked to add your call center every time, like one time a week, you do that 50, look up information 50 times a year, a system can do that very quickly. And this is, this is one simple example of how it works. So basically that, that's kind of using the agent for business process. You can also, as I mentioned earlier, use agents to improve your processes. And so we have Signnavio, which lets you understand how your how your businesses are running. And so we have an agent, agent mining in Signnavio, a traces, it's a tracing agent for decisions and actions. It flags bottlenecks, determines if you're not compliant, and it also monitors and optimizes the value. So this is basically a workflow that lets you evaluate the processing, how your agents are doing. So I think one thing I just gonna say is that we have 5 main processes or principles for agent development. One is you wanna design for business outcomes. We're not, we don't wanna design agents that you never use, right? We wanna find agents that you need the most. And so we talk to customers, and you can also tell me and or, or anyone you know from SAP like what, what agents do you need built for our products, and that helps you get, helps us bring value to you. Accelerating kind of value. This is the whole idea that we don't, a lot of things are very arduous at work. How do you make sure you get things done more and more quickly? Streamlining the engagement through JUL. This is the point I showed you earlier and it's a demo where you actually are using JUL and engaging very quickly with, with accruals and other things without having to go through the UX taking many, many steps. Reinforcing human trust and accountability. This is important, right? Responsible AI and AI ethics are a big key part of Any kind of AI work and it's the same with AI agents. You saw in the process when we talked about accruals, we gave rules as to how we decided on the 63 €25 right? It said, hey, take the extrapolate the number of days, but also take an increase of 1% every year because of inflation or cost of cost of goods, right? And so you have full account we have full accountability and you have full trust in terms of how we're actually providing the answers to you through these systems. And lastly, I mentioned the word democratizing development. This is kind of the second principle and it kind of segues. Our fifth principle is basically how do we make it easier for you to use access agents. So the first part is accessing out of the box agents. That's hopefully easy and fast to use. If you haven't tried it, please try it out. The second thing is saying, hey, look, I actually have my own needs, but you don't, you didn't satisfy them. You showed me the 40 agents, but I don't really wanna, you know, I need something else. And so we can let you extend and build and also share that information to other people. That's doable through this product called Jewel Studio. In Jual Studio, and I'll show you another demo here, you actually are taking the third box is AI agent and Joual skills builder. And so basically you use Jual Studio to create a project. You can sort of see here you want to actually And in a matter of 2 minutes you can actually build this agent. And so the idea is you, you say, OK, create an AI agent, and then you type in what you want it for. Logistics agent is the one I'm showing you here. How do I create a logistics agent? Well, you give an explanation, and that's basically the prompting you give to the LLM on the left-hand side, saying this is how you should do it. And for logistics agents, we need to actually collect information about what packages you're looking for and then you need to give me details about, we'll give them details about what the status of the package. And so you need to add documents. And this here tells you, shows you how you can add the right information. Let's say shippers, you need to get the input from shippers, and then you create some skills. And what I have here is basically a transportation skill where you create, you see a flow chart here that's being built. And in this flow chart, we need to add different components, right? And so each component we talked about what inputs do you have? That was the first thing you did. I know it's going kind of fast, but the goal is basically, this is the sort of it is you get the inputs, basically the packages are coming in and the outputs that you want. And once you get the output, you also want to figure out like where do you get information from here. And this is transportation processes. This transportation process looks up in. Generally, the status of different packages. Like if you go to your shipper, FedEx, DHL, whatever, look up the status, and after you, after you fetch the status, you also wanna report it back so you create this this confirmation message and this message is customizable by you as well, and you type in the format you want, and now you have your flow. Once the flow is completed, you can actually double check and test it out, which is what I'll show you here. You do a test and you can say you're using JO again, and it says, this is a test case. This is looking at, um, a Juul test of logistics, and you ask, you know, find the best carrier for urgent product. And it says, give me some more details. So you say, I'm gonna ship from Chicago to Pittsburgh, and it tells you, OK, given that what you want, the recommended provider is DHL. And so you can sort of see, you can test the agent you built, and over the course of about 3 minutes of this video, you actually built a new agent to handle logistics. And so you can sort of see if you're at a company and you want to add new capabilities like this, it's very easy to do, build you on top of what you have already. So now you have a 41st agent on top of the 40 that we provide, and it's included in the library there. So that's kind of an example. Over the course of a few minutes, you can build your own agents. And so the goal behind this is that you can actually extend easily what you need to build here. So on top of that though, you say, well, let me first show you how it works. Basically by extending on this, you have our applications in the light blue at the bottom. You actually go up to the SAP building at Joel Studio which is where we showed you building your own custom agents. And now your custom agents can interact above into the purple section. You see the arrows up. You actually fully Immersed into the other agents that Joel has. So in the future, if you're using one of the JO agents, the supply chain and you ask a question about a package, it knows that you've created once you register this this logistics agent. Hey, you're actually asking about the status of a package. This logistics agents have the skills to find out what the answer is. It'll call it and give you the answer. So this is just gonna show you how you can quickly integrate into our system. So I mean I mentioned extensibility. What I showed you is the 3rd 1, custom agents, um, how you build additional agents. You actually have different ways, different levels of, of customization. From the, from the least or most simple is basically you can add configurations. You may have specific parameters you change, and you can do that. The second one is using JooStudio to add custom fields. Field extensibility may be. Like we have city, state, zip, maybe you have county you wanna add to your system. Doing that's pretty easy. A little more, more difficult is what we did here where you custom agents, which still is pretty easy to build. And finally, the far right is DuoStudios third-party agents, and this is kind of leveraging A to A. And I'll talk about that in a bit and how we, how we, we connect there. But before I do that, I wanna talk about how in the process of building agents, we can also have agents also build agents as well. And this is kind of an interesting thought of like, how do you have your agents assist you to build new agents. And what you're seeing here is basically the way it works is you, you basically create a system that you interview people that are product experts. So you ask a question that says, hey, what do you do to, to order new laptops or new, new, new machines? This person says the process starts with a laptop request. Basically your manager performs checks sequentially. And then it's approved or not approved. And so you can see after you say in natural language, we can create a process visualization of that. There's a flow, right? Person asks a question, I check to see if they're eligible, and I check if you have a budget, and then I check to see if it's sustainable, and you're done. And so basically, in natural language, this person was able to, John here in this example was able to give you the process and way to Order a laptop from your company. So that's the first step. After you do interviews, here, we did two interviews with John and another person named Max, we can evaluate to see how the process works. So we interview multiple people and there's a slight difference, and that's when you'll see that in the sustainability, Max didn't comment about it, right? So we can actually quickly go talk to Max and say, what's your sustainability policy? Is it the same as John's? If it is, then we're done there. After that you go to the tool mapping case, basically saying, OK, now you have a flow, but how do you know if someone's eligible? So this eligibility check has a question. I don't know what tool to use. Well, every company has their own database, right? And so here you say, OK, open this eligibility check and pick up the, pick the right tool necessary. So here you have a tool called asset master Data verifier. And with that tool, it can check within the company if if you're eligible to buy a laptop, whether it be a 3-year policy, a 2-year policy, whatever your company does. So now you have this tool that says, OK, now this, this tool processes access to this product. This is where you go to, to determine eligibility. And then when you finish this process, you go to the next step of basically looking at these agents and saying this is now available for you to use. So through interviews, through cleaning up, making sure all the policies fit, you can actually add this other agent, and it's added to this list of other agents that exist. So again, this is another case of another way to build agents. You have agents out of the box, you have agents you can build yourself with your studio, and you can also interview and talk to people, personas and get agents built automatically this way as well. So many different ways to do it. And so in this example what I just showed you is basically this interview process, it leads to understanding of the process, and then you need to actually help map the tools, of course, sometimes the systems don't know which tools you use. But once you have all that together, your customized agent is done. So this is just another way to do it. OK. So then, as I mentioned, these are ways you can build with the SAP ecosystem, but sometimes you may want to use other systems. You know, we know that people use other agents, other, other systems, and we don't want to force you to use SAP. We wanna make sure you're as productive as possible, working together with our partner companies. And so this whole idea of multi-agent collaborations has evolved over time. I think many of you know what MCP is. Have you heard MCP? Raise your hand if you've heard of it. Some of you heard of it. Most of you have heard of it. It's basically a way to standardize a protocol of access, right? You can wrap an MCP server around some of your APIs, you get access, people can access it quickly. The next thing was a task handover, right? Agents, instead of agents providing actions, they can be tools as well, meaning that if I'm asked, let's say earlier in the customer service example, if I'm asked to book a flight for my customers, the CRM tool doesn't do that. So your tool says, I actually know another tool, Concur, that actually can do it for you. So these agents can actually hand over tasks. And then finally, the last point is the collaboration where you actually, you have a CRM agent talking to a Um, a travel agent and they can go back and forth and you say, hey, look, I, I need to get to New York, Chicago, and LA, and the, and the travel agent says, here are the flights, and this person comes out and says, oh, you know, I actually checked this, this customer is not available that day. This customer's traveling, and so it can be a back and forth. It's not just a one shot process, it's an iterative process where you negotiate agent to agent the same way humans would as well. You can imagine the way I tell people is like. 10 years ago, as you can imagine, your CRM, your, your sales specialist talking to your one of your travel agents. But the interaction in the email chain, which could be 4 or 5 different turns, can be done all automatically now. And that's kind of the amazing power of these technologies, right? Basically, instead of being a single shot of book me a flight to LAX, comes back and says, hey, I can't do that. There's no flights there. Usually conversation's over, right? But in, in real life with humans, you say, oh, OK, I can't go to LAX. I can go to Burbank or somewhere else in LA. And so basically this whole iterative process happens with agent to agent communications. And so how does this work practically speaking, interoperability. We have inbound agents and outbound agents, meaning that people can use as our agents from the outside, and we can actually have bring in agents the other way as well. So in this diagram, you can look at the full circle. Let's look at the bottom portion first. Basically, if you have an agent you build for yourself and your company, and you want to put into JOL, we talked a little bit about how you do it, right? You have created ADA server and the JUL skill picks it up. And so in JUL says, OK, I know you have extra skill capability, we can now access it. I mentioned. Or org chart agent or something, you can create something like that yourself, we can access it inbound to us using the AAA protocol. On the other hand, we're in the process of building an agent gateway, which lets us enumerate all the agents we have. So if you're, say, uh, you have an agent orchestrating, you're orchestrating a process and you want to actually access, let's say, our concur travel agent, you can actually make a call and say, hey, I need to travel, book a flight. Can I get Concur to respond? In that case, our agent gateway just gives you information right away because you know what agent you want. If it's more complicated saying, hey, I actually have a more difficult question of supply chain, but I know that SAP can solve it, it would then call Jewel and Jew would help orchestrate the process. So there's two ways to access our agents inbound. One is, if you know exactly what you want, then you can use the agent gateway and just call it what you want. But if you don't know what you want, Jewel can help orchestrate the process, and that's kind of how interoperability works. And, and the value behind this is that There's just a whole lot more opportunity where you can actually access agents throughout the entire ecosystem of many, many companies. And we're, we're actually working on, I'm, I'm not, we're not only people who are supporting us, but a lot of people are supporting this 8AA protocol. And so it makes it a lot easier for any customers to, to get things done. And so, you know, in terms of like extending code-based frameworks, I would mention that, you know, since we're here at reinvent, we're working with AWS in several things. One example, one thing we're working on is using strands SDK connecting with light LLM. Light LLM is particularly good at using, connecting with many different code-based agents frameworks and one of them is strands. So you can sort of see on the chemo runtime on the left-hand light, light blue box, you have your strands agent, which I've highlighted in red. And so strand agents works with the light LLM. And then it connects to the right hand side with this purple box that circles this generative hub, which is where we actually have our 40+ large language models you can access. Amongst the 40 large language models, we have some proxy outside the bottom right, you sort of see the Amazon bedrock. We actually proxy and access Amazon Nova models as well as the anthropic cloud models and others Titan as well. And so we actually have the ability to actually connect to 40 plus LLMs, including all the ones that AWS supports. And so this is kind of an example of how you can actually integrate. Different code-based frameworks. This one's AWS strands. Now I wanna show you how to use Agent Core, which is AWS's agent framework, and Joel together and A to A. This is a real demo that was created, and the idea is basically we're looking at how we look at different um disaster relief scenarios. And this scenarios, there's an area, the areas have been affected by floods, and there's an Asian core agent that understands information on floods, and we wanna figure out how to help with the relief effort. OK? So the question is like, what regions have been affected by floods? And so it quickly, you can sort of see here in in geo analysis, geo orchestration, it says there's an Amazon Asian core agent that can do this. So by agent, by A to A, we call Amazon Asian core agent and ask about the flooded regions. And it gives you Miami and a bunch of other regions, OK? And so the idea behind this is that we could pick any of these, but let's suppose we wanna focus on Miami, so we can say, OK, Miami is the one that's most affected, so let's spend a little bit of time looking more there so we can ask more questions about it, so we can ask Agent Core again, hey, tell me about what help do they need, what supplies do they need? And so then it comes back and says, you know, some of the things they need, and it gives you a whole list in a second, but one thing they need is water, and we're gonna focus on, on water. Uh, this is, it's running in real time, so I mean in, in this demo, so it'll take a second or two. So you see here, it gives you different issues of like life jackets, water, clean, drink water, mobile command centers. But we'll focus on water. But before we focus on the water, I wanna say if you're not sure we're actually using this, we can actually go underneath the hood and take a look at what's happening. And this is what I'll show you next, that if you look, you can sort of see the agent core agents are activated. This is looking at cloud watch. If you use that for AWS, you can sort of see the calls are being made, 4 calls that have been made there. So calls have been made. So we're actually indeed working with Choul. And Agent Corps. And now let's look at clean drinking water, OK? Let's figure out how to, how to handle clean drinking water. So so far, Juul's been using Agent Corp. Now we're gonna use S4 with an SAP to actually look at provider suppliers. Look at S4 and determine which of my approved suppliers can support Miami at this point in time. We get two responses back saying these are two possible suppliers. The first one has been approved for specific reasons. Second one's good too as well. And I can say, look, I've given them the supplier ID, we'll just make an order for Oriental Labs Inc. And so I said, OK, place a purchase order. And then the order is made. And again, this is all a real demo meaning that we actually did connect with Agent Core and to show you that we did that, we can actually go into our purchase order um product UX and see you do a search for that purchase order, you'll see it's it's there. You see it there? And so, uh, the, the main goal is that showing you that you can actually have different agents collaborate with each other, right? And so this is just a quick demo to show you how it works. OK, so we talked about agents, and I think that managing agents can be easy, it can be hard. People might say, well, how can, how does this work? Some these demos are obviously easy because there are a few agents in the, in the universe. So managing a single agents easy, right? Let's say I have a sourcing agent, it's like one monkey in the zoo, right? But then all of a sudden you have other agents. You have other agents, it gets a little more crazy, right? Like, it's the same idea if I say, hey, book a flight, right, and I have a concur agent, nothing else, right? But if I actually have a bunch of different travel agencies, then you need to figure out, book an agent using my company's preferred agency, Concur or whatever, right? So basically you need to do a little bit more. But in, in general, how do you handle this? Well, we actually have a process to handle these, uh, wild agents by having a zoo of sorts. And basically this AI agent zoo we call, is basically the idea that we organize through uh LenaX agent hub, different agents in the different groups, finance, human resources, supply chain, customer experiences. And so by doing so, we can actually help provide better context and segmentation to make it easier for you to access your agents. And so by using this tool, as I mentioned, agent hub, you can access all the agents in one place, but not just SAP agents. It also can access third party agents and custom agents as well. So you build your own agent, custom agents are there. You have a third party agent we talked about an agent cop or anyone else, we can also have it there as well. So all of that is, is available there. OK, so we're trying to make it as easy as possible, you know, I, the reason I'm talking about how making it easy is you can sort of imagine in the initial case of a few pages, it's kinda like when the internet started, right? A couple of URLs came out. I don't know if you remember, you probably memorized them. Maybe you go to ESPN.com for sports or whatever. There's 3 or 4 sites, you just memorize the URL, but after it became 1000 URLs, you went with the search engines, right? And this is the same thing with agents. Initially you might use like 3 or 4 of your favorite agents. Over time you might use hundreds of agents, so you need to use something like LiniXHub to track the agents you're using. So quickly to summarize the work on the basically our vision of agents. It's 3 parts again, right? The first part again is we wanna empower businesses with these pre-built agents. We have 40 agents that are already out of the box by the end of the year. We want to democratize the development, make it easy for you to develop on top, right? So the idea is that Juel democratizes business applications by letting um users access with natural language. We're also here for developers democratize agent development using Juual Studio. And then finally we actually wanna make, make sure you can use the full gentic eco ecosystem so we support A2A as well, so that you work outside as well. And so you heard, you know, in the morning Matt Garner was talking about democratizing through platform, right? AWS creates a big platform for business applications. SAP, we create the software on top to also make it easy for people to use. One other thing we've done actually use AI assistances. I wanna explain again. We talked about how you have the Lean IX, Lean IX AI agent hub shows you, you know, what type of agents you have, and that's for humans, very valuable. It helps us to see how it's organized. But machines also sometimes need need context as well. You know, if If you say, hey, can approve this, this process, if you ask a question to you, that's very vague, they might not know what you wanna approve, but What it can do is look at the AI systems which we announced at um SAP Connect in October. We can know what persona you're in or what lines of businesses you're working on, and use that as a, as a as a grounding function of where you are. By doing this so we can scope down the work. If you're a finance professional, if you want an approval, it would be something that your CFO might approve. If you're in procurement, it could be a purchase you're approving. For supply chain, you know, whatever's appropriate, these AI systems help you scope down kind of your universe of agents. As I mentioned earlier, You have a zoo of a bunch of animals in a zoo, it's very hard to know, but if you know you're looking for giraffes, you actually can actually get a better answer, you know what you're looking for. So basically this is the same thing here. And so dual agents, as I, as I mentioned, both visually through for humans through LiX or through RI assistances can actually help you. Organize and uh segment the different agents that you have to deal with. And so the one thing you may want to do if you're interested in our agents, we have a QR code here as well as the URL. I think this will also be available offline as well, so you can actually certainly have access to it afterwards. Just wanted to share this before I move to the next section. So, the one thing that we do is SAP and and and AWS have worked together for a long time. We have a partnership for for years. And so one of the things that we decided to do is basically to help accelerate the generated success for customers. Um, we power the software and we scale on AWS and the idea is that we have this, um, Collaborative agreement where customers can actually make a request and have us help you accelerate your onboarding. And so we have, you know, obviously a track record. We have more than 16 years of working together. We have a lot of industry and technical expertise and then we have this global reach and, um, so the idea is that you can reach out and this unique path lets you get started fast and also is is subsidized by us in AWS. How does it work? So basically, you apply to get into the program, you have an idea, and once you have your program, we approve it, you can, I can be accelerated production. So innovation comes through SAP business processes, we can actually, you know, as I mentioned, scale it through AWS, the adoption, you can run your AI through our environment with built-in safeguards. We have obviously enterprise grade compliance through AWS and through SAP capabilities and the security that you've, you've, you've heard about on both sides. And then. The agility increases too. You can actually get a lot more done with this. And so the idea is you can get this done as early as 9 weeks. And so if, if any of you are saying, hey, look, I'd like to do this, but I just don't have the, the resources to do it, I don't have the ability to do it, this is how you can do it, right? So basically, you make a request, and I'll show you in the next, next couple of slides how to do it. But the cultivation process is very structured. You basically, we take the phase first phase of exploration. We look at key business challenges and look at use cases. And so basically you say, hey, I have a big challenge, a big pain point in my job, my company, and this is what it is. Make sure it works. And then we ideate this use case discovery. We say, hey, do workshops with customers together with AWS and SAP. Let's figure out how to solve this problem. And then we can have an architect come in and help architect the right design, and then we can build it. And so this whole process is actually, like, assisted by us in AWS. You can use SAP's generative Ahub, which is our solution of the 40+ large language models I mentioned earlier, use Amazon Bedrock's capabilities, and then also Amazon and Nova's foundation models as well. And then finally, phase 5 is the implementation with all the security monitors and guard rails in place. So basically it's a 5-step process. The 1st 4 steps can pretty much be done in about 9 weeks, as early as 9 weeks if you're working quickly, and you can actually need 4 more weeks to deploy. So this is a very fast process and if you're interested in doing it, as I mentioned, If cost is an issue, it's, it's a funded project and I'll show you how to do them I handle a minute. But in summary, basically you have inside out or outside in, outside and you have SAP AI core, which is our capabilities. Inside the core is a generative AI hub, which has a bunch of language models included in our Amazon Bedrock LOMs. And so you can actually access their foundation models from anthropic as well as Amazon's native ones, which are Titan and Nova. And the foundation models, you can actually also access coherent commanded and re rank. And so this is the technology you're using and the process if you want to do is you have to contact AI program support at CP.com to get started. And as I mentioned, it'll accelerate your journey AI development, adopt advanced capabilities and leverage our investments. And this is actually doable if you're an associate AWS ecosystem, or if you're trying to decide if you want to use AWS and SAP. This incentivizes you to do that and we actually help fund, you know, together with AWS we help, help support this so it's actually a great opportunity if you're on the fence of, you know, whether not to try or not. OK. So I'll just summarize kind of what I talked about and some of the things that we, we, I didn't talk about, but just the full picture of SAP and I'll go left to right, top to bottom. So basically we talked about agent to agent interoperability earlier and MCP server support, right? You can take an MCP server wrap up your APIs, you can get access to it, and then we can actually allow agent to agents to expand and extend use and connectivity to different API services. More dual scopes have been built. We have over 2100 capabilities total, which basically means In natural language you can actually do a lot of things with our systems across all of our lines of businesses. Two weeks ago we announced that our AO AI model, which is our fine-tuned domain specific model, has been made available inside of, will be made available inside of our generative AI hub for direct access. So any of you are not familiar with ABO, so our, um, Advanced business application programming language is our domain-specific language. And so if you use GitHub co-pilot or any of these, um, coding tools, it doesn't really have AOP covered. So basically we fine-tuned over 300 million lines of internal code on Abop and built a fine-tuned model on AOp AI. And so that model was available inside the Eclipse IDE for about 1 year now, but people say, hey, can we have better access to it? And so now we're making it available in in G AI hub so it can be accessed in other development environments as well. So if you have use, if you develop an AO, if you have SAP developers, you obviously can please have them use that. Um, beyond that, we actually are using that tool also for code migration. We are putting a custom code migration agent. So any of you working on a rise migration or or updating your code can also leverage this capability as well. Lastly in the first row, basically is mutual agents. I mentioned we have 40 by the end of the year, but we have more coming as well. Um, and if you have specific agents that we don't have on our roadmap, you can reach out, reach out and tell me. We can actually make sure that we go, you know, customize and make sure you can get what you need. AS system the second row, AS systems on the left-hand side is basically, as I mentioned, the scoping down. The idea that understanding your persona, what persona you are, and what you're working on could help reduce the scope of what agents are, are activated. And so the idea is that over time there'll be more and more agents, and so having the ability to scope down and help us figure out what you need. The middle one middle box is AI agent hub, which I mentioned already with LeanIX where you can actually have all virtual agents are there, custom agents that you build can be there and third-party agents as well. That way you have easy access to all of them. Middle right is what we announced at the beginning of November, which is the first enterprise relational foundation model. So just to make clear, in case you're not familiar with this, basically, people are building language models, and we built the first business tabular model. And so the difference is basically, if I say, hey, it's cloudy outside today, right? I say it's cloudy outside, I'm going to the closet to pick out a blank. The model can either say, let's say jacket. Or umbrella, maybe 60% chance jacket, 30% chance umbrella, 10% chance anything else, galoshes or whatever. But you don't really think about that, right? You just have a language model, complete sentences, but it's all probabilistic, right? But when you're talking about like your business processes, you do think probabilistically, right? Hey, I need to buy enough inventory for Black Friday shopping. How many units of my widgets should I purchase? You know, it's also probabilistic, right? Maybe 80% chance you need more than 100 units, 20% chance you need less than 100 units. And so the foundation model takes tabular data, which is like Excel spreadsheets or comma separated value files for short, and does predictions on them. The same way language is predicted upon with large language models. And we don't may not think of it that way, but it's the same thing. And so we use the same technology. It's it's a transformer-based technology. And the reason why we can do it is because we have, as I mentioned, data from all lines of businesses, as you've heard already. And so we can actually apply this foundation model across many different Prediction problems and the value behind this is basically 5 years ago when the first large language models came out, you stopped building narrow AI models. No one builds sentiment classifiers analyzers anymore, right? You used to actually have to my, my jobs a few years ago I built a sentiment analyzer for a quicker company. You don't actually ever do that anymore, right? You don't build summarizers. People don't need to have. Have a kind of team of data scientists both summarizes. The same thing happens here with predictive analytics. If you use this RPT one or rapid ones, what we call it, you can actually use one horizontal tabular model to solve a lot of different Tabular AI problems. And so we gave it, it's publicly available in the playground, so you should try it out if you haven't seen it. We've given some examples, but you can do a lot of different things, like examples of like extrapolation. Like if you have missing data, I, I gave you an example about transportation management. If let's say you have a table of like packages and, and you have some missing data points, like you ship the package to me in Las Vegas, you know, what's, what's a shipper, and you can actually use a foundation model to say, typically speaking, Packages shipped to Las Vegas at this time of day or this time of week are are delivered by this particular shipper. And so those types of things are available in this, this model. So definitely try that out. We're gonna continue evolving that, but it's basically I tell you it's kind of like a GPTU1 or GPT2 moment in terms of what happens type of the models. And so this is unique to SAP. So please check it out. Bottom row, I'll start from the left is a prompt optimize service. We made it also available, which lets you change prompts when you change different LLMs. This is really valuable and you can also say, hey, Walter, I use bedrock only. So, but it's fine. You can also still use prompt optimization across different bedrock LLMs as well. If I'm using Nova, and I've been using it for weeks, I modify the prompt. And then tomorrow I say, maybe I should try Anthropic cloud. Well, if I take the same prompt and move it over, I'm not doing an apples to apples comparison. I use the analogy that You, you may have kids. I don't know if you have kids, but if you have kids, you, you raise them, you talk to them one particular way. And then, once your kid's a teenager, your teenager brings a friend home to talk to, to, to, to dinner, and then you talk to this person. The same way you talk to your child and they don't respond the same way. And you're like, I don't understand why. It's like, because each person likes to be responded to differently, right? And believe it or not, we don't want to personify language models, but the idea is language models are trained on data by different, uh, mostly similar public data, but it's all customized to each, each model just the same way humans are all different, right? And so if you tell talk to two different LLMs the same way, you won't get the same answer. So we built this prompt optimizer to make sure we optimize the prompt. That way you can actually get apples to apples comparisons if you're trying to switch LLMs. And that's actually valuable because the next step we've, we've already pre-announced is that we're helping, we'll help you also decide on LLMs in the future. That way they'll give you more ROI to say, hey, look, this LLM is, is more expensive than this other LLM and give it with the same return accuracies, right? And so basically, that's kind of where we're leading to this prompt optimization. The bullet bullet in between is basically, um, we have a, uh, engagement with Joel and Microsoft 365 co-pilot is fully integrated because productivity users in M365 and SAP have a high overlap. So with one within one copilot, you can access the other one and vice versa. And the value behind that is that as kind of we talked about the agent to agent is that we don't expect you as users to go to 8 different co-pilots, right? I mean, if you wake up in the morning. Use one consumer co-pilot at home to set your alarm when you're cooking your eggs. You go to work, use another co-pilot for your productivity tools, use tool for your SAP tools, use 444 more co-pilots. It gets old, right? And so we wanna make sure we're doing our best to help make it as easy as possible for everyone. That's why we have this engagement and we also why we support AA as well. And lastly, I think one thing that's also interesting is, you know, there's deep research now. In the past, you ask a question, you got an answer, you're done. Now you can ask more complicated questions, right? Like, hey, I, I, I mentioned an example again. I wanna book a, uh, a trip to see my 45 biggest customers, and I wanna make sure it fits my schedule and their schedules. That's actually a deep research type question. We have this capability in Jewel which goes deeper and says, OK, I need to spend 5 minutes to give you an answer, but I'm gonna give you the itinerary for that process, right? So that example I gave from the beginning. You can actually apply this and ask these questions now because deep research exists. And deep research means that each of these agents can give you what can figure out what it can do, and it also knows what other agents can do. And in this example I'll give you is basically, again, you might say, OK, I, give me, give me, I want to visit my 5 biggest customers. I go to my CX solution, which is our CM solution. It says, Here are your 5 biggest customers. Here's where they're located. And then you say, OK, go to Concur to find the travel, and here's a potential itinerary. But then before you finish that, you actually have to go to Our our engagement with Microsoft where you look at people's calendars. Are people free? Are you free? Maybe you're, you have Thanksgiving vacation, your Christmas vacation. So basically there's 3 different agents if you're at play here, going back and forth, back and forth to figure out, OK, I finally figured it out. First week of December I'm gonna reinvent. Last week of November I'm at Thanksgiving, but the second week of December I'm gonna go to New York first and then Miami. Third week I'm gonna be in LA, San Francisco, and then my Christmas vacation happens. So basically this, these agents have using research to solve a problem that you have can give you the right answer. That kind of summarizes all the different things that we're doing. I know I have a few minutes left so I can take time for questions, and if you have some, uh, I'll repeat your question, your question.
