  The speaker argues that customer expectations have shifted toward immediate, personalized, and empathetic service, warning that cost-focused deflection strategies will drive churn as switching becomes easier. He positions Amazon Connect as a platform natively built for AI that now delivers “agentic AI” able to act on behalf of customers, keep context across every channel, and scale from small teams to enterprises without new cost tradeoffs. Core themes include integrated AI at every touchpoint, full observability of interactions instead of spot checks, and a simple pay-by-the-minute model that encourages broader AI use. He contrasts this with legacy platforms and point solutions that lack deep integration or fail on complex problems, asserting that Connect’s unified architecture enables proactive outreach, real-time guidance for agents, and consistent experiences across voice, chat, and web.
  
  He emphasizes the urgency for brands to engage customers directly as intermediaries like search and chatbots disintermediate relationships, citing data that a third of customers leave after one bad experience. A flight-delay scenario illustrates proactive, context-aware service: detecting disruptions, offering rebooking or earlier flights based on traveler type, and taking action without forcing customers to repeat themselves. He highlights elasticity to handle seasonal spikes and the need for trustworthy AI responses that feel empathetic, continuous, and personal even when engagements span multiple channels or interruptions.
  
  A retail demo shows an AI voice agent verifying a customer, reviewing history, issuing a replacement, checking inventory, and sending push notifications. The conversation transitions to chat mid-flight while preserving context, providing personalized recommendations and even a game to keep the customer engaged during wait time. When handed to a human agent, an AI assistant surfaces a concise summary, size details, stock checks, and suggested replies, illustrating AI as a teammate that automates lookups, grounds answers in backend systems via standardized integrations, and accelerates resolution while leaving control with the human.
  
  The talk details Connect’s low-code agent builder with security profiles, personalization models, guardrails, and journey orchestration that coordinates voice, chat, and notifications with intelligent branching and contact-frequency controls. Data unification through Customer Profiles merges enterprise sources, enriches them with generative AI, and applies predictive insights for next-best actions, churn prevention, and proactive service. Enhanced observability includes transcripts for AI and humans, visibility into AI actions and tool versions, large-scale testing before launch, evaluation forms to hold AI to the same standards as agents, and dashboards covering agentic activity.
  
  Closing, he stresses that Connect’s unified, cloud-native design—not stitched-together point products—lets teams innovate faster and maintain consistent experiences as agentic capabilities grow. AWS promotes customer choice over walled gardens and frames AI and humans as collaborative teammates. He invites customers to explore new launches, leverage observability and orchestration layers, and “light the way” to better customer service where outcomes, not cost avoidance, drive decisions.

Welcome to re:Invent. It's great to have you all here. This is awesome. I, I recognize, I know it was uh hard to get into this uh event. I really appreciate you guys making the effort and, and getting here in time at the beginning of the show. Thank you for coming. I'm gonna dive right in because we have a lot to cover today. Uh, the thing that I think most of you, and maybe I should start by asking a quick question, how many of you are in the customer engagement, customer service field? Most of you, that's, that's kind of what I expected. That's awesome, uh, definitely birds of a feather here. Uh, it's great to have you all. And for the last few years you've probably heard a mantra of, you know, we're fundamentally seeing a shift that people expect better, more personalized customer service and you probably honestly do believe that, but also you've probably seen during that time that it hasn't happened as fast as we wanted to. But that inflection point is happening now, and a couple of things are going to force it to happen in interesting ways. The first one is the customers are actually demanding it. We're seeing now that 32% of customers say they will leave after one bad experience, and we're seeing it happen. I bet you're seeing it happen in your business. Too, certainly in the ones where switching costs are getting easier and easier every day. And the second thing is your customers are getting disintermediated from you by more and more services, whether that be something like a chat GPT or Google or other things. It's harder and harder for your customers to get to you. Now historically that was probably seen as a good thing. You said, hey, deflection rates, oh we can get rid of that, or we can pay to not have our customer reach us. That might have been a good idea when cost was the driver, but if you still think cost is the main driver of your customer service experience, you're probably going to get left behind. Those same companies that are willing to help you deflect people are probably also happy to take your customer list and walk it over to your competitor and hand it to them. And that is definitely not where you wanna be in the next few years as the world fundamentally changes in the way people interact. You're going to be trying to get as much interaction, as much engagement from those customers as possible, and if you're not ready for that change and actually doing the things that make them want to engage with you, you are going to be left behind. So today we're gonna talk a lot about what we're doing to drive the outcomes there to make that a different experience. Now I called this talk the Agentic AI Advancements in customer experience because I knew you guys would all wanna come if it was about agentic AI. But I also think we're gonna talk about a lot more than that. We're gonna talk about customer outcomes during this whole thing, and that's gonna be really important. I'm gonna have some myself up here, Pascual de Mayo. I'm the vice president for Amazon Connect, and I've got some great helpers. I've got James Boswell. He's gonna come up here from Centrica, and I've got Bamba Dauf, who's a tremendous leader in our SA organization, who's gonna show you some of the real world ways people are using Connect. Uh, it's gonna be a great talk. I'm gonna go quickly because we have a lot to cover. 29 announcements, uh, this week for Amazon Connect. 29 new fully separable customer capabilities. In fact, we probably could have even broken down further, but 29 was enough. Uh, they had to be memorizing them the same way you memorize the states. Alabama, Alaska, Agenic AI agent assistants. The, um, I didn't get all 29, so I, I, I can't even tell you all of them, but it's pretty exciting. So getting back to the reason you're here, the, the thing that's fundamentally changing is that people's expectation for instant is getting higher and higher. You go in and use some of these tools now, and the answers you get are immediate. They're not always right still, but they're getting better and better every day, and they certainly are fast and broad and capable, and people's expectations just are different than they were before. They want to be able to access this stuff anytime, anywhere through whatever touch point makes sense for them. They need to be relevant and personal, and that's been something we've talked about a long time and a number of connect customers have started to get there and have even gotten there, but it's still an area where I see broadly in the industry folks aren't building these truly personal experiences, something that recognizes you right away and keeps your your consistent experience across the entire engagement, even if that engagement gets broken up, uh, empathetic and empathetic and trustworthy. I think this is actually as we move towards these immediate solutions being able to have real empathy, not the fake oh that's a great question I'm so glad you asked me empathy and also having the trustworthy aspect of it which if you're not sure you're getting the right answer, do you really feel like you got an answer at all? We've gotta get people past that. And finally, operations at any scale, whether it's a one on one conversation in your in your small business or you're a very large business, maybe of 100,000 agents, you wanna be able to scale across that and times change quickly. You may find yourself with needing a very heavy engagement one day and very light the next day. Certainly this time of year for Amazon, that's the case where we have massive scaling up and then we'll see a scaling down in the new year. Um, that's something we wanna be prepared for, but some of you can't prepare for how do you scale quickly and how do you operate at any scale is incredibly important. Now if you're out there in the customer service um arena and you've said you are for the most part, then you've probably seen something that's pretty concerning which is that the options you have have you trapped between a rock and a hard place, which is legacy platforms that don't really understand and comprehend AI they aren't really built for it and it's really hard to get results and if you do get results they're disjoint from each other across the experience whether that's multiple AI systems or whether that's the fact that you're that you're um. That you're having to have context across the experience and it's disappearing and so you end up still, even though you have a bunch of smart things in theory, in practice they're collectively dumb. That's no way to live, as the old saying used to go. The, the thing I would say is on the other end of that you've got all these AI point solutions that are saying I can fix everything. I'm just gonna throw some magentic A at it and we'll do everything right. And the thing is they will fix your simple problems, but the more complex the problem gets, the worse they become at it and the more risk you engage with. But the promise is everything's instant and perfect. But when you go to implement that, what we're seeing from our customers who have gone and rushed forward into that stuff is they've come back and said, actually, yes, it took care of some of the simple stuff, but I was already pretty good at the simple stuff. The hard part is the hard part, and so how can you help me with that? And that's where we think there's a better way. We really do believe that it's time to reimagine. Our customer experiences in this new AI era and Amazon Connect is here to help you do that. So how do we think about that in Amazon Connect? Well, the first thing we did was we said you need to have AI working at every touch point. This should not be an and or a question. There should be an and answer, which is from the very beginning of every engagement, maybe that's automated. Maybe it's something that's even in a web page that's telling you what you should be doing. Every one of these experiences should be improved by AI's understanding of your customer, and that context and flow should touch every touch point across the way, and you shouldn't be basing these things on a cost trade-off decision that's making you make a subpar outcome for your customers. So the first step to that is to have a solution where everything is fully integrated. We built AI. I built Connect from the ground up to enable AI when we launched it 8 years ago, it's hard to believe, 8 years ago, the, um, I used to have dark hair, the um. But when we launched it 8 years ago, there was, there was this idea that we had native AI and Kinect, and that was kind of revolutionary at the time. That was just basic NLU and people were blown away. The world has changed now every single aspect of Kinect AI touches everything and it's fully integrated from the ground up across every channel, across every touch point. And then what that means is that once you've got that implemented you're now having full visibility across the entire contact or even beyond one contact in the other contacts because we're able to take all the information all the sharing customers give you and we're actually giving you that capability, um, we're giving you that capability. To be able to do that with each contact, so instead of that 1 to 2% you were doing or maybe 5% if you're really daring and are willing to pay a lot of people to analyze something, why not instead of doing spot checking and saying, well, directionally I know what's happening at some point. No, I know what's happening in real time in every single contact. I can make changes. I can change the behavior of the agent. I can help the agent. I can call a supervisor. I can create follow-ups. I don't have to take stickies and count on good intentions to do the right thing. Someone calls in and says, Hey, I want to change my password. 3 seconds later they say it's because I want to cancel my service. Don't just keep changing the password. Yes, that'll get you lower handle time. I don't think that's what we should be going for. Instead, get that customer to understand what their problem is and help them find the value. And even before that happens, get proactive and show them that value weeks or months before they try to change that password. The hardest part of working out is putting on your sneakers. Don't let them put their sneakers on to go cancel your service. Get in front of that and help them get the value of your service ahead of time because you can see that train coming, and that data is, I bet already in your enterprise. You just have to get access to it. In order to make all of this valuable for you. You're gonna have to understand the cost of it. How many people here have cost conscious aspects of their business? Anybody? OK. Contact center has always been a pressure point for cost, and sometimes that's led to subpar outcomes, sometimes led to good outcomes. Faster customer service is usually cheaper and better, and better customer service is what we're striving for, hopefully. So there's a good aspect of that. There's a bad aspect of it where you're making choices where you're not doing the things you wanna do because you think it will cost too much. Well, with Connect, the entirety end to end is charged no matter how much of the AI you use. You get paid the same amount with this fully inclusive. Solution we've offered, so you just pay by the minute and you get all the uh you want, whether that be agent assistance, whether that be, um, con uh speech analytics, whether that be wrap up and follow up, whether that be automation at the beginning of the call, even if you're using agentic AI for that all just one low price, you don't have to worry about it. So stop making decisions based on costs and start making them based on the outcomes you want and the business outcomes you promised to your, your managers and the personal outcomes you promised to your customers. And then finally I'm betting out there how many of you have tried Agentic in your, in, in your business so far. So I see fewer hands, but I still see quite a few of them, uh, you know, I, what I've talked to you, and I won't ask you individually right now, but I'd be happy to chat afterwards. What I found is it's a lot easier said than done to actually get the results you want. I see some of you nodding your head who just had your hands up. And the challenge is that it's amazing how good it gets to 80-90%, but that last 10% is really hard. Well, we want to enable you to go into agentic on a continuum, and we'll talk more about that, but you don't need to run into it the whole way. Now with Connect you can be 100% agentic if you want to, but you don't have to be. You instead can move there at your own leisure, and again there's no cost implications to that. So Just to make it a little more personal, people here have probably experienced a flight delay. It's pretty stressful. You imagine, hopefully none of you on your way here. I hope you had a clean flight here, but, um, clean path here, but those flight delays are a great example that I think is like you can feel the angst already probably inside of yourself right now. I know I can just thinking about it. And when that happens, the first thing you think to yourself is, oh my God, this is a. Emergency and I've gotta try and get a get this fixed and so you might try a bunch of different channels you go on the app, you go into a chat, the chat tries to sell you something you're like, no please stop and then you give up and you finally probably call in and then you try and get your flight situation fixed. It doesn't have to be that way though, right? Imagine in a world where if you make contact it just says, hey, I see your flight is delayed. Why don't I put you on the next one tonight? And what if it knew you were a business traveler and so it says, hey, you know, I can actually predict flight delays and we're pretty good at doing that stuff now. I can even offer and say, hey, would you like to get on an earlier flight to get there earlier so you don't miss that meeting because getting on that next meeting flight may not get you where you need to be in time. And then finally, why not just have it say, hey, I can actually get you on that. I can actually book you a flight already on a different flight, and you can tell me that's not the right thing to do, and therefore you don't even have to stress about it. That's the difference between really understanding your customer and really being proactive versus talking about proactive, and I think that's where we have to get together if we wanna really meet the the commitments we have to what our customers expect. And so those are the kind of things people are doing with Connect now where we get them working through each of these scenarios. All of these things should have the same experience whether I go on chat, whether I go on voice, whether I'm reached out to the outcome should all be connected, whether I talk to a person, whether I'm talking to AI, all of that needs to feel great together. Well, because of the fact that this is all built into Connect from the ground up, a lot of customers have chosen us. Uh, folks here, connect customers. Raise your hand if you're a Connect customer, if you don't mind. First off, thank you very much. It's wonderful to see you. Um, I remember doing this a few years ago when 3 people raised their hand. I was like, Oh, we gotta start. We've gotten a little further now, which is wonderful, as you can see from this, we've got folks all the way from the biggest banks to real teeny folks, um, like slice Pizza. I always say teeny. They're, they're a very meaningful business, but they may not compare to a Delta Airlines or, or a, um. Or an Adobe or an Adidas, but they're a wonderful company. All these folks are getting results here because they're seeing the value of being able to use connect to create consistency and deep interactions with their customers in ways that were very hard to do with the legacy systems they had before, and we've made it a much easier thing for them. Last year I stood up here. Um, if you were here last year, you might have remembered me very excited to talk about people having done 6 billion minutes of AI assisted interactions on Connect in the prior year. That was pretty exciting to us. Well, just 1 year later we're already up to 12 billion minutes. This acceleration is significant, and this is really because we're entering a whole new era. And with our launches this week you'll see we're now entering an era of agentic AI and Connect as well. We had generative AI. We were doing a great job understanding intense and doing tremendous summaries that really made it clear what had happened in the call. What we hadn't done is really nailed the. We hadn't done there is really nailed the aspects of the agentic parts where we wanna give you the ability to have AI take action on behalf of your customer. Of course the generative part was good at understanding, but that that action is really the big differentiator here. And then of course the memory and the context of it. If you guys have used any of these tools, the ones that work really well will sometimes say something to you like, Oh, I've seen this, so you have this behavior in the past. And therefore I'm gonna make these recommendations when you ask me what's a good restaurant, and that feels a lot better than when it just says, you know, Chili's when you wanted to go to someplace fancy or someplace fancy when you just wanted an easy meal, right? It's, it's those are the things that are different about having a solution that really understands the customer beyond what the legacy AI solutions can do really is that actually you can take an action you couldn't take, but now the actions and the outcomes are aligned to that. And so with our new launches here we offer fully agentic AI in connect for self-service and for agent assistance. We'll talk a little more about that in a second. But our approach to agentic AI is a little bit different than what you've probably seen from anybody else. First off, I think we're much more about choice than anyone else in the industry. We believe deeply that you are gonna want to have different choices, and we think that as a tool we're not trying to build wall gardens. We believe if you come to connect, you'll stay there because you love it and trying to trap you there is the opposite of what we want you to do. And, and that's proven true in the way customers adopt Connect. We see very, very few folks leave Connect, but they have the option. Your data is your data. You have that option. People choose to stay because of the fact that we offer so much optionality and so much choice. Maybe that's true. The second thing is AI teammates is where we think the world is going. We don't think that AI is going to just be replacing people all over the place. What we do believe is that AI and people will get a lot better together, and this idea of having a collaboration and AI teammate is incredibly important to how we think about this. And I'll talk more about that in a minute, but it's a game changer if you think about this, um, and I encourage you to see some of the other talks that are here too about the Quick Suite offering we have, but you're gonna see our this approach throughout all of AWS's offerings. Finally, in order to do this, you need to have data you can access. You need to have the knowledge you can access. And so Connect is built from the ground up to get you access to the data silos across your organization. And uh both do that in a way that's scalable and performance so you can do it very, very quickly. The speed at which you get access to that data makes a tremendous difference in what the outcomes you can have a difference between being proactive, being reactive, and having long waits on the line while you try and do something for a customer because you don't even know what you should be doing. Then once you figure it out, it takes a long time to do it. All that needs to be a thing of the past. You need to be able to make these updates instantaneously, and that really comes down to data. So the, the thing I mentioned before, which I, I saw a lot of you kind of perk up when I did it, is this idea that instead of saying, hey, agentic everything, we're saying something very different. We're saying you can be 100% agentic if you want to, and there may be workloads that that makes sense for, and we also believe you can be 100% human if you want to, and there are definitely workloads where that makes sense too. But in the middle we believe there's a continuum that says I probably wanna be some agentic some human. I want AI to carry the context and provide assistance across that entire thing, acting almost like a concierge for every interaction you have with a customer, remembering every part of it and so if you think about. That then you start to think to yourself I probably still wanna have some of those deterministic workflows and AI scenarios as well in there. Maybe if I'm doing payment processing, I'm not sure how much value agentic AI brings writing some code to do a payment processing request every time. Sounds sounds a little scary to me more than anything else. So from my standpoint, I think this path of being able to say you pick what's right for you and what scenario is right for you without worrying about it is a huge win. And the other thing about that is the tools we are building and to connect to allow you to configure using Agenta capabilities also make this much easier to design, so you sort of get this win at every touch point with AI that's that's very different from where you've been historically. Uh, the speed to outcome is really what you want to get there. So diving into this, what this means is you're gonna have a lot more situations where AI is really acting as a teammate. So you think about this, it's a teammate of the customer, it's also a teammate of your workers, your workforce. And we build that by saying the first thing to do is say understand what you want to get out of the situation. Think about what humans are great at. Accentuate that. Use AI to power that. Think about what automation things are much worse when a human's involved. I mean, I certainly don't want to have to, if I'm trying to check my balance, I certainly want, I, I don't want to have to wait for a human being to tell me it, and I'm not sure I want them to know it, right? It's like these are things that are just much better if they're taking care of a password reset. These are not things where a human brings value, whereas if I have a deep. Question about my finances or perhaps there's something going on with some sort of family member. I, I, I wanna have that human conversation and people are amazing at that. Well, they get a lot more amazing at it when the tools help them focus on the customer and get out of the way by giving them just suggestions that help them do the step by step things they need to do versus them having to sit there and all tab. I'm sure you've been on the phone and heard the person all tapping. Sometimes you can hear their brain all tapping, right? It's like it's so hard to use some of those tools, so that's the key thing there. The other thing about this that's really important, I'm gonna keep harping on this, but I'll do it quickly, but I think if you've been in the business and try to do this, the data is so important. Any folks in here struggle with unified data? Yeah, OK, so you guys are aware of it. You guys know it's, it's the fact of the matter is it's been incredibly challenging for folks to get access to data, and we've made that very simple, but it's not just data that is the data in your system about your customer, your shipping, your ordering databases, your claims databases. What it really is is also data about what's happening in everything that's going on in. Interactions with the customers and what's happening as time passes as you try to solve these problems and so we bring all of this and we're bringing unified observability to connect now with being able to see all the interactions you've had with the customer or the person in all those same tools and all the same systems, the same data mechanisms we're also bringing all the observability into the automated experiences where they. Be agentic whether they be deterministic AI so you can really track everything that happens here and this fundamentally changes the way you think about how you measure things going forward and we get out of that model of just trying to measure average handle time and get into a model of trying to understand did we solve the problem and if not, why not, where should I go look and try and figure things out so this observability is incredibly important. Now I've talked a lot about Amazon Connect. I went fast, hopefully not too fast. I know I'm, I have a, I can be, uh, I'm from the East Coast. I can go a little quickly sometimes. Uh, I think the most interesting thing to hear about Connect though is how customers are using it. And so at this point I'd love to bring James up if he doesn't mind to talk a little bit about their experience at Centrica with Amazon Connect. We had some pop some pop-ups. So good morning everybody. I'm John James Boswell from Centrica, and it's really great to be here at Reinvent in Las Vegas. And being a Brit, it's amazing to see some sunshine and some blue sky in December. It's absolutely brilliant, so loving it. I'm here to tell a story about um transformation in Centrica, and not just transformation in our business. about, about, about how we're transforming our customers' lives and how we're re-energizing how we work in Centrica. Centrica is a vertically integrated energy company. Um, we look after power, energy retail, energy trading, and we've been in business for 200 years. So that's a long time. We've been serving customers since 1812. And um we've served those customers on a, on a daily basis and we, we imagine their lives. Sorry. So our mission is to energize a greener, fairer future. And that is to become a net zero business by 2040. That's five years earlier than we had planned. And also help our customers become net zero by 2050. And that's impressive when you think we're an energy company. We literally sell gas, electricity, and energy to our customers, so becoming net neutral for our customers by 2050 is, is an amazing thing. And also all our customers will have renewable supply. Um, by 2030, so for an electricity company you'll have renewable supply by 2030. So now about technology. So if you want to win in technology, you need to be cloud first. And if you wanna, if you want adapt at scale, you need to be a digitally led business. Centrica is now a digitally led business, and it's cloud first. We moved to the cloud in 2017, and I had a full head of hair then. I don't now, but Um, it's been a journey. It's been a long journey, but it's been a massive transformational journey. So how did we do that? Our transformation began with building trust and developing a shared vision of our end goal. We had to make sure we had the business buy-in and also the trust from our um suppliers like AWS to make sure that we had the right end goal and the right vision of where we wanted to go as a business. And please, the result of that transformation. Uh, we are now a digitally led business and we've moved all of our UK contact centers to Amazon Connect. We now have omni-channel agents who are able to deal simultaneously with web and voice agents at the same time. So, what was our journey? Our journey was a, a really interesting one. So yesterday, we had multiple systems. We had many, many different systems, um, lots of legacy systems. So we had um a different system for each business unit. We had a different system for core analytics, we had a different system for outbound dialing. And I think probably a lot of you resonate with this journey. You have multiple, multiple systems, all working in different directions and not being simultaneously connected together. Those Systems were managed by third parties. Those 3 parties weren't really invested in the journey that we're going on. They weren't really on the same journey as us, so they weren't working with us to to help with our customer service solutions. So it's really important that we looked at why that was. And then we have segmented data. I think all those different systems we're using for customer contact. They didn't talk to each other. They're all segmented systems, all completely different. So for us to get data on our customers on with their complaint. What they're complaining about, getting that rich data was really, really challenging. We had people manually listening um to calls to look at quality. Um, we couldn't look at the analytics of those calls, so it was a very fragmented, fragmented picture. So today, I'm pleased to say we've moved to Amazon Connect. Um, we have a single solution, um, that provides all of those things that those 10+ systems did. We had AI in those legacy systems, but it was more machine learning than AI and it really didn't. Provide the services that we wanted it to. So moving to a single solution withinbu AI has rapidly transformed how we do business. We've moved from third party support in-house engineering with clear product owners, and that's made a massive, massive difference to us. The core engineering team in the IT department, and a product leader in the business who's telling us what problems we need to solve, and then the engineering team we're going to solve those problems. And that's made really clear accountability about who's responsible for what and we can get On with the IT and the business can get on with the business. Um, we're using the built-in automation and AI within connect. Um, we're turning it on as quickly as we can. And it's really important having that business link between business and IT so you can turn it on as fast as possible. For example, we turned on uh management evaluations in a couple of weeks. We can now add images live in chat, which we weren't able to do before. Um, and we're really accelerating the adoption of the AI. And some of the, some of the great stuff we've been able to do is Put in auto wrap. So now we have auto wrap in place and that's making a massive difference. So we've reduced our um talk time by 30 seconds in some cases, which, which is absolutely fantastic. Um, and what we've been able to do with that extra 30 seconds is cross sell between some of our brands. So we've used that spare capacity and the removal of that cognitive load from our agents to help cross sell across our business. So it's driving revenue, it's driving growth, um, by using the AI features in the single SAS platform. So where are we going next? Um, we're looking at Agentic, like probably most of you are, and we're experimenting with that. Uh, we recently did a trial with uh Nova Sonic, and we used that and we saw that it could um fulfill 80% of the customer inquiries using voice. To voice. It's not live in production yet, but we've tested it and that, that works fantastically well. And it's definitely somewhere we're going. And also, we really wanna build a fully genic AI contact center along with a fully fullyogenic business, and that's gonna be really, really important for us going forward. So what impact have we seen? Um, we have 10,000 agents, um, using Kinect, probably a bit more, it's probably about 11,000 now. Um, it's one of the biggest Kinect instances in Amir. Um. It just enabling um Gen AI on web chat and a website has doubled the full fulfillment rate literally overnight. Moving from the old machine learning way to to AI has really made a massive difference, and that's improving our customer service. It's keeping our customers happy. We've reduced our HT across multiple journeys significantly, 140 seconds to 87 seconds, just using AI and Kinect, A wrap, etc. Uh, and we've seen a massive increase in our NPS. We've actually seen an 89% increase across some journeys in, um, NPS just by using the features, um, in Connect. We've also, um, have going live today in, in the UK, um, automated escalation of calls. So if an agent is on a call to a customer, um, and, um, Connect identifies that that customer's trying to escalate something and the agent hasn't noticed, that gets flagged automatically to them. Um, and that's a massive benefit, so we don't miss anything and we can make sure the customer service is great. And we're also turning on this this week as well, um, automated vulnerability, um, escalation. So if Connect recognizes somebody is a vulnerable customer, um, they are struggling to pay for their gas, electricity, that is automatically flagged to the agent so they don't miss it, making sure we capture everything. So. Where are we going in the future? Um, so we're utilizing Amazon Connect agents to provide better assistance and reduce the cognitive load from our contact center employees. That's one of the biggest benefits we found as a, as a company. And when you're using lots of different systems, like I said before, the cognitive load on the call center agents is very high, it's very complex, moving between lots of screens, so we're gonna build more agents. More assistance um for our employees and also our customers. Um, we're just about to start to launch customer profiles and cases, um, and integration through to services such as Salesforce, etc. Um, and where possible, we're gonna integrate as many of our third party systems into to connect as possible. So everything is in one single pane of view for the agent. Um, and then we're gonna continue to look at um how we can consolidate any systems we have left behind into Amazon Connect. So we have one single system of record. Um, we've used services outside of Connect in conjunction with the Connect as well. So for example, we've used Bedrock to analyze customer complaints. Um, and we've used that to. To read all the transcriptions from all our calls and explain why somebody would be complaining about something or having an issue. And that's reduced our complaints by 28% just by using Connect and Bedrock. Um, so there's a lot of exciting things to come. I'm sure there'll be some stuff later in this, in, in this talk that um we can utilize to empower our customers and our staff further. So that's our story of Connect. Thank you for listening and I'll hand back over to Pasquale. Thank you so much. I love that. I love the part where he talked about really making a connection with the customer there and thinking about vulnerable customers, things that, you know, a lot of folks when they think about customer service are so focused on some metrics that are hard to measure, even that are basic. These are the types of metrics that are fundamentally changing people's lives and to me the customers who do that with Connect, I, I, I really feel amazing about that outcome. That's why I get up every morning. That's why our team gets up and works so hard to deliver the software we do, uh, so I wanna thank you so much, James, for that story and, and, and telling your, your tale of how you got to where you are with Connect. We're just getting started though. We have so much more we're gonna do together, which is what's even more exciting, so. Uh, talk a little bit about what we're launching this week. The, the first thing I'm gonna talk about is action with AI. We've tried to break this into 4 different blocks to make it a little more digestible. Again, those 29 services, honestly, I, I can't really list all of the 29 of them, so we're 29 new capabilities. Uh, so let's dive right into action. So. Thinking about actions, the first thing and the one that everyone thinks about is first party agents. Do we're now offering that out of the box with Connect speech to speech capabilities so you can have beautiful voices and, and have a terrific experience there. Um, we also offer MCP integration for all of you tech folks out there. You know what that means. For those that don't, that's the best standard. That we found so far for integration to back end services to allow you to use your agentic capabilities on the fly without having to do a bunch of heavyweight coding. Instead you just define what they are and then connect can access them and take action. Of course you still control if we do that or not, but it's, it's a delight to be able to go in and use the most modern technologies to be able to achieve these things quickly and connect. Um, and then evaluations, so we're continue to add more and more evaluation capabilities for human agents, but now we've taken those same capabilities and made them available for your agentic agents. So instead of trying to figure out what success looks like and trying to then cross the line those, instead think about what success looks like for the customer and then bring that back to bear on how you think about your agentic agents and your human agents at the same time, really powerful for being able to then make progress on both sides so each side can be helping each other get better. And then finally, um, we've added Bedrock knowledge base support because folks came and told us, hey, we really need to be able to get our data in there from our knowledge bases quickly. Um, the great thing is also because of this, the nature of the way this works, instead of trying to do a ton of knowledge management, you start to look at where success happens. Happens bringing all these capabilities together and where failures are happening and say this is what I need to fix versus trying to fix your entire knowledge base and manage your entire knowledge base, which really isn't possible. Instead fix the things that matter that's gonna be a much smaller number and much more manageable. So this is very exciting for you to make real progress. So talking a little bit about what we're doing here, one of the things I'm sure some of you are very excited about is also the capabilities for third party agents. Folks have been asking for this, so we've built tools to be able to bring third party agents into connect as well. This is something I don't think anyone else is doing, which is saying how do we orchestrate across our own agents plus other agents in a way that makes it life simple and possible. For you there's a number of ways we do this that we're not gonna dive deep into it today. We could talk for hours on that, but if you wanna find out more, and I'll say this again, come by the booth. We're happy to engage with you and talk about what we're doing there, what we've shipped, what's coming as well. This is an area where again we're not trying to lock you in we wanna give you empower you to make great outcomes for your customers in ways that really matter and the way we do that is by giving you choice. So the next one I wanna talk about a little bit is the elevating your workforce. Elevating your workforce is actually one of the most valuable things you can do. You've probably hired a lot of really good people. A lot of times they're probably frustrated and hamstrung by some of the tools that you've given them, um, you know, if we're being honest about it, uh, that's almost certainly the case. Every day at Amazon we get better too. Uh, you've gotta be continually doing this. This is where the biggest values are. It's not just about it's not just about saving them time though. It's about making them better at their. Jobs giving them the opportunity to use the things that humans are really good at like great human judgment, like empathy, like passion, like being able to connect with your customers and so the first thing is there really is agentic assistance can help them be able to get better information and better outcomes and better um tools to be able to go and change fundamentally what they're doing on a call. So instead of sitting there fiddling with the things that I once had a customer tell me I have 35 applications, if I could just get them in the right order, that would make a big difference. Instead of worrying about that problem, let's just get the answer in front of the agent, let the tool in front of the agent to let them change the configuration, do the things there, and take away the cut and paste errors, they all tabs, the things that are distracting them from connecting. You'll see we actually took, when we were prototyping this, we actually took our agents, they volunteered, and we said, do some of you wanna try this out, and we're gonna put a heart rate monitor on to see how you physically respond to it. And what we actually saw is folks' heart rate went down. Now, do you think an agent performs better when they're less stressed? I'm gonna, I'm gonna bet they do, um, and those are the types of things we see, these real world results when you take this technology and don't try and just make a side of a box exciting for someone to buy it, but instead you really focus on the solutions that change the way it impacts human lives. Um, this next one, persona-based workspaces, it's kind of a mouthful. Um, the thing about that that's great is we're making it so you can maintain all the same security constructs you have today, but then create, um, UIs using no code interfaces to be able to change the configuration of connector, the experience inside of Connect for folks, so you don't have to be a technician. You can then go and do things. I'll an easy example which is very simple, but we'll get it across is if you wanted to have someone be able to turn on a snow day. Excuse me, turn on a snow day with just a click. That's something that now we can expose to folks. Uh, this is a very powerful tool. I could spend an hour and a half on this one alone. Being able to let your business people take control without putting your business at risk is really, really powerful. Folks love this because it's no code, so you can actually create these things and deploy them anywhere, and they can sit inside of your dashboard. They can set us connect. They can sit inside of any kind of interface you want because they're very, very flexible, uh, a super cool feature. Um, sneaky cool and of course our integration with our integration with Salesforce continues to get better and better all the time. We love what we're doing with them, a great partner for folks who, who like Salesforce. So When we get in here around this, what we really think about is this interaction and this orchestration across agents who are both human and AI, and I'm gonna dive into that, um, now. I've, sorry, I've dove into that a little bit now for you, but I've used a lot of words. I think it might be useful for you to see it in person a little bit. So with that, I'm gonna ask Bamba to come up and maybe give you a quick demo of what that looks like, and he can show you more what this means. Thank you. Thank you, PQ. Hi, everyone. I'm Bamba, Product Manager with Amazon Connect. I wanna tell you something you probably do not know about PQ. His passion for K-pop music. That's right, and there's more. He loves buying these K-pop t-shirts from any company retail, and when we would come in here, sitting on a plane, he turned around and said to me, Bamba, you'll love the t-shirt I got for our event. As he pulled his phone to show it to me, his face changed. The man had shipped it to his house, not here at Reinvent. So he needed to call any company retail and figure something out. I could tell you how that call went, but let me just play it for you. Hi PQ, what can I do for you today? I'm calling because I ordered a t-shirt from my favorite K-pop band, and it looks like I had it shipped to my house instead of the hotel. I'm bummed. I need this for an event in Las Vegas. It was my mistake, but I don't know how to fix it. I guess I could take a refund, but I would love it if I could sit at my hotel and reinvent instead. And if we can make this quick, it'd be great because I'm about to lose connection as I'm boarding a plane. Got it. Don't worry. I'll repeat only when necessary because I know you're in a rush. Have you thought about which hotel you want to ship to? Yes, I'm staying at the Venetian. If if you can send that t-shirt to my hotel instead, that would be amazing. Your order has already shipped, but we can send another one to the Venetian at 3355 South Las Vegas Boulevard. You can return the previous t-shirt at your earliest convenience using the return shipping label I'll send you. I'll email it to you so you have it. Now, let me locate a new t-shirt for you. Awesome. It looks like we've run out of the K-pop t-shirt you ordered. I'm happy to help you select something similar that you'd like. Would you like me to do that for you? No, that won't work. I'm about to take off. I don't have time to do that. I'm gonna need to cancel my order. Super sad. I understand you're about to take off. Let me go ahead and send you a push notification so you can continue chatting with us. Just in case, I'll include a few items we recommend based on your preferences. Enjoy your flight PQ and have a great event at Reinvent. I'm here to help if you change your mind. Thank you. That's what happened. So what we heard was an AI agent that was capable of adjusting how they talk, because PQ was in a rush. We heard an AI agent that was capable of taking actions, sending Shipping labels, sending push notifications, checking real-time inventory. And we also heard an AI agent that understood all the long explanations that Pasquali provided. You'll tell me with all the goodness, Pasquale still didn't receive his t-shirt, and you're right, we need to solve that. But before, let me introduce you to Diego, our contact center agent who's going to help Pasquale in a few seconds. Diego joined any Company in retail not long ago, and he's been super happy to have all the tools helping him help difficult customers like Pico. So, Now, let's go back to Picot. The plane took off at this point. Py quickly logged into the Wi Fi. And receives his push notification and clicks on it. And then he lands on this chat window. Notice what we see here. The chat makes it very clear that PQ doesn't need to repeat himself, because all the context is already here. That's memory, as PQ mentioned earlier. So PQ wants his t-shirt. He's going to go along with this conversation. And the system starts looking for Diego to connect him with BQ. Now we all know that wait times can be long. So the system sends the recommendations that were announced so that PQ can start looking at the t-shirt that he might want for this event. And better yet The system pushes an interactive game that PQ can play with while he's waiting. This is an amazing opportunity for you to send um product information and get engagement from your customers as they wait. Now, in the spirit of reinvent, that's the lucky spin. PQ plays along. And wins a 5% discount just as Diego joins the conversation. Now let's go ahead and look at Diego's perspective here. Diego works on his Asian desktop that is powered by Amazon Connect workspaces and branded. For any company retail you can see on the top. On the left, Diego can see all the chat history. And on the right, the Amazon Connect assistant is ready to support Diego. Now in the center, Diego has a lot of information about PQ including his t-shirt size, and that matters. You'll know why later. Diego glances over the case information and look at the nice AI summary that's on the top that makes it clear that PQ has been sent some recommendations. Now when Diego goes into the adaptable screen, he can go ahead and see the exact same recommendations that will push to PQ. Now he's ready to engage with PQ and ask him if he wants one of the items that was sent to him. PQ loves K-pop, so he's going to say, yes, I want this t-shirt. Now, Diego can start. Looking for information for PQ because PQ is wondering whether we have his size. Now look at the magic that happens on the right. Automatically, the Connect assistant detects that a question has been asked and offers to Diego to go find that information for them. And quickly comes back, and Diego can now go back to PQ and confirms that the t-shirt is available in his size. Now, I told you he loves K-pop, so he wants something more. He's asking, what else can I buy? Diego's new, as I told you. He doesn't really know too much about the inventory, but let's not worry, because the connect assistant on the right comes again and offers help. Now look what happens this time. Not only it comes back with information, but there is an interactive button there that's shown. And Diego can just click on it and go in a display that can help him to quickly add an item and better yet, he can copy a well crafted AI message and send it directly to PQ which saves him a tremendous amount of time. Now PQ wants this. He loves the suggestion, and Diego can move along and starts adding it to his cart. Now Diego can finish. The payment, take payment from PQ and concludes the sale. Now, PQ's quite happy because he's able to get not only his t-shirt. And The additional item that he wanted. But now, instead of just saying PQ is happy, why don't we ask PQ how it turned out for him? How did it turn out for your PQ? Well, looking good, I think. Thank you. Thank you. So I hopefully that made it a little clear how all of this works and you got to see it in action a little bit to make it bring it to life a bit. I'm gonna dive back into some more features because we only have so much time here, but, uh, but obviously the parts where you see the realities of it are far more interesting than any kind of featureless less deep dive, but I'd be remiss if I didn't tell you some more of the things we, we are bringing to life here at at Reinvent this year. So I'm gonna talk about data a little bit here quickly, but data for the sake of building relationships and helping you better interact with your customers. So the first thing is that we've done is we have a tool inside of Amazon Connect that's called customer profiles, and it allows you to pull all of the information across your enterprise into one place and get scalable and hyper performing access to it so you can make decisions quickly. We're bringing a lot more power into that so you can do much, much more with it and so this capability. Inside of of Connect is now in preview with AI powered predictive insight so you can actually then see what you think customers are likely to want. That's how you're getting things like suggestions from me that show this cool Kinetric shirt, the um, not a real band. You can go look for it maybe we didn't, we didn't take the effort to actually put up anything in TikTok, but uh maybe we should have the um. But that that ability to say, hey, here's what this person is likely to want to do can go much further than just merchandizing. It can be a lot of things like, hey, this person's likely to churn or hey this person is likely to want to. Um, need help with something else or if you do this thing you're likely to need to do this right afterwards. All these types of things are the things that are gonna change the way your agents think about interacting or even automated experience think about interacting with your customers. Um, we also are now offering more journey capabilities inside of Connect so you can actually step by step engage with customers in effective ways that lead them through the experience. And everything we do here we build in ways that it can help both the agent and the customer. We think of this as really a team trying to support each other. Now, obviously there may be some situations where there are challenges, fraud, and things like that, and we definitely help with that as well. But the point being is in most cases really the people there should be treating each other like they're friends and having that kind of outcome. Well, if you think about Connect as a concierge actually helping both sides solve the problem at hand, that's a huge win. And then a WhatsApp support for social messaging is one that a lot of you have probably asked for huge to have that here. And so Then when I talk about that those tools, one of the key aspects of this is that we offer world class abilities to ingest data to merge it using Gen AI to enrich the data so you have better data about your customer and then use that predictive capabilities on top of that, uh, and so that's just the core capability of Connect, very important. And then inside of there we also are now offering a ton of new observability capabilities. I talked about this a little bit before, but it's very hard to get great results with, with Gen AI and with and with um automated experiences and with agentic AI if you can't observe and see what's happening. And so we're bringing these things directly into connect. This also means you're not beholden to, to, um, professional services and often bespoke proprietary professional services. Which is pretty awful, brings you back to the, the 90s. I feel like in the, in the model where people are headed right now, sometimes we want to empower now, of course, we're happy to help you with this and we have professional services to help you, but we're in that teach a person the fish mode, not that here's a fish, good luck mode. And so I think it's really important that that's the solution, the way we offer the solution, so you are empowered to not just get some near term benefit and then get left behind. Instead, how do we make continuous improvements all the time. And then The, um, during all of this, all of this is using the same analytics engines and capabilities that are built into connect today so you can see compliance, sentiment analysis, all these capabilities at once all the way across the entire customer journey. So it's not three different experiences for the customer, it's really just one interaction, one in or no matter how many things get fixed or get how many times they get helped in a communication, it's all just one thing to that customer. It needs to be all that one thing to your view of that customer as well. So I'm gonna get Bamba up here. The last demo went so well. I wanted to come up and give one more. So if you don't mind Bamba, will you come up and, and do another demo for us? Thank you. All right, so how did we make all of that goodness happen earlier? How did PQ go smoothly from voice to chat, PQ getting personalized recommendations, And PQ being able to talk to Diego, who got enabled by an AI agent while working with them. How did any company retail, put all of this together using Amazon Connect? It all starts with our Low code AI agent builder. It becomes really easy for people to create AI agents. Like the recommendation AI agent that you, you saw earlier, providing information regarding a t-shirt replacement for PQ. Now when you build these things, it starts with security. It's important, right? So with security profiles, you can define exactly the type of access that you want your AI agent to have. Just like you would do for your human agents. Then we talk about capabilities. You assign capabilities to your AI agent. For example, finding an item that you can recommend that's personalized to your customer. Right. So thanks to 3 new AI. Personalization models that we created. Now it becomes very easy for people to do personalization. And these rely on customer history data, personal preferences, or uh propensity scores when you load your data into Amazon Connect. We use industry standards like MCP integration that allow a seamless integration with your back end. That's why we're able to do sending a shipping label. We're able to send push notifications and such. Now, PQ's explanations were real complex. And yet, the system understood it, thanks to the 4 AI prompts that any company in retail defined that allow it to understand what PQ was talking about, categorize the requests, and being able to provide accurate answers. And obviously when you're doing AI you want guardrails, and those guardrails really helps you make sure that your AI agent is grounded in the rules that you've set for your company, just like you do for human agents. Now, all of this put together provide the experience that you heard earlier. Now, let's talk about journeys. When PQ talked to the AI agent, the voice AI agents, then a push notification got sent and it smoothly went into a chat. That was journeys in action. With journeys, you can combine all of your different interactions regardless of the channels and make them totally make sense as the customer contact your uh company. Now, the journey designer. Leverages all of the different channels and use intelligence branching to make sure that you can contact the person at the right time through the right channel. Now Journey Guardrails help you make sure that you do not overcommunicate to your customers. Because a lot of times, you receive a message while you're sleeping or you're traveling. You really don't want to get anything, you get all of those notifications. This helps you take into account things like time zones, vacation schedules, and all of that, and make sure that you reach people when they need to be rich. This really allows you. To have connected experiences that are all lined up and that works well with what your customers are expecting. Now, we've seen AI agents helping your customer. We've seen it helping also Diego as he was helping um Peak you earlier. But we don't stop there. We also make sure that we provide tools that are very capable for contact center leaders and managers. When you're running this type of system, You really want to be able to test them end to end as you launch new AI systems. Now you can run thousands of tests to make sure that you go through all of your interactions and detect issues before your customers are even exposed to it. And it doesn't stop there. Leaders also have access to metrics, as well as evaluations to make sure that your AI agent is operating properly. You've seen evaluation forms before for all of these agents. Now, with the new AI evaluation forms, you can hold your AI agents at the same level of standards that you hold your human agents. Now we talked about transcript. You already had transcripts for human agents. Now you also have transcripts for AI agents, but it goes further. It also shows you exactly what the AI agency is doing. What you see on the screen is not only do you see the content of the conversation, but you see also the actions that were taken. That the AI agent has taken and the different capabilities that it leveraged to make that happen. In this case, he was looking at inventory. So all of this gets combined with all of the dashboards that we're creating and launching this time, and they are tied to making sure that you have a view of all of your AI agents' activities. It's not just looking at one interactions. It really allows you to make sure that you know which AI agent is working, which version of the AI agent is working. Being able to see all of the details that are related to all of the, even the version of the capabilities that you're launching, and the version of the tools. This allowed managers. And leaders to make sure that they can leverage all of the data that's available there. And this is what we call The power of data that you combine that makes relationships and outcomes as you expected. And with that, I'll hand it over to PQ. So hopefully again that helped make it real when you think about how Amazon Connect really is built from the ground up to treat agents and agents as if they're all agents. The um, the fact that human interactions and bot to human interactions or agentic AI to human interactions are all the same means that the data you get from it. Something you can understand and use together to again improve the performance of both and really create that experience across the end to end customer experience and that is so important and I do love to talk a little bit about why that is because it's something we invested in starting many years ago in Connecticut which is to think about a unified solution. It wasn't built from pieces, parts that were cobbled together. We didn't go buy a bunch of companies and stick them together. Instead, we, we took a little longer path where we built everything from the ground up to use the same engine across whether it be the contact management, whether that be routing, whether that be the automation capabilities. So if you automate a task that has no customer interaction, a chat which. Might have some level of customer interaction with or agent interaction or a full voice experience. Those are the same engine, literally one block that we added to it actually made that a visual experience so you can build those step by step experiences, the guides that guide your agents. Then those guides can also be taken and given directly to your end customers. This is because it really truly is a unified solution from the ground up. And so now that we've done that and we have this foundation, you can see how much faster we're able to move now to deliver this innovation across the entire experience. And so while it's a little bit in the weeds to talk about it, I think it's important to understand that's why there's a big significant difference from what we're doing in the way we're investing than anyone else I see in the industry or anyone else is delivering, and it makes a big difference to you because when you come in in the morning, you really don't care what the technology is underlying it all as long as it works, then you're probably at least pretty happy. Happy, but the difference between you being able to go innovate at the pace you want to, to go build those experiences for your customers and for your agents and to link them together in ways that make them seamless, well, that comes from this investment, and that's why I like to show the slide that shows how we think about observability and analytics as a core part of the entire solution, how we think about the communication channels as something that you interact with, as something that's part of the entire solution, how we think of knowledge and data being plugged into the entire solution. And that's why the orchestration across the whole thing can then be seamless and the data that you get to look at, then you can understand it. And so as we continue to move forward, we'll bring more and more capabilities and with how we'll use agentic AI to actually configure your contact center and view the data but be a beta of that is out now, um, more of that will be coming soon and so you'll be able to see incredible. Incredible outcomes in your contact centers without having to be spending all of your time trying to merge all this data, trying to merge all these capabilities, understand how they work together instead it just works that way out of the box and so again it's about your speed, your performance, your outcomes that really matter that's why we're doing this and and that's why we're so excited about it. So as I think about the future of customer experience, I, I get incredibly excited. I hope you are too you probably, probably when you joined this industry you were incredibly passionate about helping people hopefully you still feel that way because I think we're at the precipice right now being able to collectively together as a partnership between you and hopefully between you and us that we can go do that together to fundamentally change that. Experience and you know as a customer of many of my customers I appreciate every time I have a great customer experience with them. I wanna go make this a different world for people I think you guys probably do too and so with that I, I really hope you join us. I'll say there are some places if you are here to grab some more pieces here to take a look at um I know a lot of people like to take a photo of this hopefully um. Hopefully some of these are still available. I think a lot of the sessions have, have already filled up, but they will become available afterwards. Of course, also come down to the booth and say hello. We'd love to walk you through this. Um, your account manager is also happy to introduce you. Our experts are available to talk about this so you can really deeply understand what everything we talked about today means. Um, with that, I wanna thank you so much for coming to reinvent and thank you so much for coming and listening to us today. So, uh, let's go light the way to great customer service. You may have to pull out a little tab on the bottom. It's about the same difficulty setting up cust uh connect Amazon Connect. So, uh, pop that tab and let's head over and if I see you at the clubs I'll know who you are. Cool, thank you so much.
