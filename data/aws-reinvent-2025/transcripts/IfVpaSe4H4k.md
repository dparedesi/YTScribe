Hi, everyone. My name is Yang Zhu Ji, and I'm so grateful that you still decide to come here after a long raven day. And um I'm a senior product manager from AWS DRS. Today, I'm thrilled to be talk to you something every organization care deeply. About, but often underestimate until it's too late. Disaster recovery. And I will show you how AWS makes disaster recovery simple, cost effective, resilient, and with AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery Service, or we call it AWSDRS. This is today's agenda. Uh, I will start with some, uh, talk about the importance of DR with the real-life examples, uh, how to choose the right DR solution based on your use case, and how does AWSDRS work. Uh, more important, uh, we will go beyond the basics, talk about advanced features, um, and share you more. Uh, let's look at the some compiling business cases for resilience, starting with the real cost of the downtime, and then we discuss why acting now makes more sense than ever before. Let's start with a concrete example. Um, a, um, A global community company and they lost 8.2 million in revenue due to an outage. To be noted, this is not, it's just, it's pure like the revenue loss, not even counting the reputational damage and the customer trust, and um this is not a single instance, a leading US airline lost 150 million in profit. Due to an outage. And these are two examples, but we have more data showing that, for example, IDC report Fortune among the Fortune 1000 company, the application downtime cost can be 500K to 1 million per year. And 76% of the company had an outage in the past two years. So 76%, that's more than half. Um, so that's the problem. Now let's look at why acting now makes business sense. We have the customer, they already realized having the resilience strategy is so important, and they already implement in their system. Um, for this customer, they already observed 12 to 20% increase in the profit margin. So, Making the DR solution isn't about just about the wider loss, but also it gain the competitive advantage for you, because it's uh protects your bottom line. And the question is, isn't whether you should have the disaster recovery, it's whether you can afford not to. So before we dive into the DR solution, we need to establish two critical metrics that help you to make a decision what they are strategy you need, um RPO and RTO. The RPO. Uh, or we call it a recovery point objective. It answers the question, how much data can you afford to lose? Can you lose the data in the past 1 hour? Can you lose the data in the past day? So it's measured in time. And then RTO or we call it a recovery time objective, it asks how quickly you want your service or your application back to the um work. And uh what's the impact of every minute. or every hour to your business. And then we also use the number we saw earlier, let's say 500K to 1 million loss in downtime in for those 101 companies. So It means every minute counts. Now, we know what is RPO and RTO we can use that matrix to choose what strategy you want to use. We will start with the fundamental of resilience strategy backup. This means that you make the copy of your data, and you can restore it in case any loss or corruption happens. Uh, for backup, the RPO can be ours, and the RTO also ours, and it's the most cost-effective approach from these three strategies. Um, and the middle layer will be the, what we'll focus today, the disaster recovery. Uh, disaster recovery is about return to the operations, not just to restore your data. And you can set up a specific targets when the highly impacted application, uh, like there's a failure happen. And the metrics improved significantly, because the RPO is reduced to seconds, RTO can be minutes, and the cost is moderate investment for you. Finally, we have the high availability. Uh, this is the premium tier, and it provides the resistance to the common failures through the design and the operational mechanisms. And uh the RPO is near real-time and RTO also near real-time. And this is the like the uh significant investment that for your most critical application, if you want to protect, then you go to the high availability. OK. After knowing the strategies, let's look at what disaster recovery solution AWS offer. Uh, AWSDRS is an agent-based, uh, replication service. So when we say agent-based, it enabled the high performance capability, because uh it can distinguish the snapshot based the model, and can continuously replicate your data and give you the data protection. Uh, that's why it can reduce the RPO to seconds, um. And uh you can uh the way how you get started with um AWS DRS you can install a lightweight AWS replication server on your source server. So your source server can be the easy to instance on AWS. It can be uh on-premises servers, uh VMware, Hyper-V or even the other cloud-hosted instance. And then once this agent is installed, it will run in the background, and continuously replicate the block level data of your source server to a lightweight staging area within AWS. You can specify this, what region you want it to replicate the data to. Um, so, it, uh, this way, when a disaster strikes, your data on AWS is only seconds behind your uh primary site. OK, so you finish the setup, and the AWSDRS allowed you to do, run some drill or testing to see if this uh like DR is actually working, right? You don't want to wait until the disaster happens and then testify working. So you can easy test on AWS. And when the event of disaster happen, let's say you have an outage, or you have the cyberattack, hardware failure, and you can quickly launch a recovery instance in AWS. So this recovery process, we call it a failover. Um, it's been a fully provisioned EC2 instance, which maps from your source server on AWS, and also it's linked to your replicated data. And your server apps or database running on your primary site, now can link to AWS and it can uh be ready to serve your traffic. Uh, when your disaster is solved on your primary site, that's the time like you want to come back to that site from AWS. We call that process failback. Um, you can fill back your, to your primary site where you are, uh, anytime you are ready, just don't forget to terminate the instance from AWS to save your cost for like to like avoid the future like expense. There are many benefits to use the AWS DRS service, besides the RPO and RTO uh we talked about, it also has lower cost because the replication isn't one on one, we use a very low-cost staging area in AWS to replicate your data continuously. And there's no third party licensing fee or other fees, we manage all this process for you. And it avoids the menu setup. So it's highly automated, because when we do the conversion of your price. Memory site server to AWS. We also copy your configuration from your server. For example, it's converted disk, it launched the correct instant type, also it's create your recovery network. Uh, what's more, uh, so it's support the PIT snapshot point in time, that means you can feel over to the most recent data set, or you can choose what is the time point you want to recover to. So in a case of the ransomware, the other points in your snapshot can be used to as your recovery points. Um, it's very easy to test. You can run a drill with one click on uh DRS console. Uh, it also support a network setting. If your source server is in AWS, you can easily copy your source network infrastructure, and you can include your security group or capture any port or route changes. Uh, data, uh, banking means like by configuring the uh DRS with the uh service uh control policy, there is a specific account you can use and to make sure that uh when there's some certificated um attack happened, you or someone trying to actively trying to delete your data, you can have a very clean environment and making sure the data is isolated from this attack. Um, now, we can look at some details from the architecture wise, how the DR work, and how you can apply this to your application. So, uh, for there are 4DR patterns. So all these 4DR patterns, it has the same destination, which is the AWS cloud. Uh, for the source server, it can be your on-premises servers. It can be uh the from the other clouds, or if you're already on a best, you can still set up a DR, you can do the DR from one region to another, from one availability zone to another availability zone. Um So, uh we will dive into details for uh if you want to recovery from on-premises or from other cloud to AWS. This is the architecture. From the left side, you can see that you have some uh servers from your own premises. And then you can install this AWS replication agent to each of these servers. And once you install this server, it will automatically and continuously running and replicate your data to a lightweight staging error on AWS. Um, one replication server can serve up to 15 servers. And we make sure that this replication is on parallel, and it will make sure the high performance of the replication. Um, when there is, uh, uh, like disaster happen, like we said, cyberattack, or, uh, hardware failure, and there will be a recovery, uh, area, like it will be set up, and all your server will be spent up on with the uh mapping uh AWS uh EC2 instance, and there will be the EBS attached to it. So For the uh replication server, it does a few things. One thing is like it uh send up the replication status to AWSDRS so you can easily check the status of the current replication. And for DRS it can automatically create and determinate this replication. So you can have the full control of this process with, with the console, and you can gather health updates and other status in one place. Um, when the recovery, uh, instance is already set up, your, uh, like application running successfully, and you solve your problem from your primary site, you can launch a feedback, and then the agent control protocol will allow you to have this traffic coming back to your primary site. Um, when you have the DR set up on the AWS have uh from region to region, uh, DR, uh, it's very similar workflow, uh, but the data replication, it can leverage the native AWS services, including the S3 cross-region replication uh for. as there is an easy to easy to transfer. So that means the data transfer is more performance, and it can efficiently build this AWS backbone, and it has minimal latency and because the both source server and the target server is on AWS, but the whole workflow is exactly the same, it's just like more performance. Um, so you might be curious at this point, how do we charge for this service if it's fully managed and automatic uh for your DR use case. Uh, we have three tiers of charging. So for the service itself, we have a flight rate charging for $20 per month per server. And uh for the staging error which is continuous uh replicate your source server to AWS uh we have the uh charge for the minimum of EC2 and EBS usage based on what's your data volume and what's the ECT incident will be used. And when there is a drill or disaster happen, uh we have the temporary fill over cost, which is the easy to instance will be like mapping to your source server. And this will be the temporary once you recovered from the disaster, the charge will be terminated. All right, uh, we, now we know uh all the core function and the offering from DRS. I will introduce uh um advanced the feature, and it can be beneficial to you, uh, and simplify your workflow. It's called a post-launch actions. The post-launch action is a framework and it can automatically ask you that your predefined or customized the actions by launching a recovery instances. So um like it can enable some automatic. validation, configuration or testing task that you can define in a script. Um, and, uh, previously, you might need to manually do a lot of work once the instance is launched. But now it can fully managed by this predefined action. And also we offer the Systems Manager integration. So, this feature is leveraged the uh system, uh System Manager documents and you can run the commands and you can automate the scripts to uh on the recovery instance and your administrative. Failure can create some actions, the task like connectivity, checks, permission validation, and also the framework it can reduce the complexity and the human error in the disaster, the whole process. If you want to know more information or step by step how to set up a DRS, there are some blocks, feel free to scan the QR code. Uh, we have the details about how to do the cross region. Disaster recovery, how to do the cross account disaster recovery, and um also, like, from the different source server, like other cloud or on premises, we have all this here. All right. Thank you for attending this session, and uh we'll appreciate if you can fill up this survey uh on your app. Thank you.
