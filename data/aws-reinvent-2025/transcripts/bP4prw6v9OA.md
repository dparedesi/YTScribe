summary: "This session, \"AWS European Sovereign Cloud: Your 20-Minute Essential Guide (GBL101),\" features Armand Schneider, a Digital Sovereignty Specialist at AWS. The talk introduces the upcoming AWS European Sovereign Cloud (ESC), a new independent cloud region physically located in and operated from the European Union, launching by the end of 2025. Schneider explains the drivers behind ESC, including stringent data residency, operational sovereignty, and independence requirements from highly regulated industries and public sector customers. The ESC features a completely separate partition with its own root of trust, identity management (IAM), billing, and DNS, ensuring that not only customer content but also customer-generated metadata remains within the EU. It is operated day-to-day by EU resident employees under an independent governance structure with four new EU-based companies. The session highlights that ESC will launch with over 80 services, aiming to be a full-featured cloud rather than a limited offering, while maintaining the same security and agility as the standard commercial cloud but with strict separation to meet sovereignty needs."

Well, hello, good evening everybody. My name is Armand Schneider. As you can see, I'm a digital sovereignty specialist out of Germany, and our topic today is giving a very quick intro on the European sovereign cloud which is upcoming very soon. The challenge is to do it in 20 minutes, but I'll try my best. All right, um. Before we get directly into the ESC itself, right, I think it's quite important to set some scene on why we did that, what the digital sovereignty landscape is, which kind of requirements we're addressing with this additional offering, um, and then also taking a deeper look on what the European sovereignty cloud is, right? So if you take a look at the landscape, um, I mean we're hearing. A lot of different things and they are slightly different across the world, but if you take them in a common scenario, right, we're talking about data residency, who has access to my data from an operator perspective, resiliency, transparency. And then, you know, fairly also very prominent these days the topic of independence and survivability, right? I mean, what does it take to be independent from whatever independence means, and I can tell you, I mean, in different places of the world you will have different opinions. Some people think the data needs to stay in their countries. Some people are lucky if the data leaves the country and is protected elsewhere. It's a different definition. But if you take those topics and we now group them a little bit in a vertical order here, we're basically putting together the data residency and operator access topic as kind of a data sovereignty. Where is my data? Who can access my data? And then on the right hand side they have the resiliency and independent stuff as operational sovereignty summarizing it as a digital sovereignty as a whole, right? I mean this is a 10,000 ft view on what it is and there's very little nuances all over the place but based on this, I mean about 3 years back exactly at this time. We made the statement of the digital sovereignty pledge, and it's basically really the promise from us to say people or customers should have control over the location of their data. They should have control who is accessing their data. Encryption, a topic you have to encryption on transit, in use, or on the wire. And we also want to provide the highest resiliency of the cloud, so that's basically the promise and a lot of those things have been there before, right? But looking into that a little bit from a timeline perspective and we don't have to read all of that, right? So if you start from that from that angle here and you see 2022 there we made basically the statement of the digital sovereignty pledge and during that time you can see quite a lot of things happened and they could be either. I mean announcing a new operational component, technology enhancement, but also technology in relation to contracts, and if I take a look at this one example here. At this angle we had the first attestation of our nitro system, and the nitro system for us in the sovereignty space is one of the core functionality because it gives us this zero operator access capability as a design of the cloud at all, not just the European sovereignty cloud, but while we had nitro started in 2018, we only came out with a third party attestation that there is no operator access in, you know, almost 5 years later. And I mean one of the reasons is it's super hard to prove that something does not exist, right? But having that said, we made this assessment here, but at the same time we brought it into the service terms which made it a contractual statement from us. It's not just a paper thing, it's also part of your contract, right? And if you go further down the line, announcement of the European sovereignty cloud. And now end of 2025, you're basically seeing that we're looking quite close to the release of this. Before we dig into the EC itself, let's take a look at a few components because I think it's important. When we look to the left hand side, um, we think and we believe that the AWS cloud is sovereign by design, right? And the ESC we will see that in a minute is an additional offering with additional things you can get from us, right? But in the governance cloud, I mean you have all these things like control of your data, encryption, the zero operator access, all of those things exist today, right? But people in different places and different industries have different requirements. So if we go a little bit to the next in countries very specifically where we don't have a region in the country, right, a lot of requirements coming from laws that certain data needs to stay in the country borders, right? So outpost is an option where you can put your data. In the boundaries of your country or even if you're in your own data centers if you want to, that is one option going into the right which extending the sovereignty of the regular AWS cloud right if you go one step further again I mean then you can have look an AWS output is not enough. I need more. I need more services. I need a much higher scale where basically introduced the concept of dedicated local zones, which is a local zone but dedicated to. A certain customer, typically a group of customers, but let's be honest, that's also quite a big investment in order to get to that. But it gives you the benefit that the resources are only for you and you can even have a certain word on which kind of resources and services we will provide that. So all of these options are here shown up as an addition to the commercial cloud environment. And then the next offering on the right hand side is the AW submarine cloud. So this is yet another option, and we will dig into it a little bit deeper. Very well tied to European Union specific requirements and they are requirements sometimes from highly regulated or public sector customers and we did quite a lot of extra components but if you guys are aware of the components like we do in the GovCloud, I mean you can think about some similarity even though there are differences compared to that. So let's dig a little bit into it. So the European sovereignty cloud is set to launch by the end of the year, so we're we're basically pretty close to it. It will be a physically separated region and the first region will be starting basically in Brandenburg in Germany that is pretty close to Berlin, right? Um, and what we're doing here is really a complete new petition as we call it with quite a lot of additional component, but. What is important to state, and we'll dig deeper into it, that it's not only the customer content state within a region, we're also creating all the customer created metadata states in the European Union. And we do a completely day to day operation with people from local entities which really need to be on the European ground. So it's really also a completely different operational model and we'll dig into it. So how did we come to this? I mean about 3 years back when we announced that we basically looked for requirements across customers, regulatory bodies all over the place on what customers require from us to satisfy certain needs. And while there isn't a common framework available yet across the European Union, I mean we defined what we now call, and I didn't change the slide last minute, the sovereignty reference framework, which is basically we captured all the requirements which are needed to design the European sovereignty cloud. We will make this framework also available quite soon and it will be also part of our audit processes once the region is launched, so we're not just saying these are the requirements, we're also putting controls in place which are telling you with the evidence from an audit that we're taking those controls, but that's really the base of the design, right? We're having an independent governance structure, though I'll talk about a little bit later on how that looks like. And one of the statements we also made is that we've designed this cloud for indefinitive operation, though I think that is a quite a strong statement because it's not saying it can survive a month or 3 months or 6 months. We're stating it is indefinitely operational under whatever circumstances. This requires quite a lot of. To do and that's what we see on the right hand side. So we really established a complete new route of trust, right? So the whole certificates authority is separate. The top level domains are separate. I mean the IM system is separate. So it really basically on a daily operation it has no dependency on anything else in the world, right. There is a replica to the source code available in case we need it, and there's also dedicated security operations center, so everything is basically operated out of its own infrastructure. So how does it look like from a governance perspective? So we founded basically 4 new companies which are operating the ESC um, and if you start on the bottom left. So the infrastructure subsidiary basically owns everything from the physical perspective, so the data center, the location, the networks, the cooling, the power, right? This is what we're doing in other regions as well, but it's an independent company running this. Then we have this part in the middle which is really service teams and people which are operating the European Southern Cloud independently, and this includes 24/7 technical support and technical account manager out of the European Union. And then on the right hand side you can see we're having a different company just using or holding and owning our root of trust authority, right? It's it's not too many people in there. They are really the ownership of the of the PKI infrastructure. On top of this there is then basically the holding company. Which is having managing director as well as an independent advisory board really controlling the stuff underneath and the concept of this model is we're physically separated the European sovereignty cloud from a network perspective though you can't access this if you're not on EU ground, right? I mean I could try. I have access to it. I could try it from here, it's not going to work, right? And basically therefore everything is being controlled by the management of these companies under European law. I mean this is basically there. What we have done on top as well, we have an advisory board with memberships with non-AAWS or Amazon employees who are getting also full transparency. You can see I mean we're quite invested a little bit also on this infrastructure part because it is on the one side side technology, so network separation, independent stacks, but it's also I mean an organizational thing on top of it. I mean who is owning it, who is controlling it, who's making decisions by the way. So if you go one step further. Um After that, the people who are operating the European sovereignty cloud are supposed to be employed and need to be resident in the European Union. And they need to be located in the EU for operational purposes. The ESC will be open for customers all over the world. It is an internet connected cloud, but for us as a cloud operator, we can only operate it while we are in the EU boundaries and while we're basically employed with one of those entities in our EU residence. We also made an announcement that this will change in the future. Toward EU citizenship that has been a change in the requirements, so we're also adopting that, uh, probably not right now. So long story short, I mean it's really full control of the operations on that even so we're still using the same global code because we don't want to lose the agility of the cloud. So we're basically using the code base, but these teams are controlling it, can stop it, can roll back, and so they have the full control of the operation. Um, If you go one step further looking into the data perspective, I mean what you see here on the left hand side, customer content stays in the region you choose. This is true for the commercial cloud today, I mean for 95% of our services, they are regional or zonal services. You select the region we're we're not transferring the data out. However, what is potentially leaving the region by the nature of a global cloud is what we call customer graded metadata. So that could be name spaces, so the name of an S3 bucket is a global name space. So if the name contains any kind of sensitive data for you, which people advise not to put sensitive data in there, but it's potentially being. Able to leave the region because it's metadata in a global partition within the European sovereignty cloud everything stays in the European Union, which means stays in that partition. So think about it. Look, this is actually a new region with a similar thing like US East won in 2006, right? So data difference is really on the right hand side. What you have on the left hand side is true as well. What we are also seeing, and this is something I think on the, no it's not on this slide, it's it's missing here, uh while we are having an own IAM system we're all having our own DNS system also these data like roads and permissions are independent and staying also within the region of the European sovereign loud. Having that said, I mean there's also separate billing for the European sovereign cloud, and people can also choose to bill in euros if they just want to, right, so there will be also a local billing system, so they're also not billing data is leaving the region. All right, so if you go next. If you take a look at this, I, I, I avoided to use a slide where all the services are listed because it's not readable, but if you go to this hyperlink, you will see we will launch a region with roughly about over 80 services, which is more services than in any other new region when we when we launch them, right? And why I'm saying this, the goal here is the ESC was supposed to be a full flavored cloud. We don't want there to be a limited cloud with a handful of services and limited functionality. It's really supposed to be a fully flavored cloud, and if you go to that link, you will see all the services we will launch with. And as in any other region, there is more to come. I mean, we're basically building additional services and we'll also launch a roadmap, but if you look into it, it's a quite strong number of services right away. It's also then because in order to be a full global cloud, I mean also a huge number of already assigned launch partners and there will be also an independent marketplace because they also want to have customers to have the capabilities to use stuff from the marketplace and use all those components which they are used to have in there. Important to say I mean those partners are sometimes operational partners. Those partners are people who are on the SARS providers side, and there is quite a mix of all of them, but there's a huge number of people also having the sovereignty compensency because I think it's important to mention, I mean we have put our sovereignty requirement framework and boundaries for us, right? But if a customer is operating on us, right, I mean and their customers are probably demanding a similar component. Because it doesn't help if you're just deploying your software on the sovereign cloud if your operational concept is not sovereign in what your customers are asking for. So that's where we're also looking into the Competency component we're still not forcing people. I mean whenever a customer is doing something on the European sovereign cloud, it is their responsibility, but it's highly advisable to also look to those competencies because we believe if people make the decision to go to the European sovereign cloud because they have Requirements, they should take it in the full picture. Well, having that said, we also think people need to take a look at the requirements if they need the additional component of the European. This is certainly not a one size fits all, and it's just an additional offering to what we already have in the commercial cloud. And the things like outposts and dedicated local zones. So having that said though, if customers said, look, I mean this first region is in Germany, but I'm in another state of the European Union, I want to have dedicated local zone or outposts connected to it, that's possible as well. It could be an extension of the ESC as it is an extension of the commercial cloud, but the general concept really is to have a full flavored cloud. Uh, and really having all the services and functionality, knowing that you can't make a 1 to 1 comparison on day one, right? Um. Yeah, then I mean last slide, I mean the region is still supposed to launch by the end of 2025. We basically have not yet made an announcement on it but we'll certainly do and then as I said the region will be available in general to everybody. That's also different. It's not tied to a certain group. I mean everybody can sign up for an account in the European sovereignty cloud. They will be able to create their own account. Keeping in mind there is a new IM system, there will be new accounts, there will be also new organizations. The org structure and the government structure needs to be replicated. And if you're operating in both parts of the world, you also need to consider different IMs or your federation might go in both places, but we are not allowing you to do an assumed role between petition by the nature of it, right? Same thing is true, by the way, for things like networking. It's internet connected, but for example if customers want to use Direct Connect, there's direct connect point of presence for the ESE in parallel to Direct Connect because the network is by purposely built separated from each other. All right, I mean this is about on the content. I will probably be around if there are questions, and other than that, thank you very much for your attention.
