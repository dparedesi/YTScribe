Hello everyone. Thank you so much for being here. So it's really nice seeing you guys to talk about an important topic that's like reinventing your career. That's not about my career, but it, I will use my career a little bit to show some examples of how can you reinvent or change your career, and I would like to start with a simple question. Who here uh in the last few years think about like changing to a new role, even inside tech or not, or maybe move? I, I believe it's, it's common, right? Yeah, thank, thank you. Yeah, uh, a recent study shows that at least 95, 95% of people in tech would like to change their role at some point in life, right? And 40% of these people think that they will change at least 3 times, and most motivated nowadays because of the Rapidly evolving with all the AI cloud, and all the, the, the tech that we have. Uh, we've been seeing a lot of, uh, jobs or job roles uh in the past few years, like data scientists, an engineer that's was something new a few years ago, but now we have a lot of emergence, uh. New positions, right, so AI ethics, AI behavior analysts, prompt engineer, context engineer, so all of that, it's kind of new, fancy, and people maybe would like to change. It's completely natural and people will move because technology is moving and they would like to move too, right? So transition in tech is like really common. Uh, people from infrastructure would like to move to development or maybe from data to AI or maybe you are a developer and you'd like to start your own company, right? That's a different move. So even in tech, that's not like really, really easy, and uh, and who I am? I'm Fernando Pena. I'm head of cloud services at my company and I am the AWS community builder for the 50 years now and I'm the leader of the AWS user group in Miami. But of course I, I wasn't born like that, so I'm kind of. My, my career was not start like that. My career started in 2004. When I, I start like just support, technical support and development, and then I go to the SAP world as a developer, as a specialist, and after solutions architect, uh. 2019, I start changing a little bit and I started learning more about Chatbot before all the generative AI when we were still using like the NLP at that time, right? And that's when I, I started learning more about cloud and AAWS specifically. And at that moment I, I was as a speaker for the first time, uh, in a big conference in Brazil, and I start creating more content about SAP and AWS. So at that moment my career was changing a little bit from the SAP and cooperative world for cloud and more uh technology world at this point. And in 2021 was when I joined it, the AWS Community builder programs was basically a game changer in my career at that time. Uh, gave me visibility, networking, and everything that I need when I was arriving to a new position or talking about a new technology at this moment. And at this point my boss just came at me and said, hey, if you believe in clouds, so you should create a division and make it happen, and say, why not? Uh, I can try, right? I. Knew nothing about business at that time, that time, strategy, marketing, whatever, uh, but I got this challenge and I start, uh, this division and that's when I became the head of cloud. So, uh, 2023 I can start everything again. I moved to the United States from Brazil. You need to start from scratch networking, making new friends, and you need new contacts was exactly when I start helping the Miami user Group. And 2025 I became the, the Miami user Group user leader was the beginning of this year and then I'm here being, being a speaker, right? So that was like a huge movement in my career even inside tech and what really helped me was exactly the community, right? So it's, it's not easy moving to a position to another. There's a lot of common questions that maybe you, you, or, or thoughts that, that, that you have. Uh, first off, then is like, am I capable? Because you have maybe 10 years of experience in one. Area you want technology, maybe you don't think you're capable to move, right? That's really common thought. Another one is, do I have to start from scratch again, so I'm a principal developer, I'm a senior developer. Should I have to be an intern again and like start everything again, and I don't think so, but I'll explain better. And what about my paycheck? It's a fair question, right? Maybe you have enough money and you can. Don't, don't think about it, but if you have bills, if you have a family, that's the first thing, that's the first thought, because you need to understand if you can keep what, what you're doing, OK? Or maybe you say, oh, I mean, for me, I'm in my 40s and I'm not, not young enough, right? Well, that's, that's not a question. It's, it's about me, but I, I am young. I'm pretty sure, at least in my mind I'm, I'm young, OK. So again, you have a, you have a great job, but you got stuck in, you would like to move, you'd like to start a new technology, you want to study more, more about AI, uh, but you don't have visibility. You need to change, so you need to move, right? That's what you want to do. And moving is never easy, OK? And if you do the wrong movement, maybe it can be risky. You need to do it just like, like, like the right way, right? So how, what you need to do is like you have your position and you would like to move to your target, that's your new role, but there's a gap and you need to fill this gap. So how can you fill this gap? Maybe you can jump. OK, good luck, but I'm, I'm not sure if it's the best solution, so. You should build a bridge. It takes time, but it, it will take you to your goal, at least safer in a smooth way in your, in your career. And how can you, how can you build this bridge? In my personal opinion, I think you should build a T-shaped career. Uh, maybe most of you already heard about the T-shape, but I'll explain a little bit. T-shaped career, you have your area of expertise, your deep knowledge, but at the same time, you should develop other skills, your technical skills, your soft skills at the same time, because if you want to go for a leadership role or if you want to go to a different uh area of expertise, you kind of construct that when you are working in your area of expertise, right? So for example, you can learn AI NML and you can learn uh leadership, even being a developer, or you'd like to learn more about data, problem solving, s, infrastructure or work in collaboration. Soft skills are awesome for your career. It doesn't matter if you're gonna change or not, but if you like to move for some diff you're a developer and go to data or AI, you should start learning in. When, uh, when, when you still are employed and you still have your job and you can uh take disadvantage, right? So again, how, how do you make this move, build this bridge with your T-shaped career. That was not AI generated images because it's ridiculous, but it's just to exemplify this move, right? This is how you fill the gap that you have between your current position and your next position. And besides that, you need to build authority and establish trust because if you would like to start, if you don't like to start from scratch again, people need to trust you, they need to believe you. That's how you need to. Uh, show you and, and create this trust, uh, for yourself, right? So certifications are a very good point. Certifications are essential, but they are not enough, right? You need, you need to develop a personal brand. You need to talk to people. You need to create a networking. So certifications that, you, you need more, right? Certifications are good, but you need to create visibility for that, right. So you build a personal brand, but what's the key for your success is the community. That's what I would like to talk and exactly what I mentioned with my career when I say that the, the AWS community builders program changed my career was exactly because they can help you with networking, building your, your brand, right? So get involved. Yeah, the user groups are excellent if you would like to make more friends, improve your networking, uh, know more people from the same. Technology that can help you uh view for a job or getting a new job, leading a new company, introduce you to more people, that's excellent, right? The community builders program is a program that you can create content, create visibility, create this kind of authority because people will start trusting you because they see that you are really building and helping others to learn. So that's another great program. Another good thing, and you guys are already doing this exactly here is attending events. Attending events are, are really important to connect people, more important than the talks and all the content that we have here in Swags, making new connections here, uh, it's really awesome. That's one of the best points of this kind of event. So reinforce, reinvent, and even the, the global summits that you have in different kinds of cities, that's really, really important, right? So, uh, I would like just to wrap up everything, but again, A lot of people are moving to different roles, different technologies. That's really, really natural, so don't be afraid, right? You're not alone. That's a really natural thing for doing, especially now with all the technology evolving, right? Again. Build a T-shaped career because it takes time. You need to create trust. You need to create a brand, so you need to move smoothly for a new position. So you, as soon as you start learning new things, you create this visibility, it's best for you. And again, get involved with the community, get involved with community builders. Uh, here at the expo we have a community desk that you can. Get more information about the user groups, the user groups that may exist nearby where, where you guys live, and being part of that's like, like really, really cool, right? So, uh, that's, that's my point for this kind of move and career, and uh of course I would like to connect with you if you guys want. You have all my social medias here, LinkedIn, YouTube. I also, I'm always creating content. Connect with people and if you guys have any question, I, I, I'm here. Thank you so much.
