You ever inherit someone else's innovative tech stack, their legacy code, dead-end contracts? It's called tech day. Also known as  license costs, dependencies, patches. You want to innovate with AI? Not happening. Because if your workflow still requires a spreadsheet and a prayer, it's not a process. It's a hostage situation. You can't build the future while dragging someone else's past behind you. So maybe it's time to do what innovation demands. Maybe it's time to send that back where it came from for good. AWS transform. Crush tech forever. Hello everybody and welcome to reinvent 2025. WE ARE COMING TO YOU LIVE FROM THE LAS VEGAS FESTIVAL GROUNDS and it is an absolutely incredible scene out here today. As you can see, we've added a new stop for these decommissioned servers before they head to the recycling center. We've got an old server behind me, 120 ft in the air. I I don't know what that is in meters. We're taking the idea of crushing tech debt to a whole new level. BUT BEFORE WE CRUSH SOME TECH DEBT, LET'S GO BEHIND the scenes. So, we're here at the Las Vegas Festival Grounds. AWS brought in one of their old main frames. We're going to drop it. We're going to blow it up. It's going to be amazing. We have Las Vegas Fire Department here on hand. We've had a safety briefing. Got a blast shield over there to keep people safe. All right, we're going to drop a server from the sky about 150 ft up. There's nothing going to be left of this thing behind me. We got 10 propane poppers. We got 4 lbs of benzol. It's going to be nice. It's going to be big. It's going to be hot. Everybody is ready to go. We're ready to do this thing. That looks like a fun day at work. All right, folks. It's looking good. Let's get ready TO BLOW UP SOME TECH DEBT. >> Are we ready? >> And broadcast is good to go. >> Operations perimeter all locked up. Ready to go. >> Payload secure. Crane's good to go. effects is hot. Okay, all systems go. WE ARE READY TO COUNTDOWN. HOW ABOUT THIS? LET'S DO IT TOGETHER. RIGHT. 10 9 8 7 [screaming] 6 5 4 3 [screaming] 2 1. WOO! COOL. THIS IS AMAZING. DID YOU ALL SEE THAT? I THINK YOU DID. That wasn't just crushing tech debt. THAT WAS OBLITERATING IT. GOODBYE, SARANORA. Humber AWS partners, customers. You want to modernize legacy workloads?
