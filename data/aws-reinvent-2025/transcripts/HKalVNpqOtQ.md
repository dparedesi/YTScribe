summary: "This session, \"Build resilient and low-latency hybrid telecom infrastructure at scale\" (HMC328), features Jose Flores, Director of IT Operations, and Juan Gura, Cloud Governance and Engineering Manager from Liberty Latin America, detailing their ambitious migration and modernization of Puerto Rico's mobile network following the acquisition of AT&T's operations. The project was driven by critical business pressures: operating under a costly Transitional Service Agreement (TSA) with a fixed end date, needing to migrate over 2 million subscribers from AT&T's legacy IT stack, and the requirement for a modern, scalable architecture to compete with agile rivals. Liberty Latin America, a leading operator across the Caribbean and Latin America with 40 markets and 50,000 km of subsea fiber, faced the dual challenge of lacking a mobile-ready BSS stack (having previously been a fixed-line operator in Puerto Rico) and needing to ensure extreme resiliency in a region frequently battered by hurricanes. The solution centered on a cloud-native architecture anchored by AWS Outposts and Local Zones to achieve the strict 15-millisecond latency requirement for real-time charging (OCS) while ensuring high availability. Flores outlines the architecture: Salesforce manages the product catalog and CRM, Aria handles billing, and Matrix serves as the OCS charging engine. Crucially, the primary Matrix OCS instance runs on an AWS Outpost directly in Puerto Rico to sit next to the mobile core (EPC/5G Core), achieving ~10ms latency. For disaster recovery, a passive OCS instance resides in the AWS Miami Local Zone. Juan Gura then deep-dives into the \"foundation under the sea\"—Liberty's own subsea fiber network (ARCOS and Americas II cables)—which treats the connection to AWS Miami as an extension of their local network, providing the shortest, lowest-jitter path possible. They utilized AWS Direct Connect with dual 100G links for redundancy. The hybrid architecture leverages AWS Transit Gateway as the \"brain\" for routing traffic between the on-premise mobile core, the Outpost in Puerto Rico, the Local Zone in Miami, and the main AWS Region where other SaaS workloads (OSS, mediation) reside. This setup ensures that even if Puerto Rico suffers a catastrophic event like a hurricane, the system can failover to Miami seamlessly. The project not only solved the immediate TSA exit and latency challenges but also established a replicable \"cloud-native telco template\" that Liberty can now deploy across its other markets. Key lessons learned included prioritizing proximity of compute to the network core, choosing agility over heavy customization by adopting SaaS-first principles, and leveraging their own physical network assets to bridge the gap between on-premise constraints and public cloud scalability."

Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Uh, my name is Jose Flores. I'm the, uh, director of IT operations at Liberty, uh, Puerto Rico. Today we are going to talk about how we build resilience and low latency hybrid telemunication, uh, infrastructure at scale. Uh, together with my colleague Juan, we are going to go through, uh, how we build this, uh, infrastructure in Puerto Rico, and we will try to cover some of the main challenges that we, that we face over this, uh, uh, this journey. Um, today we, we, we are going to start, um, talking about, uh, introducing, uh, liberty in Latin America, who we are, where we operate. Uh, to send the foundation of this, uh, uh, presentation. Later we will going to talk about the challenge that we face, uh, after the acquisition of the mobile network in, in, in Puerto Rico. Uh, from the business standpoint, uh, at the infrastructure level, uh, And later, uh, we will go to the main, uh, uh, topic of this presentation which is the solution. Uh, we will going to cover, uh, uh, the uh the infrastructure that we build, how we achieve high, high viability, and high resiliency, uh, in Puerto Rico using AWS Autos, and how we implement their charging solutions, uh, in the Puerto Rico market. And the, the last point, um, we were going to talk about the lesson learned, um, and, and what is next for Puerto Rico. Liberty Liminica is one of the main lead operators in, in Latin America and the Caribbean market. We have presence of more than 20 customers and more than 30 B2B market. Uh, we have an extensive submarine fiber network connecting over 40 markets, uh, within, uh, more than 50,000 kilometers of fiber optic cables. Um, we have a revenue of $4.4 billion and we have, uh, um, almost uh 10,000 employees. And we operate in different, uh, countries in Latin America with different brands as you can see, uh, in Costa Rica we operate under the name of Liberty and Puerto Rico, uh, Liberty also and the Bahamas is, uh, we operate as a BTC and in other, uh, part of the Caribbean as flow in Panama as Mass Moil. And for the B2B market, we uh uh we use the brand Liberty Business and Liberty Network is where. We cover all the Network fiber uh across the, the Caribbean, and another thing important is that Liberty Latin America is part of the Liberty Group, uh, but becomes an independent company in 2018, um, and at that moment is where we focus, um, in the Latin American market and in this presentation, uh, we are going to focus in specifically Puerto Rico which is the. Um, the, the, I would say the newest mobile operator that we have, and, and the challenge that we, that we face. In 2019, we acquired the AT&T mobile operation in, in, in Puerto Rico and at that time in Puerto Rico we were only a mobile, uh, we were not a mobile operator, we were just a fixed operator where we provided cable, uh, and fixed services. Um, and during that time when we acquired the, the, the new mobile network, we were operating under, uh, under a TSA with AT&T. Basically this this TSAs, uh, allow us to use the AT&T. Uh, BSES stack to continue the operation of the mobile platform, but this has a high, high cost for us and also has a specific end end date so we need to move fast. We need to, uh, migrate more than 2 million subscribers from the AT&T, IT stack to our own IT stack. Um, but at that time, we only have a BSES stack that was meant for fixed, uh, not for mobile, uh, mobile customers. Um, so it was not easy to escalate. It was on print. It was, um, not cloud native. So basically it was very, was very challenging for us to, to use that, uh, uh, IT stack to migrate all these customers and although the technical limitation that, that, that we have with this, uh, system is that we have a, uh. Uh, many customizations, um, um, and the time to market was, uh, super slow. It was not possible to launch a new product, new services, uh, because it requires a lot of customization. So that was not the right platform for us, basically because, uh, we need, we, we, we were looking to compete with, uh, other carriers in Puerto Rico like AT&T, Claro, so that, uh, platform was not, uh, the right fit or solution for us. Um, at the same time we have uh. New challenge for us uh because at that time we were only um uh fixed operator, but this time we were going to the to the mobile segment so for that we required to create a, a new charging or or to have a new charging new charging system. And that requires that to have at least 15 millisecond latency to connect all the calls. Um, basically for for those who don't know, the charging is the is the platform to authorize the transaction in real time. For data, voice, and SMS, so basically what we were looking for is to have a, a good customer experience, have our charging solution real to the EPC or the 5G cord, uh, to provide a better experience for the customer, um, and at the same time in Puerto Rico we, we face some challenge, right? We, we have, uh, Puerto Rico is a country that has faced many. Heavy storms, hurricanes, after the Hurricane Maria, we have a situation where the country was without power for many months. So that also requires to think about how we can build a high resiliency system. And for that, we, we, we use AWS Outpost where we implemented the high availability, uh, where we have 22 charging systems. Basically, the main one is in Puerto Rico, close to the EPC. The other one is in Miami, where we use a local zone. And with that in any situation like uh any condition like a a catastrophic event like a hurricane, we can, we can have a high availability, low latency, and this allows us to continue operating in Puerto Rico. So basically those were the, the challenge that we face um uh um after the decision of uh the, the AT&T network in Puerto Rico. Here you can see um the our full uh architecture and we start with Celforce, which is basically our product catalog, uh, and also is where we create all the product configurations. The later are distributed to the entire stack and also we use um Evertec as a payment gateway um for the order provisioning we also uh we also use uh Saforce and as a CRM where the customer care agents also can interact with uh all the, uh, we can sell we can also interact with the customers we can resolve the problem for the, uh, that we have in the network. And for the, for billing we use Aria. It's also a, a cloud platform where we build uh uh a monthly charges for customer. We send the, uh, the invoices and on top of that we have our OCS. That's where we are using a AWS output which is Matrix, so OCS, as I, as I said before, is the application that controls the interaction with the network. Um, we are doing the real time. All those events are, are rated in real time. They are pushed, uh, to area for, uh, for the correct billing of the customers, um, and we are using, we are leveraging, uh, all the, uh. Capabilities that we have available uh in in AWS like for example we use Apache Kafka to push the the transaction uh towards Zaria as a type of uh all the all the CDRs and uh we do the same for example we send all the, all the transactional CDRs, uh, to the data lake and we use a a Tina to query all that information. So basically this is the uh. What we build in Puerto Rico to support uh all the mobile operations, uh, I migrate all the subscribers from AT&T to the to the new IT stack that is full, uh, um, I would say cloud cloud base, um, with that I will, um, hand over this to my colleague, uh, Juan Gura. Thank you, sir. Hello everyone. My name is Juan. I'm the cloud governance and engineering manager for Liberty Latin America. So let's start talking about the foundation of this uh high performing solution. This is a hybridsolution. So the foundation is not the servers, the foundation are not the compute or other public cloud services. For us, the foundation for the solution is under the sea. We are Liberty Networks. We are an operation company for Liberty Latin America. And basically we operate an extensive low latency and redundant fabric interconnect across the region. So we include the most critical. Subsea cables in the region that connects the Caribbean with the Americas. So this full physical infrastructure is the key enabler for our resources with AWS. Talking about the challenge here. So the core challenge requires to link our mobile operations in Puerto Rico with the AWS Cloudhub, the Miami Localzone, with the highest possible performance. So in that way we had to treat this connection. As an extension of our local network. To the AWS facility in Miami. The whole solution. Leverage in our own subsea cables. So for this particular. We are using the ACOs. And the Americans, Americas too, the fiber capacity of those subsea cables to create a full redundant solution. And in that way we can guarantee the shortest and lowest jitter path between on premises again Puerto Rico. And they doA side in, in Miami. This proprietary network advantage allow us to implement the first pillar of this hybrid solution, which is the direct connect. So let's go deeper into the hybrid architecture. So the first component is on premises. What we have on premises in Puerto Rico are different data centers in different locations. On each location we also have core components of the mobile network including the DRA, the diameter routing agent, and also the STP, the signaling transfer point. So those core components need to talk with our charging system. So for that, we decide to implement our charging system, matrix in AWS Oppos also located in Puerto Rico. This, this is the active instance of the charging system. This solution is a containerized solution, so we are using EKS, we are using networking services, storage services, but also we decided to include another partners like F5 to manage all the signaling traffic. And also Mongo DB for the database layer. So at the end, the connection between the core mobile and the charging system is using the local gateway from AWS. And from there we are using our local network in Puerto Rico. So that gives us around 10 milliseconds of the network latency between both components, which is very good for the transactions. And the reason why basically is because this is our network, the local network in Puerto Rico, so that's the easy part. So we have the opposite with the activism of the charging system. And next, the challenge is the DR for the application. So the DR we decided to put in Miami local zone. We implement pretty much the same solution with the same AWS services, a containary solution, the same ecosystem of partners. So from there, we need to establish a replication between passive and active using for sure the network connections. So for the network connection we realize in our own subsea cable. On top of that, we have the transport network and also the NPLS. Finally, we go through the direct connect. For the direct connect, we have two connections, 10 gig connections to provide bandwidth and full redundancy path in the, in, in this way. The final tier here is the region. On top we see the region. So we are consuming also software as a service solution from different vendors like Jose mentioned before, like Area Salesforce. We are using our payment gateway, BSS components, CRM, but in parallel we also have internal workloads running on the region, OSS layer and also the mediation. Even other IT applications for the whole ecosystem. So we have Tier 1, the active instance of the charging system. Tier 2, the passive. Instance of the charging system, tier 3, the region, and finally connects with on-premise. So the full connection of these components, we rely on the transit gateway. For us, the transit gateway is the brain. To manage all the complexity in the routing of the traffic. We also are centralizing the traffic to do the inspection in the traffic using AWS network firewall. What we learn here from this hybrid architecture, so this infrastructure enables as a cloudinated. Telco, because now we, we have an an stack, a, a clothes stack, so we are creating. Uh, let's say a template for this solution so we can replicate this, this architecture on different markets on new acquisitions for other operations or or other mobile companies in the region. Also these hybrid services talking about the outposts, local zones, regions, the full ecosystem of partners. So we solve the constraints related with the low latency, the data resiliency, the resiliency of the solution, and also during the daily basis of the operation, we have the seamless failover and failback of the application. It's done. Do you want to the last one is, uh, proximity, agility over customization, um. Uh, one of the main, uh, components as I was mentioning was, uh, uh, is our, is our charging and for us, the important thing here was to have it, uh, close to the network, close to the EPT, to close to the 5G cord, and also uh. Sorry, uh, and, and also, um, the important thing is, um. Is that we choose uh cloud native vendors for the rest of the solution, not only for the OCS also for the for our BSCS for our our CRM for our payment gateway, uh, in order to follow a giant practice that uh allows to go to the market and. Within weeks if not months, and then we also Um, select those vendors because we, we learn from the past that, uh, from the previous, uh, legacy system that the customization is not good for our business, uh, make us, uh, move slow and for that reason is why we select all these vendors that was the last.
