summary: This presentation from AWS re:Invent 2025, delivered by AWS Solutions Architects Addie Penella and Martin Sakowski, explores the profound impact of AI on the e-commerce landscape. The session, titled "From UX to AX: MCP Servers for AI Shopping Agents," highlights the shift from optimizing for user experience (UX) to the new paradigm of agent experience (AX). The speakers argue that this is the most significant transformation in e-commerce since the advent of mobile, and they provide a roadmap for businesses to navigate this change without having to rebuild their entire infrastructure. The presentation begins by highlighting some startling statistics that underscore the urgency of this shift. A significant portion of Gen Z customers are already starting their product searches on AI platforms like ChatGPT and Perplexity, rather than on retailer websites. The speakers also cite predictions of a massive increase in e-commerce sales flowing through AI agents in the coming years. This is coupled with a decline in traditional search engine traffic and click-through rates, indicating a clear shift in consumer behavior. The message is clear: the way customers discover and purchase products is changing, and businesses need to adapt quickly to stay relevant. The core of the session revolves around the concept of "Agent Experience" (AX). The speakers explain that as AI shopping agents become more prevalent, businesses need to think about how their products and services are presented to these agents. This means structuring data in a way that is easily consumable by AI, providing clear and concise product information, and ensuring that the purchasing process is seamless for AI agents. The session delves into the technical details of how to achieve this, with a focus on the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The speakers explain how MCP servers can be used to provide a standardized way for AI models to access and interact with e-commerce platforms. The presentation is not just theoretical; it provides practical advice and actionable insights for businesses. The speakers emphasize that the transition to AX does not necessarily require a complete overhaul of existing systems. Instead, they advocate for a phased approach that involves gradually adapting to the new reality of AI-driven commerce. The session is a wake-up call for anyone in the e-commerce industry, urging them to start thinking about their AX strategy today. The speakers' deep understanding of the topic, combined with their practical advice, makes this a must-see presentation for anyone looking to future-proof their e-commerce business.

Good afternoon, everyone. Can you all hear me all right? All right, excellent. Let's do a show of hands first. How many of you here in the last one month have used a chat GPT or um or perplexity to find a specific product that you're looking for? OK, quite a few hands. Keep those hands up. How many of you have actually had AI purchase it for you? None, 0. Exactly. That's the gap, uh, and we are gonna talk about that specific gap which represents the biggest shift in e-commerce since the mobile revolution. My name is Addie Penella. This is Martin Sakowski. We are solutions architects from AWS and today we are going to talk to you about the seismic shift and all the work that you've been doing on user experience and why that is being reimagined to agent experience and most importantly what you could do to navigate this shift in order to not let you rebuild the whole thing all over again just because agents are coming over. Before we go into the thick of things, I want to quickly talk a little bit about the state of e-commerce today. The first thing that I want to highlight is 51% of Gen Z customers are starting their product search in AI platforms. They're not on your site, they're starting off their product searches in an AI platform. And then we are estimating about $500 billion in annual sales, uh, through 2030. It's just 4 years away. Think about that. And Gartner predicts that about 25-30% of all e-commerce will flow through agents in the near future, and this is where it gets really interesting. OpenAI reported that their product searches on their platform have been growing 3-40% year over year continuously and what's more. The traditional channels are declining. What does that mean? That means the Google product searches, one you know, driving traffic to retailer site, are down by 23% year over year. And even more important, the click through is down by 30% year over year. So what does that mean? Where's the traffic? Is the traffic disappearing? People are not buying anymore? No, people are buying. It's just that the traffic that used to be generated and directed to your site through these traditional channels are no longer happening. There is shopping. They're just still browsing, but they're not doing the same way they used to. So what does this mean for e-commerce builders? What does it mean for us? Over the last two decades we've been perfecting the art of user experience. We've implemented great visual design, rich colors, nice images, and so on and so forth. We built smooth navigation and we've extracted every single millisecond possible out of the page load times so that our SEO, you know, is, is great. Guess what? Agents don't care about any of that. So what's happening? It's the fundamental shift from user experience. To agent experience. So what is agent experience? What do they care about? They care about good API design. They care about structured data. What that means, your data needs to be proper, it needs to be up to date, and it needs to be reliable. And the agents must find a way to interact with your data. So what does that mean? That means you need to have some kind of protocol that is able to expose that data to the agents so that they can interact with your data. This is the shift from user experience to agent experience. And it is super important. And if your website does not adapt to agent experience, your site will disappear for about 1/3 of all e-commerce traffic. Before we get to the thick of things and talk to you about how you could actually solve this, how could you implement this, I want to give you a quick sneak peek, again, a sneak peek at some of the protocols in the Asian platform. You might have heard several platforms out there, protocols out there, but I want to highlight just the four of them here because these are the most popular and have the most traction, uh, right now. The top two protocols you'll see, the ACP and uh AP-2, are commerce specific protocols. ACP, uh, is, uh, from OpenAI and Stripe. They've released it and open sourced the protocol, and they're specific for product searches and checkout flows. And then you have AP 2, which is from Google, which helps with Google payment flows. In the bottom, you have two other protocols which are more generic, the ACP, uh, sorry, A2A, which is, again, Google's own protocol, uh, open source, which lets agents to communicate with one another. And then finally the MCP MCP stands for model context protocol again released and open sourced by anthropic. This I call is the Swiss knife of protocols. Why? Because it's not built just to do one single thing like, you know, a check out or like a payment. This is set up and built to do several things, uh, setting up your foundations, security, and so on and so forth. So this is where we're gonna double click today and talk, talk to you about why MCP is something that is super important for you all to understand and how you could leverage MCP to move forward and get to the point where you would be ready. I'll let Martin double click on MCP and take you further, and I'll be back to summarize and talk a little bit more about best practices. So what exactly is MCP? So MCP has 3 core capabilities. The first one is resources. So think of resources as readable data sources, that could be your product catalog, that could be your inventory or the order history, something where you can do a get request and you just get the same data without having right permissions on it. Then there's tools. Tools are different. Where you can interact. The tools are actions for the MCP server, so you can, for instance, say add to cart. That is an action an agent can do or process the payment or update the inventory. That would be um tools that you can have in MCP. And then there are prompts. Prompts are pre-built interaction patterns that help the agent to effectively use your tools and your data sources. Well, there's something important to notice, and often MCP servers are not labeled like this. There is local MCP and remote MCP. So local MCP is where the MCP server runs locally on your computer. So that is actually the majority of MCP servers. That you find on the internet, on GitHub, and they're great for local automation on your computer, but they're not helpful at all. For gentic commerce use cases, so because the shopping agents like Perplexity or Chat GPT, they are running somewhere else, and they need to connect via the internet, via the network to your e-commerce site and your MCP server. So remote MCP is what you need to make this communication happen. So let's say we have this remote MCP server, we put it in front of our e-commerce APIs, and now AI shopping agents can talk to our. Backend systems, problem solved, right? Well, maybe not completely, um there are some challenges. For instance, security. Well security is important, um how do you handle authentication? How do you handle authorization, because an agent that is allowed to search for, for some products on your website might need completely different permissions than an agent that is allowed to buy something for a specific user, or observability. If an agent is buying something and it might not be exactly what the user wanted. You want to trace this from the intent that the user put into the agent. Than what the agent did the task to the MCP server and down to your retail system, you want to understand that flow exactly, or scalability, well, Those patterns will change completely, as Adi mentioned, um, so with agents we're seeing completely different patterns. Humans can click like let's say 2030 times a minute. Agents can run thousands or 10 thousands of requests in parallel, and imagine how this will affect your MCP server during peak hours, or even worse, during Black Friday weekend or evolution. Protocols will evolve, we have seen that, like the protocols are changing quite fast and your online shop capabilities will evolve over the time, and shopping agents will evolve, and you have to make sure you're always compatible with all of them, because if you're not, you're missing out on those customers. So the good news is, you don't have to solve all these problems by your own, because Amazon Bedrock agent called Gateway comes in, and I can promise you. It makes your life a lot easier. Why? First, you don't need to write those MCP servers by yourself, you don't need to write them from scratch. Um just take an existing API and you have that already, or um existing lambda functions, and agent core gateway automatically converts those APIs or those lambda functions in MCP compatible tools. So you have a product search API. This can easily become an MCP tool for product search, or you have a checkout API. This would be an MCP tool for checkout. And the second one, an agent called Gateway gives you a single secure endpoint for all the interactions that an agent can do. So we have built-in authentication for your agents, security, and built an authorization and so on, and all of this is managed for you. So the agent doesn't need to figure out like where to get all of this, it only talks to one interface. And you can control what the agent can do in your environment. And then the third one I like the most is a context aware discovery. Well, think of like all the tools you can build. There will be many tools that you have to expose. Think of all the APIs that you already have. The gateway understands what the agent is trying to do, and then it only surfaces the right tools. That you need for that interaction and it serves them with the right permission. So if the customer asks like find me shoes for under $100 it offers you product search, of course, and inventory check and price filters and the checkout flow. But the agent never sees the tool how to return the product or for the order tracking, because you haven't yet ordered a product, so you don't need those tools and you don't want to confuse the agent with like all those tools that are not required for that particular intent. Let me show you how that works in practice. So on the left hand we have an agent with MCP like that could be Claudechat GPT, your own custom agent. In the middle we have agent core gateway, um, and this is the magic layer where like all this translation happens, and it exposes a single MCP endpoint that fluently speaks that MCP protocol. And on the right hand side, well, we have our existing infrastructure, our RTful APIs, or our lambda functions. So for the REST APIs for this API endpoint targets, um, you have to use your open API specification, and then Agent Core gateway automatically exposes them, translates them to MCP tools, so you don't have to write the code for that. For the lambda targets, you might have some serverless functions in your back and um maybe for custom business logic, price calculations, promotions, recommendation engines and so on. Agent Core Gateway can directly invoke them and can wrap them as an MCP tool. So the beauty here is, The backend that you have built in the past doesn't see the change, so you keep like all your APIs, you keep all your lambda functions exactly as they are, and agent Core gateway does all of the translation. And if we're looking at our problems, security, scalability, observability and evolution, you're all covered by agent Core Gateway. So, How to get started, if you want to build this for your e-commerce environment. So the first step is think of your APIs. What are the capabilities you want to expose? What are the APIs that you already have, that you can expose, and then um find the open API specification for that, um, for your product catalog, for your inventory, for your checkout, for order tracking, and so on. You most likely have those specifications already. If not, you have an API. Generating that specification is straightforward. Second step, think of authentication, and we have two layers here. So the first one is the inbound authentication. So you have to find out like how the agent authenticates to your gateway. An agent core gateway can auto provision cognito or the OOS flow, so you can, or you bring your own providers, so that's how the agent um interacts with the agent core gateway. And then the outbound authentication is how the gateway, Authenticates towards your backend APIs, you can use API keys, you can use OOs or whatever you're using today. And then the third step, Well, you have to set up agent core, so like get those API specifications, point it towards the number functions, then use the console CLI SDK um for testing, but in production, please use infrastructure as code like CDK to set it up. And then Agent Core gateway automatically passes whatever you gave to the agent core gateway and exposes those tools to that endpoint. And then the last step is, you get an MCP endpoint URL. Use that URL and connect it. To Cloud, to chat GBT and so on, or your own um agent framework, and then test how good are your APIs performing with an agent, and maybe you find out they're performing very well, or you might find out they're not yet built for agents, so maybe improve the API because the API itself doesn't change, it's just a tool how you, how you communicate with that, so that's what you can test. So it's not that difficult to start. With an MCP server and expose your e-commerce capabilities to an agent. Well, we have built a lot of MCP servers in the past, and Adi will share some of the learnings we have done. Yes, so we've, we've built several MCP servers internally within AWS, uh, and we've tried what works, what doesn't work, and so on and so forth. So what I want to quickly talk a little bit about are some of the best practices that we have seen really help us, and I'm sure these will help you too. The first one is, uh, design agent first APIs. What that means is you typically would need, um, structured data, data semantics, and rich metadata. What does that mean? That means, let's say you have a schema and you have price as one of the fields. You do not want your data sometimes to come as a text, as a string, and sometimes as a number. Agents are literal. What that means is they can't understand what your intent is at this point in time, so you would have to make sure your data is proper and is accurate. If you have your data as a number, but it represents as a string, you're gonna have problems. So ensure your data is structured and rich. Next, progressive disclosure. What does that mean? Crazy term, right? What that means is, do not just expose your entire API ecosystem through the MCP yet. Start small. Identify those specific APIs that you think will create the biggest impact. Product metadata. Um, product details, maybe pricing, maybe check out, right? Just pick 4 or 5 ones and let the end user agents interact with these APIs, see how they work, see, uh, the error rate, see the success criteria, measure the success, and see how they perform, and you will be surprised how different these agents interact with your data as compared to a compared to a human. So ultimately you expose these APIs, try out a few things, learn from those, and then add those APIs that you think are most relevant. That gives you the best approach because you're not handling several 100 APIs at one time, but managing on those things that actually create an impact. Next is multi-protocol support. You've seen, uh, the 4 protocols that we talked about before. There are quite a few out there already. There will be more. So there will be consolidation down the line. Now we are not in a state at this point in time to say, oh this protocol is a clear winner, absolutely not. So we're not recommending our customers to choose one protocol over the other. However, be flexible, be ready for those protocols that might come tomorrow that might become the de facto standard. So what you would need to do, make sure your foundation is set right. You uh abstract away all the complexity through agent core and set your foundation right so that way tomorrow another protocol comes in and that becomes a de facto standard, it's plug and play for you and not something where you would have to reinvent the whole thing again. So just to summarize the session, key takeaways. User experience to agent experience is real. It's inevitable. It's happening right now. MCP gives you the ability to provide that strong foundation so that you don't have to reinvent the whole wheel, but MCP comes with those challenges. That's where you can leverage Bedrock Agent Core to remove that complexity, have all the ability to, uh, offload all the complex tasks to Agent Core gateway and just focus on that piece which is your business logic which drives you forward and finally. It's not about whether you will build agents or build uh e-commerce for agents. It's about when. Now, 20 minutes doesn't do justice for agent e-commerce. There's so much to deep dive on it, we just barely scratched the surface. We understand that. So me and Martin actually wrote a blog, co-authored a blog on the same topic. It goes into a little bit more detail. So you scan the QR code, it'll take straight to the blog post where you talk about implementation, the things that you need to consider, and so on and so forth. So please take a read, um, let us know if you have any questions, comments right there in the blog. And we'll stick around for a few more minutes if you have any questions. So thank you for your time and uh good luck with your implementations.
