summary: "In this session, leaders from AbbVie and Accenture unveil 'Gaia,' an enterprise-grade Generative AI platform built to revolutionize the creation of clinical and regulatory documentation. Darian Johnson (Accenture), Dr. Chris Sinclair, and Steven Troy (AbbVie) describe the journey of building a system that moves beyond simple isolated chatbots to a robust, scalable 'Lego block' architecture capable of automating complex, high-stakes deliverables. The primary motivation is the 'high stakes' of patient health; accelerating the drafting of documents like Clinical Study Reports (CSRs) directly translates to getting life-saving drugs to market faster. The platform currently automates 26 document types, with an ambitious roadmap to scale to over 350 types by 2030, projecting an annual saving of 115,000 labor hours. This expansive roadmap encompasses everything from periodic safety update reports to new drug application annual reports, fundamentally reshaping the R&D landscape.

The architecture of Gaia is designed for flexibility and scale, leveraging AWS Serverless and Amazon Bedrock. Rather than a monolithic tool, it uses a modular approach where different 'blocks' of functionality (data ingestion, logic application, formatting) can be reassembled for different document types. A critical technical evolution discussed is the shift from 'Prompt Engineering' to 'Context Engineering.' The team realized that simple prompts hit a performance plateau, only achieving 70-80% accuracy. To bridge the gap, they implemented sophisticated context engineering techniques, likely involving knowledge graphs and vector retrieval, to feed the LLMs with precise, structured data from over 90 internal sources. This ensures the model isn't just hallucinating text but is grounding its generation in master data.

A significant portion of the talk focuses on the operational and cultural challenges of deploying AI in a GxP-regulated industry. Steven Troy highlights that 'AI is hard, and AI for regulated industries is extremely hard.' Gaia is explicitly designed as a 'human-in-the-loop' system. It does not replace the medical writer; rather, it produces a high-quality first draft—reducing manual effort by up to 90%—which is then reviewed and finalized by human experts. This workflow maintains compliance while delivering massive efficiency. The speakers also candidly discuss managing organizational 'FOMO' (Fear Of Missing Out) and the rigorous change management required to teach scientists how to interact with AI, moving them from skepticism to trusting the tool as a 'co-pilot.'

Looking to the future, the team is integrating 'AI Agents' into the development pipeline itself, using agents to write code and configure new document types, thereby accelerating the platform's own evolution. They also touch on the concept of 'Headless Generation,' where documents are generated automatically in the background triggered by system events, rather than requiring a user to log in and click a button. The session concludes with a strong message: success requires a dedicated cross-functional team, continuous feedback loops from business users, and a platform mindset that anticipates rapid technological change. The collaboration between AbbVie and Accenture demonstrates that even in highly regulated environments, agile innovation is possible."

And we will get started. Um, this is low key, so, um, we wanna hear your questions. We have some time at the end for questions, um, but looking forward to having a conversation with everybody, looking forward to sharing. Um, what we've done, uh, with Gitor of AI and with the Genic AI, uh, my name's Darian Johnson. Uh, I play a couple of different roles. I'm with Accenture. I've been with Accenture for 25 years, um, in our AWS practice the last 10 years. Um, I spend quite a bit of time doing AWS work for a large number of clients. Um, I spend a lot of time. at ABV overseeing our technology portfolio, uh, but my, my job that I'm happiest about the most is that I spend most of my time working with these gentlemen on Gaia. Gaia is a document generation platform that Abby's built, um, that's helping them to change, uh, their business, transform their business. Chris and Steven will talk about that in a few minutes. I'm gonna introduce them. I'm gonna talk about our agenda, and then we'll go from there. In fact, I will do agenda first. Um, and then I'll do introductions. Um, our goal is to talk a little bit about why we've done this, how Abby's going to be using them in their, in their business. We'll talk about the technology, we'll talk about the challenges because we wanna be transparent about that as well, and then we'll have some time at the end to talk about where we're going with the platform and have some time for questions. So the goal is to. Spend the next 30, uh 35, 40 minutes kind of presenting some stuff to you and then leaving the last 15 to 20 minutes for your questions. We've got some canned questions. We want your questions as well. I mean if there's something pressing that you need to ask right in the middle of a slide, I guess you can, but we will have plenty of time at the end to to answer questions and we can go back on any slide if you wanna double click on any part of it. Um, I've already introduced myself, um, the two other, uh, gentlemen presenting with me. Um, first one is, uh, Doctor Chris Sinclair. He is a vice president in Abby's R&D organization. He leads the global therapeutics platform, part of R&D, the D part, the development part of R&D. Chris has been with Abby and Abbott for over 26 years, and he is known as a positive disruptor, thrives on tackling. Uh, complex challenges across diverse functions from R&D, regulatory, IT, finance, medical affairs. That's the stuff on his LinkedIn. Let me tell you the real stuff about Chris. Uh, Chris's superpower is that he is really good at getting at the so what. He's able to take a lot of information in very, very quickly, determine what that information means, give us a recommendation, give us a point of view, help guide us on our approach or strategic thinking. That's what Chris is awesome at. Um, my friend, Steven Troy, Steven is the director of AI for Abby's IR organization within R&D. And works with Chris. Uh, Steven has spearheaded a lot of the programs, technology and AI programs, uh, in R&D at Abbey, including Gaia. This is his baby, um, and I'm very privileged to work with him on his baby. Um, Steven's superpower. Like Stephen's done a lot over the last 18 years. He's been in industry, uh, he's been in consulting. He's done work with insurance, he's done work with life sciences, he's done work with utilities. He has a very opinionated point of view on how to solve, use AI for regulated industries. That's a big, big deal because, uh, AI is hard. AI for regulated industries are is extremely difficult, so he brings that perspective, his way of thinking, his, his thinking just helps us, you know, solution better and help us deliver, helps us to deliver. So, um, with that, I'm gonna stop talking. I'm gonna hand over to Chris and then let him continue. All right, all good. So very rarely am I introduced as Doctor anything, um. You know, when I went to graduate school, my dad was a blue collar worker, and, and I said the only person I'm gonna make call me doctor is you, dad, and he says, I'll call you Doctor Bonehead, um, and that was 30 years ago, and, and I've never been called doctor since except today, so thank you. Uh, Mom will be proud, Darren. I appreciate that, um. Uh, first, thanks for coming. Um, you guys could go to a lot of places. There are, you know, a massive number of talks, and, you know, you guys coming here, we see that as, you know, our responsibility to you to, to give you something useful. So, uh, just know that we're, we're appreciative of that and, and respect that, uh, that commitment you made to us, um. You know, Steven, Steven said he'd give me as many slides as I wanted, but, but this is really his baby, um, you know, he has been the heart, soul, and face of Gay, and it's only appropriate to have, um, Steven really present this work. Um, what, what I wanted to do briefly, and, and he was a little nervous because you never know what will happen when I get in front of a, a microphone, um, but, but since we're in Las Vegas, I, uh, I thought, you know, I think we should go see a show, we should go see a play, right? Um, and I like having fun with a purpose, and so there are 3 characters and they just have to be 3 characters up on stage, um, so I'll be the villain, all right, so I am FOMO, um, I am the fear of missing out. I am the astronomically high expectations around the magic that is supposed to transform all of our lives with AI, right? I'm the person who's pushing and pushing and saying, why can't you do more faster and transform everything. Right, so I'm, I'm the villain. Um, we need a love interest. Darren, I'm, I, you know, congratulations, you're the love interest. Um, Darren is the high stakes. He's the real world impact that it's going to have and in my life I work in pharmaceuticals. I'm part of R&D. I'm, I'm in the IT function, um, but, but what we are trying to do is we're trying to get drugs to market to help patients live better lives, OK? And, and so, you know, everything we can do to make that faster or cheaper is what those real world high stakes are. That's, that's daring the love interest. Um, now, together, we, we, you know, we have, we put a lot of pressure, we put a lot of expectations on the hero and the hero will be Steven, or I just call him poor IT Steve. Um, so poor IT IT Steve has to, you know, weather the villain who's, who's like, Steven, we're not going fast enough. I'm very nervous what's going to happen and And the love interest is like Steven please help me the patients are waiting, right? But, but what is it that Steven has to do? um, and like any good story it's been this sort of long process of learning and overcoming trials, um, and, and really struggling in many ways and you know sometimes when I come to presentations like this and somebody shows me what what they've done and what's happened. Um, it all looks like it went so smoothly, and, and I don't wanna give the impression that it was terrible. It wasn't terrible, but there were days when we're like, man, is this program gonna live or die? Like, should we prioritize this or not? Um, we had a lot of ups and downs. And so what I'm hoping we can do is help people understand maybe you're not alone because I suspect that this play that I just described is also in your hometown, right? I bet you have FOMO showing up at your companies, right? Um, I bet you have a love interest of high stakes and people saying we need this faster, please help us, and I suspect there are a lot of IT Steve's in the room, so maybe some poor IT Steves. Oh my gosh, right? Um, so, so this play that you're gonna see and, and really hear about in a much more professional way from Steven. Um, just know you're not alone. Uh, that's kind of 12, we're here to learn from each other. I mean, what's great about coming to these conferences is because we can see what went well and what didn't go well, um, and then kind of the last piece is, you know, sometimes we can get a little depressed about AI, right? AI. Change everything we get a singularity and we're all living in caves, right? That's the scary part of, of AI. But I was at a talk not long ago and the person was, was talking about the humans are still in charge. You guys are still in charge. We are still in charge of what we're going to do with our generative AI platform, um, and so that's very powerful, um, so, so that's kind of the backdrop to this and then, and then the slide that I'll, I'll show about more specifically so we call it Gaia, it's our generative AI platform. Um, and its intent is to, you know, when, when the vision that we had early on was we didn't want a point solution, we had a lot of people coming to us and saying we will automate this document for you. We know that this, this thing called a CSR is, is a real pain in the, in the tush, and so we'll help automate that one thing, and we thought, you know, CSR won't be the end of the story. It's just. Beginning we will have hundreds if not thousands of documents. In fact, if you look at clinical study startup alone, we have 87 documents that are part of that for every clinical study, OK? That's just one piece of what we have to automate. So one document wasn't going to get it. We needed a platform, a way that we could do lots of documents repeatedly over time. That was the idea behind a generative AI platform. Um, the other piece I'll say is, is, you know, as you go on a journey, um, you gotta have partners. We, we, you know, our old CIO would say if you wanna go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. Um, and so we partnered with AWS, we partnered with Accenture, we knew that we could work hard and we were smart, but we couldn't work hard enough and we weren't smart enough without some experts, right? And so that's why I think when you go on this journey you're gonna wanna find folks that, that can, can fit that role, um, and then that last piece is. You know, really expanding and digging in, you know, after we got kind of the initial successes, now it's, boy, what else can it do, right? And, and on top of that is all of the things that are changing, right? It, it was prompt engineering. Now it's context engineering, you know, now it's agents. I heard somebody talking about quantum compute. Oh my goodness, I hope I'm retired before quantum compute happens, but. Um, you know, it, it, it's changing so fast. So, so, you know, that's the piece that, that as these guys are trying to build this platform, how do you create something that can adapt and change over time? It isn't out of date the moment you put it in place, um, so that's been a pretty big challenge, um, so that's my introduction to Gaia, and now I'll turn over to a much more professional speaker, uh, Steven. Now we're gonna leave the stage, we're gonna leave you up here alone, Steven, so good luck, but bring us back when there's questions, OK? You promise? OK, thank you. All right, so, um, as Chris was saying, we started this journey to transform the way we work and ultimately that transformation started with our R&D documents and specifically clinical documents, um, with this journey, and then we'll go to the next slide here, we've started this and by the end of this calendar year we'll have automated 26 documents, uh, types in our platform. So putting the bet in on a platform that could scale is, is starting to show that it will pay off. Um, that is on track to save us 20,000 hours per year, um, for those 26 documents, and we have a pretty ambitious growth timeline here. Um, we're looking by 2030 to automate well over 350 documents and save over 115,000 hours from our teams. Um, some of the examples beyond, you know, what you heard around CSR, uh, of our periodic safety update reports, uh, new drug application annual reports, uh, EUCTRs, SSLs, ICF, and ISFs just to name a few. Basically we're looking at all of the documents and prioritizing them for study startup and then for the rest of the clinical trial process and then the rest of R&D, but this is really focused on a few different areas so we're looking to reduce our cycle times, um, increase the standardization and the maintenance of quality so you know a lot of these documents are regulatory in nature, um, but we do know that we can reduce most of the manual effort for these documents by up to 90% per document right now. We also know that across this continuum of the drafting cycle, this first, the time to first draft is the majority of what's in this blue and purple. On the right, some of the metrics here are around what types of things we're seeing when people are drafting these documents. Over 65% of them have multiple data sources. Over 72% of them have different data elements such as tables, charts, figures, and data blocks. So when we looked at how we set up Gaia, we had this idea of doing, um, like a Lego block approach where we have reusable components, um, and that gets us into a little bit around how we deliver that first draft automation. So for when somebody goes to create a first draft of a document, we had to talk to people because off the shelf there really isn't, you know, people say, oh we have a business process that business process has been written down we can tell you how this works well, in a lot of cases there's a box that says today is the day you write the document, tomorrow is the day that you give it to somebody else, and they start their review process. How somebody actually writes it or if you were treating or training a new hire on how to write that document, usually those types of requirements aren't written down somewhere. So when we looked at how do we deliver this, we knew that there is a set up um that needed to be done around the document type and the scope that we're gonna automate and how it's initiated. We had to look at the different types of data that get ingested so when somebody's writing a section of a document, where do they go look? Do they go to spreadsheets? Do they go to the master data in the database? Do they get it off of a napkin, which is, you know, you'd be surprised where they write things down, um. And then that data we're pulling it into our AI system and we're transforming it so we're using AI to then interpret that data, apply the business logic by a section of a document to then generate it and stitch it back together. So when we were looking at this and explaining it to our business teams. Um, we essentially look at a document, decompose it into its table of contents, and then facilitate through conversations around a day in the life of somebody writing this, and what are the unique things that happen? Do the documents vary by therapeutic area? Do they vary by product type? Um, do they vary by study? So all that types of information goes into the requirements that we have to capture, um. One of the things that we heard all the time is if AI is so smart, why do you need to give it instructions? Well, as many of you know, this will only work as well as we can guide it, especially for something that's generative. So we do need to get some level of, of these instructions because we also need to automate some of the quality checking at the end of this. Um, Gaia is a human in the loop platform. Um, it is what we're calling GXP ready, which is something that we've kind of coined this term because we know that right now the generative nature of this is not, um, something that you could validate in life sciences, um, but we are preparing for that with the way that we do our, our SLC and the way that we built the platform itself. So what I'll show you next is, um. These are some screenshots of our system and so the system we built it to be um intuitive um once somebody logs in they're presented with the documents they're allowed to create so we do have um role based access control in here um they come in and they select the document in this case we've got the PSUR document on here um they're able to select from this library of documents, then the next screen shows them. Sections that are AI enabled, um, we will output the entire document. Sometimes the business wanted to work on this iteratively with us and automate a couple of the sections and then do the rest later. Um, we have the idea of generating an entire document or parts of a document if they need to regenerate it later. And then uh as they go through this, um, this intuitive prompt-based kind of interface lets them, um, select different criteria for the creation of their document and then it generates it and allows them to download it. As I was talking about at the beginning, there are some key building blocks that we, we were saying that were important to how we build this. Um, I'll go through a few of them here. So with the UI, we want to make sure that it had this role-based security because there's certain documents that need to be secure. Um, we also needed to have support for this in browser rendering and downloading. Um, because we're looking to future capabilities. Do we want people to be able to edit this inside of their browser before they download it if they want to regenerate it and things of that nature? We have a document orchestrator which is one of the core components that allows us to, um, configure every document and it defines the order of operations for how we create the documents themselves. We have a prompt library, an enterprise prompt library that extends into Gaia and out from Gaia. So when we're working on prompts, they can be shared with the organization, um, and that allows us to now hook that up into some of our agents. We use AWS serverless infrastructure. We have an integration layer with an API hub that connects to our data sources. We've created this, uh, robust feature catalog so as our developers and teams are working on. On different tools inside the platform we're making sure that we can expose them in a reusable way. Um, our company has set up a LLM router and garden, so essentially we have a place where we can go and select whichever LLM we need um through Bedrock. And then ultimately, uh, this agentic catalog that we're putting in place, um, to help us with, uh, different tasks and some of our coding. This is the overall architecture. So this has evolved over time. Um, the interesting thing about this is we started out, we knew that we had to build this, um, anticipating the the changing nature of the technology, and that has allowed us to, um, you'll see the, the yellow boxes here integrate these agentic components into the architecture. Um, a lot of these things are probably pretty standard, but we're building this on a react UI with, uh, UI lambdas. We have the Bedrock agent core runtime that we're pulling in. We have the orchestrator at the top that's really the, that brings everything back together. We have the, um, below that the stores configurations, libraries, our transient storage, uh, the MCP servers and our feature catalog. One of the design principles we had when we started this is that this was a document creation platform that creates the first drafts. This was not intended to become a document repository. Um, because of the data that we're pulling in, we had to also make some decisions around data recency and making sure we were getting the master data to generate, um, the documents with quality. So because of that, we pull the data in real time. Um, into our system, then it's processed using the AI. The system generates the document and we have temporary retention periods from either 24 hours or up to 30 days based on the type of document that was generated and then the business teams are able to download it. Um, that was done purposely because of that, um, and also, uh, to make sure that we have the freshest data if somebody needs to come back and regenerate a file. Outside of our system we've integrated into a number of different um places our document repositories, literature, our data lakes, um, our different management systems, uh, the LLMs as I mentioned, and to our prompt library. On this journey, um, we have seen that, like I said with the nature of the system, it has to evolve so we've been adding agents to help accelerate our document design and development process. We've are embarking further into context engineering. I know it's the new hot term, um, but we were noticing that the documents are getting to uh to a 70 to 80% plateau in terms of how much insight you can get out of LLMs alone. And so the context engineering has been an important part of our journey um as we look at vectors, graphs, um, and other methods to identify and include these deeper insights into our outputs. We're also designing this as a self-learning platform that can be informed by human feedback, um, to improve the draft generation and the prompts that we're using. This is enabled to scale across the enterprise, um, so we started this and seeded this project with R&D knowing that it was intended to scale to the rest of the company and so we're in that part of the journey now so we're continuing to, you know, double down on the R&D documents, but the, the rest of ABV is to be able to take advantage of the system. We are continuing to integrate more of our data sources into the platform as well. There's over 90 of them now, um, and allow us to do headless document generation. So sometimes documents do not be generated by somebody logging into a UI. You would like to know that something happens on a normal cadence. We can leverage Gaia's technologies to create documents and place them supposed to be, whether that's somebody's inbox, a downstream system, um, etc. We're also looking at if uh domain specific language models should power any of our context aware automations. This is the area that we're we're exploring, um, but it's part of the context engineering, uh, I guess maturity process and, and that's one that's, um, kind of further down on the list for us to explore. So now I wanna talk a little bit about what we've learned, um. As Chris was mentioning, this has been a journey, um, one that we've been on for almost 2 years at this point. It started out as this idea where we literally had one document that people want to automate and we had to step back and say, do we really wanna put all of our eggs in one basket here, um. The decision to do this as a platform with with our partners was to to diversify the offering and to make sure that we had something that was scalable um the change management around AI and what document authoring meant was a key part of the success of this program, um. I can't under or understate how valuable this is, you know, you're talking to business team members that maybe have never played around with, um, something like chat GPT or or whatever else, right, and you're now trying to explain to them we're gonna help you generate part of the thing that you did for your core job as a medical writer, um, and so explaining to them how AI generates documents, what insight means, is it actually intelligent. Um, you know, like I said earlier, when people say why do you need to keep telling AI what to do, um, the education here was really important and so that is something that we have invested in a lot, um, we've done workshops, we've let people play around, um, we've shown them how to plan trips, you know, it's something that's very real to them to then take that idea, can you, if you can plan a trip and you get the idea of prompt engineering, what does that mean? How could you change your prompts to get a better trip plan? That made it easier for people to understand when we started to explain to them how to apply that to um the subject matter in their specific domain. We spent a lot of time around value realization, you know, when this started out it was, can you save this money and we're and we're going to anticipate that you will, and so we might take it away from you right now. Um, I would say that that was not the way to go about this. Um, we had a business case that said you should save this amount of time and amount of money. Um, across that journey we found that certain things are easier to automate than others. We found that some of the initial assumptions were probably not fully baked and so there has to be some agility in the value strategy and some reassessment baseline periods where you look at the automatable percent of a document. How much we're actually going to automate as part of the document journey and then another measurement afterwards for how much human in the loop still remains for people to create that document and take it over the finish line. Establishing a team that's done this before, um, this one is a bit of a challenge, right? We have new technology. You can't just always take what we've done before and apply it to something like this. Um, we are doing this with Agile, uh, 2 week sprints. We are doing this with a wide variety of people and so because of the learning curve we needed to stack the project with people that were able to learn quick, um, and who could bring this kind of diversity and skills and abilities to the project. Um, everyone is working in the new, so that is something, you know, how can we accelerate some of what we're doing with some of the AI for ourselves and so we've looked at agents and automation to help us across our delivery framework as well. The business participation and development is also extremely important. Uh, you wanna take the business along in your journey if they see this as a black box where then all of a sudden they just see the outcome, they don't get to learn how this actually happens, um, so showing them, uh, demos early and often throughout the sprint cycles is very important, um, and that has helped us with ensuring that we have a success around the measurement of the quality of a section of a document after it's automated. This definition of accuracy, writing style and formatting early, um. As much as some of these documents are regulated, everyone has their special sauce that they add into the document. And we work with to understand what accuracy means and the and the style for our company that is something that we had to inject into the way that the LM LLMs output that back in consistently across our documents. We don't want part of the documents that come out of Gaia to sound different than the rest of the documents. They have to have the, the Av ways of, of speaking and so that is, uh, something that we've focused on as well. Um, the learnings here, they really span across all of these, um, I think that one thing that has been really important as well is we separated this business writing design from the technical design to help facilitate people through how would you explain how you wrote something to a new hire, um, and then get that into our system. Um, the technical design work has led itself to then now be automatable to an extent by some of the agents that we're working on, and so that has really helped us in this overall journey. I think we're a little bit ahead of time, but we did want to open this up for questions and I was gonna invite Chris and Darien back up here, um, and at that point we could start taking questions.
