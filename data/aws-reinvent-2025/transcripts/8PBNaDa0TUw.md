Hello. Um, this is the reimagining large-scale migration planning with Agenec AI, um, sessions, so hopefully you're all here for that. Um, so what do we mean by, um, reimagining migration planning? Um, you know, migration planning has traditionally been a very manual process. Migrations take a long time. There's a lot of information in various places, and you create large teams and you share information with each other, write scripts, figure out, you know, in Excel spreadsheets, how to do migrations. But with the, with the advent of generative AI and very, uh, you know, agentic AI assistance, things are changing quite a bit. The assistant, uh, the human being that you used to interact with to figure all these things out can now be an agent. So you could use agentic AI to, to really do your migration planning a lot more seamlessly, and that's what we're gonna talk about here today. My name is Tusharaksenna. I lead the uh AWS Transform uh mic um. I reverse transform migration service team. And my name is John Lynch Shapiro Ward. I lead discovery, assessments and planning as part of ADBS Transform for migrations. Cool. So, our agenda today, uh, we're gonna, we're gonna figure out why, uh, you know, we're gonna talk a little bit about why you wanna migrate. Uh, that's an important piece before you begin a migration is to know why you wanna migrate. Then we're gonna talk about migration planning itself. And when I say migration planning, you know, you might have a 5000 or 10,000 server on-premises, uh, estate, uh, with all kinds of complex network technologies, 600, 800 applications. You need a solid plan before you embark on migration. So how do you develop that plan with agent? We're gonna talk about that. Then Jonathan's gonna talk about AirBS Transform, which is our new agentic AI service to not only help you create, uh, uh, you know, plans, um, effective plans, but also help you migrate all the way end to end, uh, you know, from discovery all the way to rehosting. Um, uh, and then we're gonna talk about some best best practices for accelerating your migration. So finding out your why, before you even start your migration, it's important to know why it is that you want to migrate. Uh, if you're, if you're not absolutely sure about your motivation for migration, more, more than likely your migration is gonna fail. Not because something went wrong with migrations, but because you don't know where you, you wanna know where you are headed before you embark on the, on the, on the journey. Uh, so there's many reasons why you might want to migrate. Um, you know, as we've worked with customers over the last, you know, decade on migrations, you know, cost comes up a lot, you know, customers wanna, um, reduce the cost, operating cost of their workloads, and so they want to migrate to the cloud. That could be one reason. There might be some time, you know, temporal reasons as well, you know, you have a data center exit you want to execute within the next 6 months. There might be some licenses that are expiring in the next few months as well, that, that might uh create an urgency uh for you to migrate. Um, or you might just wanna be, have the capability to innovate a lot more, you know, having a legacy system on premises, uh, has its own tech deck and it prevents you from You know, innovating with the latest technologies such as Gen AI and so you might want to move to the cloud so you can innovate faster and quicker as well. So, there's many different reasons why you might want to want to migrate, and oftentimes it's not one reason or two reasons, it might be a bunch of reasons why. you want to migrate. So you wanna, you wanna be sure upfront, you know why you want to migrate, and you have the buy-in from your uh leadership as well as from your, uh, you know, colleagues within the company as to, you know, alignment on the reasons for why you want to migrate to uh to the cloud. Um And once you know why you want to migrate, it's important to also know, you know, most of the whys can be tied to some kind of a metric. So you want to be able to define metrics that can tell you how successful you are being at migration. Migrations can A long time. Priorities can change. It can take months, sometimes, you know, hopefully with agentic AI weeks, but even so, as the migration is proceeding, you want to make sure you have metrics that tell you whether or not you're on the right path or not, you're being successful or not. Um, so, so, so, so these metrics are gonna be important. There's many different types of metrics, you know, you cost savings again, as I mentioned, that might be, uh, that might be an important metric to track. So as you are developing a migration plan, you wanna, you might wanna weigh, you know, if I were to do this plan versus that plan, how would my cost change? If I were to use these easy to instances to to host my applications versus that, how would my cost change? Uh, you might wanna lower the time to market. Um, you have, you know. Say you have competition that's coming up with innovative services, you wanna move to the cloud quickly, so you have a uh a market mover advantage or whatever. Uh, so there might be timeline reasons why you wanna move and so you might wanna measure how much time to market you wanna lower as you move to the cloud, um, or you might you might wanna increase the amount of staff that is working on innovative things. And so once they move to the cloud, there are fewer staff members you need to focus on the infrastructure and, and. And the, um, you know, non-innovative stuff because the cloud can take care of that, uh, and so you might wanna increase the percent of uh uh of staff that is focusing on innovative, uh, innovation as well. Um, so there can be many different reasons, but it's important to have these metrics defined upfront. Um, and then, most importantly, does your leadership understand why you want to migrate as well. Um, most successful migrations, you know, you want to have strong buy-in from the leadership. This is an important move for a company. You're, you're, you're taking your on-premises work. load s over to the cloud. Almost everyone in the company is gonna be impacted for it by it. And so, you know, you want to make sure not only is your leadership, that you have the buy-in from the leadership, but you have the buy-in from all of your business units and colleagues as well. So, so with that, Uh, you know, that's sort of, these are the ingredients of a successful migration, uh, you know, leadership buy-in is the first precondition, but it alone won't make the migration successful, uh, you know, there are, there are constraints as well. So, uh, you know, if, if, if, um, migrations, uh, you know, you might have too few constraints, then they can, then the migration can fail as well. For example, um, you know, if you. If, if you don't have, if you're not time bounding your migration, then it can go on for a long time and, you know, Jonathan likes to remind me of Parkinson's rule, which is that if you increase the time, you know, uh, work comes in to fill up that time as well. So you will have people sort of, you know, doing busy work that's not contributing to your migration. So you wanna, you wanna make sure you're also, uh, uh, you know, you, you're aware of what the constraints are within which you wanna execute the migration. And then most important thing, once you have the why, once you have the metrics, and once you have the constraints uh with which you want to migrate, as we get into the agentic AI migration planning, these are sort of non-structured, sort of human understandable concepts that you want to then feed into the agent that Jonathan is just going to talk about. And the good news is that with generative AI and agentic AI these concepts of why you wanna migrate, what the metrics are you wanna target, and, you know, what your constraints are, they can be interpreted by the agent, agent that we're gonna talk about today and, and incorporated into the migration plans that proposes to you, and you can iterate on that plan as well. With that, I'm gonna hand it over to Jonathan. To talk about migration planning. Thank you. So as Tishhar just described, those are the preconditions for your plan to succeed, but ultimately you need a plan. The plan is fundamental for your migration to be successful. It sets the timeline, the outcomes, the goals that you are seeking, and helps your. Migration to stay on track. So what we're going to talk about firstly is the general principles of building a plan, and then we're going to go deeper into how you can accelerate building a plan with AI agents and specifically with AWS Transform for migrations. So, at a general high level, the basics of building a migration plan consist of roughly 4 high level steps. To begin with, you need ground truth. You need discovery data, ultimately. And what that means is uncovering information from your on-premises environment. So that includes a combination of both tech and non-technical data, which we'll get into a little bit more, but ultimately that serves as the information that feeds the rest of your migration plan. Now once you have an initial set of discovery data, it then becomes a case of assessments. Assessment can mean many things. We'll get into that a little bit more, but what typically an assessment means is TCO assessment, total cost of ownership assessment. Ultimately providing the financial basis for your migrations, working out. What the current state is on premises and what the cost will be on AWS and not just the pure cost, but the optimized cost. So how you ensure that you are managing your costs and realizing cost savings as part of the migration. That typically serves as the basis for the college financial model and one of the key metrics for success for the migration. And then once you have the basics of your assessment, it then becomes a case of wave planning, which will be a topic we'll get into a lot throughout this talk. Wave planning, put simply, is the process of taking everything that you have on prem that's in scope for migration, analyzing it, and then ordering it into discrete sets of of groups that can be moved independently and executed. It serves as the basis for your migration execution. Now, lastly, is agile planning, because ultimately, something that I really want to stress that will come up a few times in this talk, is that a migration is an agile project. You should treat your migration as you would any software engineering project and apply the same tenets and principles that you would to the majority of software projects. Think agilely and think about how to enact your wave as an agile project, and that involves setting up all of the the ceremonies, managing your road map, your backlog, you know, doing retrospectives, all of that good stuff, and thinking about how to employ the mechanisms that will keep your migration execution on track. Now critically. This is not a one and done process, that it's a cyclical process. When you start with discovery, that is uncovering some initial information. Often we see customers start with something like an RV tools file. So if you're not familiar, that's a basic export from a vSphere, VMware environment that contains basic inventory, uh, or it could be something like a, you know, simple CMDB code uh, change management, database export. And that provides enough information to get a basic assessment going, to do some basic planning. But typically, as your migration progresses, you know, maybe you start doing a few proof of concept, maybe move one or two simple POC waves, you start to need greater detail, to do more detailed planning, to get more detailed understanding, because realistically, non-trivial applications are, By the very definition, complicated. They have complex dependencies, complex communication patterns, complex RTO and RPO requirements, and to understand that, you need more data. So you're going back to discovery, getting more data, and then as you get more data, you've got more data to fuel your different assessment types with your TCO and other assessment types. You're fueling that information to your way planning, which that. plan then feeds into your agile plan. You update the stories that you're working from, you change your estimates, and so forth. So that at a high level is the general process. I'll go into that process in a little bit more detail, and then we'll talk about how you can use ADS transform to accelerate the execution of this process, because, you know, this process that we see here. Something that customers are doing currently in months and years if they're doing it manually. You know, very commonly we see this done as a manual program involving consultants, program managers, engineers executing this at scale. And what we want to investigate here is how can we make this go faster? How can we get the time to value for your migration as down as possible. Before we get onto that, let's go a bit deeper. So let's understand these steps a little bit more. So firstly, I've mentioned assessments, and I've dwelled a little bit on TCO assessments. That is typically the absolute essential assessment type, because without having a good understanding of your costs, there's a major risk to your migration. I would say, you know, after the first risk, which is the one that Thaw mentioned of not understanding your why, your reasons for migrating, after that, lack. Of cost management is probably the most common reason we see for a migration getting derailed. When we see costs exceed expectations, or simply costs are not managed and there is no base on expectation, that creates risk for the migration. So performing a assessment to understand those costs and then to track them throughout the migration is. Indispensable, it's an essential component of every migration. However, there are other assessment types as well that are important, and these typically vary by customer to customer, business to business. Many customers need some form of specialized assessment. So for example, we see typically large enterprises often have some sort of compliance need or some. Of security review. Typically these are assessments that are not entirely related to the TCO. They may have no cost component at all. Often these are done with an AWS partner or AWS professional services, and they help provide additional supplementary insight into your current disposition on premises and inform your migration strategy. And then lastly, the, the third common bucket of assessment type is what I call a people in process assessment, where you want to analyze your current organizational um strategy. You want to look at potentially things like your change management process, your finance, your, uh, operating models, analyze those factors and figure out how to transform them for better operating on the cloud and. You may need all of these, you may need a TCO assessment, but it depends on your particular challenges that you face on premises. Now, One thing that I do want to emphasize is the TCO assessment really essential for understanding costs. Being able to track those costs and reduce the costs are particularly important. So. That reduced cost angle, one of the things that really. Um, is important for that cost tracking. Is that workloads on premises typically are heavily overprovisioned. That what we observe most commonly is that on premises machines are provisioned often for peak. We see this most commonly in places that have any sort of seasonality in their workloads. Most significantly, you can see this in places. Like, uh, the retail sector where you provision infrastructure for peak utilization, you think about your Black Friday demand or your Christmas sales or what have you, and you're provisioning your infrastructure to meet those peak demands. Now if you were to simply migrate that infrastructure as is to AWS, what you'll typically find is that your costs are in excess of what. Be desirable. Instead, the best practice is to right size, as the term goes. And what right sizing involves is matching to the demand curve of your actual utilization. So if you are only needing, you know, 200 cores of CPU computes, you know, you size that to the appropriate number of, of virtual machines of AC2 instances of lambda functions, of what have you. And then if you have seasonality, you use the inherent elasticity of the cloud, things like auto scaling groups to manage that demand to meet the demand curve as it um undulates. And that is something that you can do manually, but is particularly challenging to do manually. Typically that involves a lot of manual analysis and spreadsheets and so forth. So being able to do assessments in an automated way is particularly valuable. We'll talk about exactly how to do that in just a moment. Now, once you've done the assessment, something that typically straddles the line between the assessment, the planning stage is dependency analysis. Now, this slide. Is moderately horrendous. Uh, it's very hard to make out what's going on there, and that is at some point, the, the point of this slide, that what this is, is a visualization of a TCP trace. It's a, a semi-real environment where we're looking at the communication of different machines within the environment. And it's very hard to make heads or tails of this, but understanding the communication patterns and the dependencies of everything in the environment is incredibly important, because ultimately what you don't want to do is to break apart some of that communication and then find that well my critical application, my mission critical system no longer works. So understanding these dependencies are essential, but trying to do this manually by hand is. A huge challenge. I've seen customers try to do this in spreadsheets through manual analysis, and it is possible, absolutely a graph analysis through all sorts of manual tools, but it is a huge time consuming slog and it's error prone. Me a dependency, risk. Wave failing to complete, you have to roll back. So this is a huge opportunity for generative AI to help us with. We can use LMs to solve this problem instead of doing it manually, but nevertheless, dependency analysis is a critical step which powers the way plan. So once you're doing your dependency analysis, what you're attempting to do is then. Identify applications within your environment. Now those applications might be predefined. You may have a good CMDB, you might have a good application inventory. That does happen, but very commonly what we'll see is that customers have had. Many generations of technology investment, some of their applications could be decades or more old, and being able to actually get a full handle on what's in the on-premises environment can be a challenge. Things like CMDBs or wiki pages or you know logs or what have you could be significantly out of date. So actually developing that application portfolio and getting a full handle on what's in the environment is a step that needs to be done. You can't just trust the data that's available. So first step is building that app portfolio, understanding these are my apps, and by apps, I don't inherently mean an application. It often is simply an app, but really what I'm meaning is a unit of business value, something that underpins a business function. Typically that's an app, but whatever it is, that is the, the unit of commonality that you care about in your environment. Once you've established that, which will call for an app for simplicity's sake. The question then becomes, what are the dependencies between those apps, and that's where your dependency analysis starts to feed into this. That what I want to know is that my application over here has a shared database with my application over there. I can't move these apps independently because they both have dependencies on stored procedures in this database. If I move them apart. Something will break, critical business functionality will go away. So I need to move those together. Well then, wait a minute, that database has a backup over there, it's got a replica over here, so I need to understand the full extent and the boundaries of my system such that I can understand what has to be moved together. And likewise, when I'm trying to resolve these dependencies, there's also the question of. What doesn't have to be moved together. So, for example, database dependencies, critical, however, Something like HTTP dependency, a web API, typically more latency tolerant, they don't have to be so tightly coupled as a database. Often you can split apart a web app, and that can go over a VPN or a direct connect between on-premises and AWS, so more tolerant. So understanding the limits of your application and uh those dependencies is the next important step. And then lastly, uh, is then taking your application groups, typically what we refer to as the dependency groups or move groups, and then ordering them into waves. So that is ultimately the wave planning process. Now to clarify quickly on terminology there, because I, I used some terms there. So applications. Units of business value, whatever you want to call them, ultimately those are the components that you care about. Those are the things you want to move from on-premises to AWS. You then have all of the communications between your apps that depend on each other, you know, that database dependency or those web app dependencies. That's what we call the move group or the dependency group. Um, I'll be using these terms in in the demos, they're useful to keep in mind. And then ultimately, lastly is the concept of a wave, and a wave is simply an a prioritized, ordered list of dependency groups or move groups. It is taking from my applications, going from my apps to my move groups, move groups to waves, put simply or more visually at least, this is what that looks like. So you start off with servers, I'll say for the sake of simplicity, but it could be servers, it could be networks, it could be storage arrays, the underlying physical infrastructure, virtual infrastructure that underpins your apps. It's then the case of identifying how this infrastructure underpins your. Apps and identifying what composes an individual application out of that set. Once you've then defined your apps, well, what apps have dependencies on one another, those shared databases and so forth. And then once you've got each of those move groups identified, you can see the colors correspond between move groups and waves. You then take those move groups. Push them together, so for example, you might want to move 10 move groups in one wave, or 1 move group in one wave. So you want to move into, as you gain confidence in your migration, start off with say, one move group of 10 servers for my first wave as I, you know, dip my toes in the water, and then as I advance and get to my nth wave, I might want to be going up to say 150 servers per wave, 10 move groups per wave, and getting larger and more ambitious. And this feeds into the uh plan for your migration. You end up with something that looks, you know, this is effectively visualized in. Um, per charts, gant chart kind of form, where what we have here is, uh, you know, overall set of weeks. You can imagine this is sprints effectively, and then you've got the tasks that correspond to each wave being executed in series. So you are thinking about how do I go from my infrastructure to the wave plan and then to an execution of that wave plan. And something worth thinking about, just giving some guidance here, is, you know, as you do that planning, you want to think about your why and the reasoning for your migration, but this is typically how you put together your way plan, if you're thinking about. How do I achieve my objectives? Think about my why, my reasoning. Generally I start off with something that shows initial value. I want to start off my migration plan by damaging value, because recall, the migration plan is not a one done, it's a perpetually moving and evolving plan. I want to start off my plan and execute some of it and show value to my leadership, to show that my migration plan is actually feasible and indeed works, and typically you start off with some small but yet meaningful applications. So you don't typically want to start off with purely, you know, dev tests or throwaway applications, because that doesn't necessarily prove anything. Anybody can move a server that doesn't have any users or an application that has no data. You want something that is small, but actually has meaningful business value to it. And ideally those are applications that have fewer dependencies, so if your dependency analysis did miss something, you're not going to break anything. Um, and ideally something that's maybe more latency tolerant or can tolerate, um, you know, some more downtime, so lower RTO and RPO higher RTO and RPO requirements. Then comes, as you gain confidence in your migration and start to prove its validity, you start to get into more higher complex apps, generally getting into the weightier parts of your application portfolio. Before then, as you really get moving in earnest, get onto those core mission critical apps, the things with the low RTO and RPO, the things that are more latency sensitive, more technical limitations. And then progress until indeed you have completed your migration, evolving your migration plan as you gain insight and learning from each subsequent wave. You always go back, change the waves as you learn. And that is key to know because ultimately, as I've said, and I'll hammer on this point, migrations should be treated as an agile project. Something that I've seen many customers do is get into the thinking that a migration should be a waterfall project, that I'm moving. On premise to AWBS that has a number of steps. I execute in serial, I'm going to execute a linear project plan, but absolutely that's a good way to run into challenges because you need to be able to evolve your plan as things change, as you gain new information. It's important to think of this as a cyclical agile process. And with that in mind, one of the biggest challenges that comes with migration planning being an agile project, is that this is how we got used to planning projects. Ultimately is through staring at spreadsheets and gan charts and Jura boards and so forth. And the headache here is that it's so much manual work to track this. You think about that slide with all of the network dependencies, tracking that by hand, breaking that down. Creating different tabs in a spreadsheet. I've literally seen, you know, 50 tab spreadsheets being used for large migration planning. And what's worse is that you end up emailing them around, so you end up with, you know, John's version 1, you know, Susan's version 2, etc. So version tracking and maintaining all of that becomes a huge headache. In the era of generative AI, we can absolutely do better to plan and execute large migrations. So that is where we get to. ADBS transform for migrations. So, uh, just as a quick show of hands, who is familiar with ADBS transform? Has, uh, folks had an opportunity to play with it, to explore? It's a relatively limited show of hands. Hopefully, uh, by the end of this talk, you'll all be familiar with ADBS transform and you'll be infused to go off and experiment with it because, um. You will have seen hopefully, a lot of the announcements that came yesterday, huge number of launches of ADBS Transform, our best in class generative AI capabilities for accelerating migration and modernization. So AWS Transform is a agentic AI service that encompasses a wide number of capabilities. So it includes migrations, which is going to be the thrust of what I'm going to be talking about, but it also includes full stack Windows modernization, so being able to transform Windows.NET and SQL Server applications, uh, mainframe modernization, so decomposing cobalt applications and moving it to Java, and then also launched. Yesterday is custom transformations, so the ability to do um almost arbitrary transformations, things like programming language upgrades and framework upgrades, um, using custom transformations in database transform. So I would highly encourage you to check out all of these suite of capabilities um that really help you both with the migration side of things, but then also once you're on AWBS to then modernize your environment. Um, but where I'm going to focus is really on the migration side, starting. With AWBS transform assessments. So AWBS transform assessments is a uh G AI capability for generating a TCO assessment. So has anybody ever done a migration evaluator assessment or an OLA assessment? Does that ring a bell with anybody? Any show of hands there? Perhaps not. Uh, so these are ways that ADBS has had for a number of years now, and they're capabilities that are human-led programs for building migration assessments, and they give a detailed assessment, but they're ultimately led by humans, um, and take typically a week or so to get a result. ABS transforms. uses agentic AI to automatically build an assessment, a TCO assessment. So what it does under the hood is generates code and programmatically does the assessment and then generates you an assessment output in a PowerPoint, PDF, and Excel format. So you can then take them to other tools, analyze them, and so forth. It's the fastest way in AWS to get a migration assessment, actually the fastest way pretty much anywhere to get a migration assessment. And it does currently uh any X86 compute, uh, attached storage, uh, object storage on premises to S3, and a SAN storage to uh uh EF uh sorry to uh FSX. Um, so, broad set of capabilities there, and we're expanding and adding more and more assessment capabilities there. So, we can have a quick demo of what this looks like. So this is the ADBS Transform console. OK this is, here we go. So what I'm doing here is I've created an assessment job, and it's asking me to upload data. So I'm gonna throw some data at it. In this case, I'm gonna throw an RV tools file. It takes a variety of different formats, but an RV tools file is a nice and simple format that everybody can get very early in the migration journey, typically. I'm saying what region I'm going to be in, and I'm gonna choose Oregon there, I'm gonna generate an assessment. So I'm gonna skip ahead a little bit in this recording, but it takes about 10 minutes, and what it's doing is generating um the assessment programmatically um under the hood. So we wait a few minutes for it to generate, and then I've skipped ahead here, I'm gonna click and then click review. So what this is showing here in the right hand pane is the assessment result, and this is it showed in the console, but this is it showing insights, you can see the compute, the storage, the annualized cost, the cost with a uh reserved instances, and it goes through all the assumptions that I've generated here. So it goes into the detail about how it was calculated. Now something that's kind of piqued my interest here is that it's using dedicated hosts. So I'm wondering why did it use dedicated hosts? That's not super common to use dedicated hosts. So I'm just gonna ask the chat, why did you recommend dedicated hosts? And what it's going to do then is it has a knowledge base built out of all the assessment data, the data that you provided it, and It will go through the math and then figure out, well, why did I recommend dedicated hosts. And what it's going to explain is that you had a set of Windows licenses that looked like you could optimize the costs using dedicated hosts, and then it did the math to bin pack those Windows virtual machines onto a dedicated host to get you the best cost effectiveness, and that's what it's explaining there. And you can ask it a number of different types of questions. So it's explaining the BYOL bring your own licensed math, that's there. And then once you've done that, you can look at the exports that it generates you. So this is the same data, exactly the same thing, just in PowerPoint format, so I'm just skipping through it very quickly here, but same numbers, maths, if you want to show that to your stakeholders or to your leadership, you've got a nice uh collateral generated there. That's just easy to take. Uh, you also have a number of other different formats, so the other one that's most useful is spreadsheet outputs, you can take all the math, you can throw it into other tools, visualize it, do whatever you want with it, so you can see all the, the raw assessment data. And then lastly is PDF. Now, the last step that it gives you is that you can then transition to migration execution. So what you just saw there that went by quite quickly, is that you're now in, it says welcome to ADS trials forum, I can help you migrate to EC2. What just happened there is it takes the data from the assessment and then populates it into a migration job. So then you can go into more detailed planning, uh, and do all the dependency analysis and migration planning that I'll show you next, but just nice feeds through to the next step. So what comes in the next step is ADBS Transform for migrations. So yesterday on Monday, we launched a huge series of new capabilities for ADBS Transform for migrations. So if you've ever used ADBS Transform previously, we've hugely overhauled, completely replaced the existing migrations experience to add brand new capabilities that we are very excited by. So this is what the ADS transform for migrations flow looks like. So it starts off, and potentially unsurprisingly, this correlates quite closely to what I've described earlier, indeed built that way, that you start off with discovery, taking the on-premises data, you go through migration planning, and as the focus of this talk is migration planning, I won't get super detailed into the later steps, but network migration, so you can take your on-premises uh networks and move them to ADBS and ultimately execute your migration. So this is a bit of more of a detailed explanation of what each steps does, um, of the ADSS transform for migrations capabilities. And something actually that's particularly novel that isn't going to be a focus of this session, but I'd encourage you to look into is the network migration piece that uh quite commonly, uh, you have to migrate a network from on-premises to AWBS. You're not building brand new networks, you're wanting to move your existing applications, your existing networks over. What we can do is to take a. Existing networks on premises via a VMware NSX through basic RV tools networking that includes vSwitch information through Fortun, Fortigate, Palo Alto, and through Cisco ACI. We can take exports in those formats, analyze them, and then generate VPCs, subnets, security groups, route tables, transit gateways, all of that. Infrastructure from the on-premises network. So rather than having to manually translate all of those networks, you get that done for you with agentic AI, which is super powerful. You can also edit those CDK, generate CDK cloud formation and terraform. You can edit those manually. You can pipe them into something like Que Developer or into Kiiro, for example, and further modify them. So Where we're going to go next is to look at those capabilities in ADS transform for migration and see how they can help accelerate your migration plan. So where we want to start off with is with discovery. So. That's some examples here of discovery data that you will typically want to use. The best practice here ultimately is to use a combination of different data sources. What you don't want to have is purely technical sources. You want a combination of technical and business sources, because ultimately you want to be able to understand the why, the meaning behind your environment. I might understand that these are servers, these servers will communicate on port 80 and port 443 and. Have you, but why do these servers exist? What function are they underpinning? What's the criticality? What should I reason about them as I go through my plan? And that sort of business context, the sort of business logic that informs why they exist, is important to take in, and we can take that through formats like CMDB data or meeting notes or wiki page dumps, anything that gives that kind of context, we can adjust. So what that looks like is that you have, as you can see on this bottom left here, an upload pane with an ADS transform where you can throw data into, and it's literally that simple, as I'll show you in just a second. You take your data, throw it in there, in a wide variety of formats, and we will slurp up that data. Now, one thing that I want to highlight as well is that often getting technical data can be something of a challenge. You know, getting things like process data, inventory data, networking data may rely on third party tools or having to use a combination of different tools. We've made that simple by creating the ADBS Transform Discovery tool. So this is a. Uh, network-based collection tools, it's installed as a virtual machine into your on-premises environment and then collects using a variety of protocols like SNMP, SSH, um, WinRM data from your environment and maintains it centrally, and then outputs a file that you can upload to ADS Transform. Critically, Uh, that file is independent of any network traffic, so you can run it in a completely isolated network environment. No route or communication is necessary back to AWBS, so it can run in isolated environments. So let's look at the Discovery tool very quickly. So this is uh the discovery tool, this is running on premises in a local environment, and this is its local web UI. It's very simple UI um and what it shows here is the data that I'm giving it, so I'm giving it a different set of SNMP credentials and SSH credentials that it's using to pull from the environment. This is just a test lab that it's running in. But what it's doing is pulling from this environment 1000 servers or so. Um, you can see there, it only collects database data from Windows SQL Server right now, so it's not supported there, uh, but you can see the majority of servers it's pulling network connections from, it's got a few errors that I need to resolve, but it reports that information and then gives you an inventory file that you can then download and then throw into database transform. So, you know what I've just done, literally the process of setting up this by deploying a VM. And then downloading the file, takes about an hour end to end to get basic information, and here I've got, you know, spreadsheet filled with rich network data, process data, uh, process to process, so I understand for example that I've got Curl running on this server, communicating. Over HTTP to this server and HTTPD is running there, so I get this rich network trace to inform my dependency analysis, and this is available without charge, as indeed all of the ADS Transform migration experience is and it is a very powerful tool for getting data in. Now, once I have data either from the ADS transform discovery tool or from alternative sources, it then becomes the case of getting into ADS transform. So what I'm looking at here is the beginning of an ADS transform job. Now this is a migration job, and what I'm going to do for the purpose of this session is simply do migration and planning, and discovery and planning. I can do an end to end job or just network migration, a whole host of different permutations, and you can add and remove job steps at any time. Now what I'm going to do here is that I am going to throw in a whole bunch of information here. So it's saying these are my two steps I want to do, import of entry, and then build migration plan. So, I'm saying looks good, it's going to create the job plan, you can see it on the left-hand side, it's created there. And what it's now going to move forward into is awaiting user input, so it's awaiting my data. Takes a second or so, and now I say you can upload data using this file upload. I'm going to click that file upload. I'm getting a little ahead of myself, go on, go click, and then there is the upload dialog box, and what I'm doing is just taking all of these files that I've got sitting on my desktop. And uploading them, and we'll get into what those files are in a second, but those files are just a whole random spattering of files. Some of those files are you can see CMDB export in there, discovery tool export, it's a whole mixed bag. So we'll jump onto that in just a second, but I just told it to looks good, go forward with it, and what's going to happen is that a combination of traditional parsers and then uh AI agents are going to analyze all this data. So you can see we've got some data from the Discovery tool here, an RV tools file. That is an arbitrary CMDB style data mapping apps to cost centers and users. This is a file that's a Zoom meeting recording, that's got a whole bunch of people just chatting about what their migration is and what they're going to do, completely unstructured. This is an export from a wiki that I put into markdown format, um, and I'm just throwing it up there and asking the LMs, the underlying agents, to then analyze this data. And make sense of it all. I don't have to mix formats and manage spreadsheets. I just ask the AI agents to figure it out, and that's what they do. And you can see once I've uploaded a quick summary, I've got 1300 servers or so from this import. Um, this is my work on my operating system. This is my app catalog that's figured out. These are my common network ports, I can see a lot of SSH collection, uh connections, I can see Mongo DB in there, HTTP, I can identify some apps, and it. It gives me a view of all of my applications. So from those meeting notes, it's figured out, you know, here's a bunch of apps that are in focus, uh, from the uh ADS transform Discovery tool, it's got all the network connections and process data, and there's my raw server list that I can get, and I can export this all if I want. But, you know, literally built up very quickly, a pretty detailed view of my environment from just arbitrary files um that are pretty easy to get. So once I've got that. I can then start the planning process, and again, I can come back to this at any time. But let's move on to the next step, which is planning, and you can see now, I've moved on a little bit, I've added some additional data, and I've skipped to building migration plan. And what I'm doing here is trying to build up my app catalog, you know, understand what apps exist in this environment. So what I'm doing here um is looking at my inventory as it exists right now, and it's giving me, similar to what we just saw, but a little bit more details of adding more servers to it. And I've noticed something, for example, that I uploaded a bunch of data that had a whole bunch of powered up servers because the data was messy data. Now, the agent didn't want to just remove those servers. Servers, because that could actually be important to me. But what I'm going to say is, why I want to get rid of some of this data is showing me, here's some questions you should think about. For example, should I get rid of powered off servers? Should I normalize the data? And what I'm saying is, those powered up servers, that's just messy data. Let's get rid of that. So it's going to clean up that data for me, and then it says, well, I've gone down from 5000 servers to around 1200 servers, filtered it all down, um, and cleaned up your environment for you. And you can do any arbitrary data processing that you want here. You can do, say, I want to remove servers based on a host name pattern, or I want to remove servers based upon being in this data center or being on this subnet. I want to add more servers. Here's a list of the servers I want to add, or here's another file I want to add to them. And you can see here it's saying, I want to go to app grouping now is my recommended next step now that your data's a little bit cleaner. But before I go into app grouping, I'm gonna ask you some questions. So one question I'm asking is, for example, describe my network architecture, and it's saying here's some notable things. I can see LDAP. is common in your environment. Everything is speaking to the LDAP server. You've got one single LDAP server, you might want to make that more fault tolerant, ADS directory services would be a good match for that. You've got 4 primary database types in your environment. Notably you've got a single SQL server in the environment, a little bit odd. And you can see that this is your network topology at a high level. You've got some key subnets in there. It's generating some initial insights to what things your waves could look like, and it's asking questions about how uh you want to go about and do application grouping. Now. I saw that LDAP server getting mentioned, so I'm going to say, you know, what is that primary LDAP server? You mentioned everything has a single point of failure, so it says, well, here is your LDAP server. It's LDAP primary test lab, it's my test lab server, and it gives me information about its role. Role in the environment and I can ask pretty much any arbitrary question as long as I have the data for it. I can ask questions about it. So if you have a software catalog saying you know this is my SAP environment or you've got um inventory about what is running on each web servers at a web app level, you can ask me questions about any of this. So, after I've done that kind of data curation, then it goes on to app grouping. So, what I need to do is ultimately get my servers into apps. So what it's saying here at the start of this is that I can notice you've got a common set of host name patterns. That you've got common uh dev, test, prod names in here. I can see from your meeting notes and your calls that you're talking about different environments. So it's asking some information to figure out that. And I'm gonna paste a whole bunch of things in there that is answering these questions. So I'm. Say for example, that I have two primary facilities, one in Vancouver, one in Seattle, and they have different host name patterns. This is how I identify each app, and this is how I identify if it's dev, prod, test, etc. from its host name convention. And I'm also asking it to consider a network traffic. So I'm asking it, for example, group anything together with tight coupling like database dependencies, but then separate anything out that has, you know, a more latency tolerant leads GDP dependencies. And I'm saying, don't split app to you. You might want to have your database and web to you separate, I don't, it's one app to me. It asks some clarifying questions, so I'm trying to execute what you're working on. I noticed some things like, for example, some servers have hosting patterns you're describing some uppercase or lowercase. So I mean you just ignore that. I don't care about it. But I could say actually it means something semantically significant, so I can inform that. Um, it's asking about unknown prefixes. Should I create new apps for prefixes that don't correspond with anything you're talking about in your meeting notes. So the wiki page. The meeting notes that I gave mention certain apps, and it's correlated the host names to those apps, but there's some that don't match. So what I'm going to say is to just create a new app for it. And I'm saying other things like if it's an app server and a web server, just treat it as an app server. In my world, app and web means the same thing. So I'm just giving it some additional context, and it's figuring out all the intricacies of my environment. So it's a purely chat-based experience. And what it's saying here is that I've done my app grouping, I've ended up with 486, uh, it's a nice number, uh, apps, I can break that down more. It's ident for quite a few single server apps because they don't have network traffic, so you look single server, but I can break that down further with more information. And it's asking how to prioritize those apps. So do I want to assign a priority to different apps? Are all apps equally prioritized? Probably not. So what I'm saying is that I want to prioritize environments. So for example, I want to move my dev and UAT environments before my prod environment, because I want to make sure that those environments work correctly. First, um, I'm saying that I I have some things like the actual data collectors that gather the data in that, uh, data set to just remove those because they're noise, and you can change the scope at any given time. Um, and I'm just answering some of the other questions I'm asking. It's us asking about complexity and so forth. So I'm giving it those answers, and what it does then is, uh, basically produces a final app list, and it's saying app structure and complete. Here's my list of apps. It's happily named most of them, because it's got the names from all the um meeting notes that I submitted, um, and it's figured out some other names that we don't have good data for, like test cluster, it's kind of made up the names, but you can say, actually that test cluster is called this, and it'll appropriately rename them. And then it's building out an incremental kind of plan that it still needs more information to refine, but it's, it's getting closer to a final plan. What ask next is move groups, so that is, as you recall from earlier, move grouping is that dependency analysis phase where we group all the apps together. And this is, I'm just gonna go through this one quite uh quickly. What this is doing, you can see regenerated, I skipped ahead a little bit, but I basically told it, group everything together on network dependencies and do that analysis for me, and it's done an initial grouping. But one of the things I've noticed is that it's saying, and one of the things that I gave it in a bit of an earlier conversation was some information about my teams and my capacity for delivering my plan, and I'm noticing, mm, wait a minute, some of these numbers. Don't look great to me. You know, you've got weeks 1 to 6, you got weeks 7 to 8, and you're saying there's certain timelines implied here. I don't love that because I'm on a timeline. One of my constraints is timeline constraints. So I'm asking to, uh, how do I change my move groups to move faster, and it will go forth and do that analysis and figure out, well, actually, given your timeline constraints, I could change some of my move groups, balancing risk and speed, and make some changes. So for example, Saying combine dev, UET, alpha and beta, because they're all functionally reasonably similar in terms of their behavior. Group that together, and make the groups larger, paralyze them out, and then you could actually meet your migration target within the timelines. So it's coming up with ways to accelerate your migration plan, changing its strategy dynamically on the fly, and you can ask it about any constraints that you want to employ on your migration here to to meet those constraints. And I was asking some other things here that um we'll skip through a little bit, but you know, I was asking you, tell me more about your timelines, your risk tolerance, um, things that you want to focus on. Um, and I'm saying, you know, ultimately I want to focus on the 6 weeks. I want to balance, uh, risk tolerance, and it, it goes forth and figures that out. But, um, yeah, it regenerates that in the interest of time, I'm gonna skip forward on that one. Once it's generated the final move group, so analyzed all those dependencies and come up with a plan. What it then generates is the wave analysis, the wave plan. So that is ultimately taking those move groups and then prioritizing them into an ordered, prioritized set of waves. So what it's going to ask for here is information on the business prioritization, the business logic in here. Now it's been able to glean a lot of this from the information that I gave it. The more information you can submit, the more it understands, the less it has to ask. So I'm giving it some general information here, um, you know, I, I, I wanna start with minimally complex apps. I want to save my products to the very end. LDAP needs to move first because we knew LDAP's a critical dependency, and it comes up with a general high level plan, uh, for ordering these waves. It says these are my phases to move each waves in. Here is the servers within each wave, here's the move groups within each wave, and it breaks it all down for me. Um, what you can see at the bottom there, if it wants to scroll down, um, is you can see some of the key metrics. So it's achieving the six weeks, um, it's saying these are the resources that I use, I told her about the people I have to execute my migration, it's talking about the max service per wave, uh, the time savings and so forth, and I can ask it for arbitrary breakdowns of the grouping, I can change its priorities, um, I can do anything that I, I want really to change my plan. Um, and then ultimately, uh, what I can do is, um, finalize this plan to the execution and go forth to my network migration and to my rehost. But at any time during my execution, I can come back to this plan. I can say, well, actually, you know, wave 18 didn't work out so well. It turns out I missed a key dependency. I want to go back there. Or my leadership is saying go faster, uh, so I actually need to come up with a different paralyzation strate. or I need to find other ways to accelerate. So it's an iterative process. You can at any point go forth and um refine the plan. And lastly I'm asking, you know, give me some backlog that I could populate my um sprints with my my backlog with, and it generates some ideas as to here's the task that you need to do to be able to actually execute this. So you can then basically take your uh wave plan and there's the final step of planning, populating the. Uh, agile plan out and then begin to set up all of that mechanism and process to then start delivering your migration. Alright, so we've got a few minutes left. That has been a bit of a whirlwind tour, but that is the discovery and the planning experience within AWBS Transform. So that is effectively going from high level, um, rough data in many different formats. Through to analyzing my environment, doing the dependence analysis, applying business logic to prioritize, and then producing an executable, ordered wave plan, and then generating ultimately a set of very high level stories that I could then start to use. Inform my agile plan. This typically is something that we see customers execute in months. Um, it's a long term process. This is something that you can now move to literally building it in, you know, minutes, hours, uh. But in a real-time scenario, this is something you always come back to and we're always refining, but still something that you're doing orders of magnitude faster than what you would be doing if you were doing this by spreadsheets and manual analysis. So we think this is really changing how migration planning will be done in the future. All right. And now over to you for the conclusion. Thanks. Yeah, so, uh, you saw the, uh, the advantages of using generative AI and, and, and an AI agent. This is when I knew a couple of weeks back that we really built something very, very, that's going to be really useful to customers. What John One of them showed you is he was asking a lot of different questions to this agent. None of those are questions that we've programmed the system for at all. It's figuring it out on its own. So this is when I knew a couple of months back when a customer was using this, uh, you know, on a trial basis, this wave planner, and they randomly asked, you know, hey, uh, group, all my, and they had like hundreds of applications, Group, uh, uh, create a wave so that all my security related applications move together. You know, not something we've programmed for, but, but when, when that question was asked in front of the customer, it figured out which applications related to security, figured out which servers had dependencies on those applications, and generated a wave group that was appropriate for that particular request from the customer. So that's the advantage here is that you, when you use it. transform and this wave planning agent Jonathan just talked about, you don't have to wait for us to add new features that meet your use case. Now it's intelligent enough to listen to your use case, take your own data, and figure out how to solve it on the fly instead of waiting for the service team to launch new features with it. That's the advantage of generative AI here. Um. Best practices for migration planning. We've covered it all. I'll, I'll, uh, I'll recap it one more time. Again, automate with agentic AI. Don't try to manually plan. You know, spreadsheets are dead. You don't need them anymore. We've got artifacts stored within AWS Transform. The the the agents as it works on your data, it will generate assets if you want those assets, you can download them and take them with you, but you don't have to be the one working with those assets and spreadsheets and CSVs. The agent will do it for you. Uh, iterate migration is never a one shot deal. Uh, it should not be large migrations, complex migrations take time. So because now an agent is, by the way, going back to that customer about security groups, their response was, hey, you know, what you just showed me live here on the meeting would have taken me weeks, if not, you know, you know, a couple of weeks to, to get done manually, and you just. Kind of ask the question and get it done. That's the advantage of iterating here is that because now with an AI agent and generative AI you can do so many things so fast, it can think on your behalf really fast. You can iterate quickly as well. You don't have to worry about trying to get everything right the first time along. You can go along, come back, restart, you know, uh, and reset and and and iterate over and over until you see something that that you like. Uh, understand the technical and business dependencies combined as me. You don't have to worry about, hey, you know, I'm using this software. It only takes data in this format or that format. Jonathan showed you he was dumping all kinds of meeting notes and you name it, all kinds of data into, into the, uh, the agent, and it was able to extract information out of it and use that information to generate your migration plan. So, so for the first time. You don't have to be feel bound by the kinds of files this tool accepts. Just throw everything you've got at it and see what happens. Not saying it'll get everything right in the first time, but then that's where it iteration comes to your rescue as well. Uh, and, and lastly, you know, gradually increment, start with low risk waves, you know, move, uh, move small numbers of servers, and as you gain confidence, increase the wave size and increase your confidence. We only talked about discovery assessments and migration planning today, but AWS transform, once you have the plan, you can go ahead and generate networks, you can move your servers, you can execute the entire migration end to end. We just, this session simply focused on the migration plan. So you should, uh, once you go back from here, consider using it for a small, you know, uh, data set, uh, doing an end to end migration. So to conclude, uh, you know, uh, you can now with, with this kind of agentic AI, uh, I would say 4X is even underselling it a little bit, but you know you can migrate large enterprise workloads at least 4 times faster, um, with agentic AI. Uh, you don't need to use spreadsheets anymore. You don't need to use any kind of files. Let, let just use natural language to interact and. And the agent will create the files for you. Take the undifferentiated heavy lifting out of your migrations and de-risk by doing by automating dependency analysis and wave planning. Don't, there's no need to do it manually. Anything that you do with this agent, you can ask it to generate a detailed report if you need to take a report for auditing. Purposes internally to your IT department or your leadership uh or legal, you can, uh, the agent will give you a detailed report of the plan or if you choose to execute what it did with the network migration or the server migration, you can take those reports, print them out, and, and use that for auditing, but you don't have to be the one to be doing all this manually. And with that, we'll open it up for questions.
