Well, welcome everybody. Uh, we are so excited that today we have the opportunity to share with all of you how Cochlear is enhancing their contact center observability with Amazon Connect. I am Hannah Bloing and I'm a senior manager of solutions architecture for Amazon Connect, which is part of our applied AI solutions portfolio. And in just a few minutes I am going to be welcoming Andy McLaughlin on stage with me. He is a senior contact center leader for Cochlear, and he is going to be sharing a little bit about Cochlear's journey with customer experience transformation and how they're accelerating that transformation using AI and it's, it's truly one of the most innovative medical device companies in the world, so really exciting story that we have for you today. So just a little bit about me, um, so I've been with AWS now for a little over 5 years and I've been with Amazon Connect for that time. Um, I've spent about 20 years, my entire career in the contact center world and after 2 decades in this space I can truly say that we are in a very special moment right now. For really the first time ever we have all the tools, we have AI at our fingertips and all the automation where we can really solve problems in ways that truly weren't possible before. So, while we're here to talk about the future of customer experience and AI, I want to maybe point out something that's something that everybody here has in common. Does anybody have any guesses what that is? Customer service, yes. OK, actually it's that we're all human. Um, so humans love a little friendly competition. So, um, before we dive in, I don't know if you've actually had a chance to just kind of process that we're all here in Vegas together for the week. You're meeting all these amazing professionals from all different industries, all different sizes. We're learning from each other, but it can't be ignored that we're actually all sitting in a casino. I don't know if you all noticed that, um, so if you haven't had time to hit it yet, I haven't. We're just gonna start off with a little game, so don't worry. Um, I promise I will explain the rules to you first with a very easy one, but then I promise we'll catch on, so get your arms, uh, ready. This is gonna be interactive. So just a practice round, how many cups of coffee have you had today? So you can shout at me, you can hold up your fingers with 12 or 304? OK, 2. OK, so, uh, good practice round. I've had 3. Yeah. So you're all pros at the game now. Alright, so how many Americans do you think work in a call center today? Is it 1 for 1 million or 2 for 3 million? You all are good at this. Alright, so the answer is 3 million, and so that's a very, very big number. So in addition to delivering great customer experiences, we have to do this really efficiently because with numbers like this, millions of contact centers in the world or contact center professionals in the world, efficiency is really what improves customer outcomes and it's really what accelerates very big outcomes. So just by way of a quick data point there, Dish Networks is one of our customers, and they're using Amazon Connect and they improved agent efficiency by 25%. So I did a little bit of napkin math at 15,000 agents. That's like instantly adding almost 4000 employees. So if you're wondering how does a contact center at this scale do this, well, I think you're in for a treat because we're gonna talk a lot about it today, and it's one of the reasons that I'm really excited to just start to dive in and talk about Amazon Connect and AI. OK, next one. You guys are so good at this though. I don't know how long do agents spend on after call work per call, 5 to 10 seconds or 15 to 30 seconds? OK, 2, you all did it again. All right, the correct answer is 15 to 30 seconds. So in a contact center handling 1 million calls per year, saving 15 seconds per call is 4000 agent hours saved annually. So every second where your agents aren't spent helping customers is significant when you think about that scale. But more importantly, um, handling these contacts efficiently is really what drives better customer outcomes. So for example, Saks, they deliver high value service that they provide as part of a luxury brand and using Amazon Connect they were able to leverage generative AI. Automatically convert 20 minute customer calls into brief summaries and reduce that after call work by 15 seconds, so this is where they're seeing those real outcomes where human agents are now empowered to elevate and personalize the experience their customers expect as part of a luxury experience. One more. Why do nearly half of contact center leaders say they want most from their quality management programs, a new scoring mechanism, or more time for analyzing and calibrating? OK, 2, OK, yes, alright, so 46.4% of leaders say that they want more time for analyzing and calibrating, so they don't wanna spend time, uh, drowning in spreadsheets and doing call listening that's manual and really leaving less time for deriving actual insights. So now that you see how Amazon Connect customers like Trager are using Amazon Connect to use insights that Amazon Connect provides to uncover trends, they can optimize their support operations and ultimately deliver better outcomes for their customers, which is really evident from a Trager's CFAT increase, um, as you can see there. So alright, thanks for playing along everyone. I think everyone now is ready for the casino. So, um, let's connect the dots from some things that we learned in this pop quiz. So first we saw how massive the opportunity is for innovating in customer experience and contact centers because 3 million Americans are working in call centers today and that scale means every small gain matters. Second, we learned that even 15 seconds per call translates into thousands of hours saved for agents, and that's real efficiency that changes how work can get done. And then third, we saw that leaders don't just want more data. I think all of you probably have a lot of data. Is anybody like short on data here? Yeah, no, I think we all have lots of it. Um, they want more insights and they wanna spend time improving the customer experience, not drowning in spreadsheets and other manual activities. So this is really where Amazon Connect comes in. Amazon Connect combines AI automation and observability to tackle these really massive challenges head on, so our customers can really transform their services into something that drives growth and loyalty, and you're going to hear a lot about that in just a few minutes from Andy. And so Amazon Connect is truly reimagining the contact center in this AI era that we're all uh in this journey on together with Amazon Connect, businesses finally have a single platform that reduces operational complexity while delivering that intelligent, efficient experience that customers and agents and contact center leaders expect, and it's all backed by the innovation and the scalability of AWS. Across all industries we talk to customers every single day and we look forward to talking to you, uh, after the session. We're really seeing 4 big themes that we're anchoring all of our innovations in. So one, AI that takes action, which means that we're giving our customers agentic capabilities that are smart enough to think and analyze and act autonomously. So this unlocks huge opportunity when you think about how you can transform your self-service customer experiences. Second, we're thinking about how you elevate your workforce with AI. So this is really our opportunity as contact center leaders to embrace this time where we can transform our agents into trusted advisers, and this is really where um you can also think about how AI can work as a teammate to seamlessly hand off self-service interactions to agents when needed. Third, we think about how we transform that data that we all, you know, we know we have lots of, and how do we turn that into, um, relationships. So this is where we're using customer data to drive personalization and driving advocacy advocacy for long-term customer relationships. Again, gonna hear a great story about that in just a few minutes. And then finally it's really about accelerating outcomes by delivering a level of operational agility and control at scale where we can deliver customer experiences that allow you to manage quality at scale and insights that truly previously you could only derive by doing manual call listening and doing something at a fraction, a very small fraction of what you could do before. But I think I wouldn't be uh being truthfully honest here if I was gonna say that this isn't coming at the cost of lots of challenges and in customer experience challenges that we are are taking upon ourselves is amplified because of the scale and complexity that we're all dealing with. So first and foremost we wanna you know talk about how we action with AI, but many customers that we're talking to still rely on manual analysis and disconnected systems. So there's data silos and truthfully there's just a lot of data hygiene issues, so they can act on insights quickly or they can't act on insights quickly and that and that limits how much AI can actually automate. Second, of course leaders want to empower their agents, but teams are already stretched very thin, and automation, of course, which we've all adopted different degrees of automation that helps, but AI has to be embedded into existing workflows to really gain the adoption and that feedback loop that's critical for success. So 3rd, personalization that requires visibility of the customer across all channels and we talked to many customers today which still don't have that visibility across the entire customer experience set across all those channels. And then finally we all are sitting here, we probably all are listening to a lot of sessions and great innovations about AI today. The um the potential is really clear, but adoption and integration into production workflows is really, really challenging and without observability and insights and governance, scaling production workflows is going to be really, really hard and maybe impossible. So if we go back to those same four innovation themes, this is really where Amazon Connect comes in. So first we have built-in AI and automation, and that allows Amazon Connect to bring those autonomous, intelligent interactions directly into customer interactions. So whether that's powering self-service experiences that are dynamic and they're lifelike or performing and automating tasks that historically required one or multiple humans to complete, this is really a key part of Amazon Connect's Foundation as an agentic solution. And it's really the first place where you see AI and humans truly working together, where agents can autonomously bring a human into the loop when needed. Second, Amazon Connect provides real-time agent assist capabilities where we can really start to think about how we can transform how agents work, and this is where agents can provide human agents with real-time insights, whether that's insights about the customer, company knowledge, processes, recommended actions, step by step guidance, that's all personalized based on what the customer objective is. Third, this all comes to life when you take that customer context and you leverage that to build relationships with your customer, and not only through those personalized interactions, but guiding them through the right products and services that may delight them based on exactly who they are as a customer. And then finally Amazon Connect gives leaders visibility with built-in insights, and they we have things like real-time insights and historical dashboards, and we provide the governance and AI powered quality management tools and this enables you to not only do all these things but drive continuous improvements as a proactive business versus a kind of a reactive customer service operation and that's where you can start to see those performance and identity patterns and take action all from one place. And and truly this is how Amazon Connect bridges the gap for our customers where they have these aspirations they want to do all of these different types of things and new use cases, and this is how we allow our customers to execute with real results like some of the ones that you saw earlier and it's because Amazon Connect embeds AI and agenttic capabilities into every single layer of the contact center. So our approach has earned the trust of tens of thousands of businesses that rely on Connect to handle over 10 million daily customer interactions, and this is the same platform that supports Amazon's 100,000 customer service associates in. Over 30 countries and this scale isn't just about numbers, it really represents every single logo up here represents real businesses solving real business outcomes and this is really where we start to see how companies are trusting Amazon Connect to handle their most critical customer interactions. So we're gonna hear from a very special customer, um, and this is really a story that truly brings all of this to life, a company that's not just delivering great customer experiences, they're really changing people's lives. So I'm gonna introduce Andy to talk about how Amazon Connect is empowering Cochlear to have all the foundational elements they need to innovate fast and start to build. In agentic experiences into their work flows we'll talk about how they're transforming their business using built-in observability and real insights that they can take action on and this is my favorite 1. 3rd but certainly not least, they're building a customer experience that matches that product innovation that again is really truly changing people's lives. So with that I am going to hand it over to Andy. Thank you. Thank you very much, Hannah, and uh it's a pleasure to be here. Thank you very much uh to everyone at the AWS Connect team for allowing me to come and talk to you guys about what Cochlear are doing uh with all the innovative features with Amazon Connect. Um, so, my name's Andy McLaughlin. Uh, I run the network and the voice team. I am, uh, more traditionally a network person, so the contact center is quite a new field for me. Um, but, you know, my background, I guess there's a lot of similarities with, with networks and the contact center. I mean, in the 90s, I was doing BGP on ATM links for MCI. Uh, these days we're running VPCs, TGWs on AWS with IAC. And uh About 20 years ago, got into voice. We started using DSPs, SPCs in the early 2000s. Uh, so I do love my three-letter acronyms or TLAs, and, uh, I think there's a lot of those in the contact center world as well. So it's quite an easy transition to make with things like FCR, uh, CSATs, and all the other acronyms such as WFM that I'll talk about in a little bit as well. So I've been at Cochlear now for 4 and a bit years. Uh, and when I first joined, uh, we had, uh, a bunch of disparate contact centers, uh, all around the world, and it was, um, my, one of my first big projects was to get off those, uh, contact centers and have a real standardized setup. Um, Customer experience is critical for how we operate. Um, interestingly, being a company that deals with the, the hearing impaired, the voice channel is our most popular channel and the, the way that most of our customers get through to us, and also how we deal with a lot of our B2B type, uh, work as well. So let me tell you our journey, um, how we've empowered the business with Amazon Connect, and we're transforming with agent observability, and you can't leave any, Any session these days without the mention of the word AI so I'll cover a little bit of that as well. So who are cochlear? Uh, we are the world leader in, or a world leader in, uh, implantable hearing solutions. So these are not hearing aids. It's actually, uh, an implant, uh, that is, um, surgically, um, inserted, uh, just on above your ear. And it has a, a wire that goes in directly into the, the the cochlear. Um, and then on the outside, you have a sound processor. That enables people to hear. The latest innovation we've just done, in fact, is we have now just released back in June the first upgradable implant. Not only that, it has memory on the implant as well, so we're, we're very much innovating in our space. We're the only organization that currently does that with, with hearing implants. Um, so what, so what do they do? They bypass the damaged components of the ear and go directly into stimulating the auditory nerve, and we have 22 electrodes that are in that go into your cochlear that provide that the, the electrical signal that goes directly into the brain stem. So what do they do? They provide a lifetime of hearing outcomes. So a, a child could be born with profound hearing loss, or, uh, there's uh many other reasons, uh, in, in younger age where you might, uh, find that, that, that you've lost, uh, so for instance, um, I believe meningitis has been a, a cause as well where you have profound hearing loss. Uh, so, where one of the, the great things about what we can do is we can implant children, um, I think as, as young as 1 or 2 years of age. And they have much better outcomes with our implants because it takes a little while to adjust to them and obviously if you've had it for all your known life, it's it's quite easy to adapt. But it's very important they do provide a lifetime of hearing outcomes, so it's very important that we continue to innovate at Cochlear. To improve the quality of our products, and this is why we, we love to partner with AWS. So the technology was invented by an Australian scientist, uh, hence my accent. I'm from Australia as well. Uh, and the, the guy that invented it is, uh, Professor Graham Clark. Uh, his father had bad hearing loss, so, um, he was a quite a genius. He was on a beach one day with a blade of grass, and he put that into the shell and thought, hey, that is like how the, the cochlear looks, uh, and how can I use, That idea to To inspire um. Will basically provide uh better hearing outcomes for people who have profound hearing loss and none of none of the functions of the middle ear uh work. So what's our global footprint? Um, as mentioned, we, we were the first multi-channel cochlear implant. We, we can provide, uh, implants to, to people in over 180 countries. We have to date, uh, used, implanted 700,000 people with our, our products and improved their, their hearing and, and life. Um, and we have to, to do this, we have to invest very heavily in R&D. So $3 billion Australian dollars to date has been invested. That's about $2 billion US dollars. And we continue to invest around 12% of our uh of our revenue in R&D. So partnering with AWS, as mentioned, it allows us to continue to innovate. Um, all of our customer facing apps, uh, enterprise services, and of course our contact center runs on Amazon services or AWS services. And I mentioned Graham Clark before. So one of the things that we've just released about a month or two ago is our own internal AI world garden. And we've done that by using AWS Bedrock and Agent Core. And we have named that Clark. So a nice name, uh, to give some, uh, you know, some really great things that, that Professor Graham Clark did for us. So let me share our journey on Amazon Connect, cause that's what we're here to, uh, to hear about and how we've managed to empower our business, transform observability, and we continue to innovate with AI. So why Amazon Connect? Um, we needed a standardized global contact center. We have, uh, contact center operations in 14 countries. Uh, so it was at the time, uh, we had multiple disparate systems. We had SAS services, on-prem systems, managed services, depending on which country you're in. Uh, the US has the biggest contact center, um, and, uh, yeah, that was a very challenging sort of managed semi-on-prem. We had the PSTN services on-prem, the SPCs on-prem. Uh, but we had a data center and it was a managed service. So we had, uh, critical networking infrastructure that we needed to, to make that work, and we had lots of issues with that. Um, so increased reliability was something that we were really after that, um, you can obviously find in Amazon's cloud services. Because what's most important for us is that if a customer can't reach us, they may not be able to go about their lives, uh, so they might need a, a, a part or something as soon as they can get to us by calling our device support teams, and they can get those, um, any replacement parts or anything they need, um, expediently. And the other thing is that, uh, with issues with your contact center, your agents aren't performing as well as they should. They're, they're trying to change soft phones to go to a backup call manager type system, and yeah, it's just not a, a great way uh to be running. You need, you need reliability in a contact center, obviously. The other thing we needed is to have a lot of flexibility. Uh, so we have many diverse call flows, we have multilingual, we've got 14 different languages. Um, as I mentioned, we have. B2B services, uh, business to customer services such as device support, orders and insurance, a pro-care team which is for clinical support, uh, and, and sales. Uh, we also wanted something that could provide a lot better visibility for us. Uh, so we, at the time, we were doing, uh, or, or even in the, when we first moved to Amazon Connect, uh, we were only able to evaluate the calls in which, you know, the supervisor would be able to listen to 3 calls for an agent per month, randomly selected, uh, and our quality team would listen to another 2. So our agents were only getting around 5, what we called scorecards, um, per month done. Uh, finally, the, uh, last thing is the innovation piece. I mean, obviously the way and the pace at which Amazon innovates is something that, uh, is, is a great alignment with how Cochlear works and how we continue to innovate with our products as well. So how do we do it? um. We use a lot of extra Amazon services, uh, as well as Amazon Connect. So, uh, one of the first things that, I mean, we had 180 different queues in our US system. We managed to reduce those down to 40 queues. And we did that by using, uh, lambda functions, talking to a Dynamo database. And that enabled us to have things like, you know, depending on the language or the time of day, you didn't have to write whole new cues. You would just go and interrogate the database depending on the option that was pressed or the time of day it was, and that would then subsequently change what the IVR was doing. Um, Amazon Poly, for those who don't know what Poly is, it is a text, text to speech service. Uh, so Poly can work in all the different languages in which we operate. Uh, interestingly, it's very phonetic in certain language. Uh, my partner is from Finland. That is a very phonetically spoken language, so exactly what you wrote in, in poly, it would come out perfectly. Now, in America, Uh, the way that we, I pronounce Cochlear or in Australia we do, um, it's pronounced cochlear in, uh, over here. So we had to actually write the word Coke as in Coca-Cola, and then L E A R in order to, to pronounce, in order for the poly to pronounce cochlear, the way that it's spoken, uh, in, in this part of the world. Um, as mentioned, 14 different languages, uh, so it was perfect for our global operations. Right, so next up, call recording. We had call recording before, um, but we didn't have transcription and we certainly didn't have sentiment analysis. Um, transcription really is a game changer for automation. Um, I'll come to that in a bit, but you really can't do a lot unless you've got accurate transcriptions. Another part with transcriptions as well is that if you've got somebody who's called up, they've shared their credit card details, the agent hasn't paused that recording, uh, we might find that we've recorded somebody's credit card number, which is bad for PCI. So we have a, a check that goes on where transcription reduction enables any credit card numbers, for instance, to be automatically removed from both the call recording and the transcription. So that's just a, a standard feature that comes with Amazon Connect. Um, which was very helpful to, as a sort of backstop in case our agents failed to, uh, pause, pause and resume the recording for PCI information. Um, lastly, Salesforce, we use that as our CRM, uh, so we, uh, we're able to integrate that, so the dialer is now within the Salesforce CRM. Uh, and, well, not only that, we have screen pops, so depending on the customer's calling number, we're able to pop up immediately, uh, that customer's details, so it allows our agents to get to our customers' information a lot more quickly. So how do we do it? Uh, it took about 6 months. There's a lot of BA work as you can imagine. We, uh, we're reworking a lot of the IVRs and queues and try to, um, like for like, uh, in a lot of it, but a lot of it we're trying to also optimize, uh, as I mentioned with the, the lambda functions and Dynamo DB. Um, so we, as I mentioned, 14 countries, 5 different AWS regions. Now the reason for that is because Global organization like us, um, and the way that telecommunications companies work, uh, you can't, you, you can't, you need to be exist, your tenancy needs to be existing where those phone numbers come in. So for instance, in Asia, uh, because of, uh, I, I, I don't know any of you guys who've operated in Asia with, uh, telecommunications and voice, um, but it's a very challenging place to do it because there's so much regulatory activity, it's very hard to port numbers out of carriers there. So that took probably the most amount of time was, was the, was the preparation of work with BA's and, and the, and the time taken to port numbers into AWS. But we got there in 6 months, and uh the result of that is, A a significant improvement in uh stability and availability. In fact, that number there is not a lie. We have in our US contact center in US West too, we have had 100% stability. It is exactly 2 years and 6 months since we went live. It was the 1st of June 2023, and we have not suffered a, a single outage during our operating hours between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. and a little bit on Saturdays, uh, so Monday to Friday, 66 to 6, and then, uh, Saturday mornings as well. So no more telco outages, uh, which has been great, and uh also it's been very good for our, our agents to have a much more reliable system and integrated into Salesforce as well. The other, uh, good outcome from this obviously was cost. So we actually saved from paying the managed service provider, the previous, uh, per user per month charges, the telco costs, we actually cut that in half by moving to Amazon Connect. So what next? Uh, so a couple of years later, which, uh, during this year, we've, um, Spent a lot of time enhancing our services. When we rolled out, we had a workforce management product that was not the Amazon products. We had quality management that was also another product. Uh, we had a lot of our BI tools, our dashboards using a, a, a third product as well. So we were sending a lot of our data, PI data to multiple systems which, which, um, our privacy team wasn't that keen on. Uh, so we made the move in June this year to go to Amazon's unlimited AI. Now, moving to Amazon's unlimited AI has opened up some really good things for us. Um, first of all, um, not the unlimited AI side, but we, we do a lot of customized reporting. So one of the great things that Amazon Connect provides is they have a data lake of pretty much everything that goes on, all the CTR information or everything that goes on with any call. And we have a, for instance, a custom post-call survey. Uh, that provides 33 variable results that are done at the end of the call. Um, so that type of information is not available in the regular historic reports, but the great thing is you can use Athena glue, put it into Quicksight or Quick Suite, and you then have, uh, information that may not be available in historical reports. Uh, so we moved away from it that BI tool, uh, we now do everything with Quicksight or QuickS Suite, sorry, I'm still adjusting to the change in name. Um, and yeah, that's how we're able to build custom reports, um, and I'll dig into that a little bit more a bit later as well. Um, one thing as well is that we didn't have omni-channel. We still don't have a proper omni-channel. We have email and chat going through our CRM, uh, but all of our voice calls are through, uh, Amazon. Um, I wish they well. All were coming through Amazon as a routing engine, but, uh, I don't have as much sway with the CRM team as I'd like to. Um, but one of the things that we needed to do, uh, as part of our observability and scorecarding. Was to do evaluations for email and chat, and luckily Amazon have released tasks, and you can write auto accepted tasks that then you can utilize them for chat and email if you don't have omni-channel if they're still using a different system. Um, I guess the key point here is that when we moved to this, uh, the new automated quality evaluations, and we moved to the, uh, native FCS tool, I'll go into these in a bit more detail. Um, but it was about 6 to 8 weeks training to get our, uh, the, the, the people who look after the quality team and the, the scheduling team, uh, to, to get up to speed and understand how to change everything, cause it's quite a different looking system to the traditional. The traditional WFM type and quality type scorecarding systems. Um, what this has enabled us to do is we can now automate scorecards across all of our interactions, and we get much more accurate forecasting, uh, because of all the machine learning that goes on. So What are some of the, let me dig into some of the, the really key features and how we've improved things. So if you're gonna be doing automated scorecardings, one of the most critical things is to have accurate, uh, transcriptions. So, uh, Amazon Connect has a thing called custom vocabulary, vocabulary, um, and that is something that has significantly enhanced, uh, a lot of our brand terminology. So for instance, we had a, a, one of our products is called Osso OSIA. Um, and the amount of times that both agents or customers said Aussia, um, it, it had about 5% accuracy. It was coming into everything. It even said Aussie at some stage, which I thought was wonderful, but it wasn't accurate, uh, an accurate transcription. Uh, so we used, we got all, we went through a bunch of the, the transcriptions and we found where this was being said in or, or transcribed incorrectly, and we were able to simply. Um, add all of these keywords in that were incorrect, and now we have 95% accuracy from 5% just by making those changes of a list of words that would sound like this Austeo product. Um, the other thing that having, uh, accurate transcription is searchable business data across all calls. Uh, as you know, uh, agents don't necessarily input everything into a CRM that's said on the call. Um, you probably don't want everything that is said on the call, but you can search all of these transcriptions. Um, you can use rules and all sorts of things to, to find out if you're Um, having issues with, um, a certain product and, and finding trends, um, or seeing if a campaign is going well, so there's some really good use cases for, uh, having that accurate transcription. Oh, here we are. So, so the other thing down the bottom here. So enhanced reporting, I touched on this a little bit. So this was using the, the data lake, historical reports, and now what we're able to do is glue together a whole bunch of fragmented, uh, statistics that are in different areas. So obviously your workforce management or your FCS as it's called on Amazon, those, uh, statistics are stored in one section. You might have. Uh, information such as our custom post call survey that we're pulling out of the data lake, and then other things that are straight out of historical data like, you know, a, the, the average handle time and things like that. You can then build customized scorecards with, with QuickS Suite. Uh, you can have them so that teams can have like a team type dashboard or individual agents can have dashboards as well. So there's a lot of customization that we've done to really bring, bring all the specific information that we need to have, uh, in one pane of glass for our supervisors and executive teams. And last but not least, um, the real-time dashboards, uh, we were able to Very quickly provide a dashboard of uh you know which agents are logged on at the time, what the wait times were, um, it's quite simple to do, we, we could push that out to a TV screen and we even had it so it could work on a mobile phone app. So as mentioned in June, we turned on uh unlimited AI. And the first thing I'll talk about here is the, the key to this, uh, to this session which is all about observability. So automated evaluations, this is something that was a real game changer for us. Uh, as mentioned before, we're only scoring 5 agents per month. Uh, right now, I looked at what happened in, uh, October when I was, uh, pulling this together, and we'd gone from about 1000, um, evaluations per month to 22,000 now in October. Uh, we're not running this across all teams, we're still trying a bunch of different use cases for it. Um, but it really has been a game changer, and I can't stress enough that, the, the reason why we can do that is because of the transcription accuracy. Um, the good thing about, uh, moving to unlimited AI is you can have an unlimited amount of scorecards, um, or evaluation forms, as they're called. Uh, the other thing as well is that on a single call, you can have multiple evaluation forms. So there's many different types of evaluation questions you can have. There's the traditional manual ones, so that's just you pick a call and it's a bunch of uh standard type questions that you would have when you're evaluating an agent, uh, or that call. Uh, and it's all manually inputted by, by the, uh, quality team. Um, the second way is where the automation kicks in. So there's two parts of automation. One of them is what's called the category-based automation, uh, which uses the rules, and then the newer way of doing things which is G A G AI, and I'll, uh, cover a little bit of the difference between the two of those. So this is a rule-based, uh, setup. So as you can see here, um, we're looking at on the left-hand side there, um, we've selected words and phrases and an exact match. Uh, you go in, you create the rule, uh, and on the right-hand side, you have a word list or a list of phrases or words. Uh, so these are out of the box stuff, you can create your own ones. Um, there is one that we created for profanities. I thought that probably was a bit rude to put up, but, um, you, you can use that to determine. Uh, Anything that's going on with your, your agents, um, uh, uh, depending on your industry as well, you can put specific stuff that's relevant to the calls that are going on in your industry. So this is the more traditional automated approach. Um, you've got to really know what you're looking for. Um, it's very deterministic, so, um, as I mentioned, you can have a semantic match, um, or an exact match. These are really good for compliance checks, um, if you've got specific regulatory regulatory compliance requirements and explicit policy violations because of the exact nature of the text that that is being searched for there. And then here's the cool stuff, the Gen AI questions. So if you see down the bottom here, this is a, this is a, an evaluation form. It's got a bunch of questions on it. Um, and down the bottom right there, left one was the first one that I talked about that's not highlighted, that's just the manual form where you have to go in and actually do it yourself. Uh, the, the second option there is the, the categories and rules that I just mentioned. And the third option of what we've used here is Gen AI. So these are just real natural language questions you can put in. So did the agent show empathy, for example, or were profanities used? Um, they adapt to context, uh, they provide a much more subjective, uh, or interpretive scores and explanations than categories do, um, as it uses AI generated reasoning, uh, for how it scores. It can be a strict yes or no, but you can also have expectations. So did it meet expectations somewhat, uh, not at all, and so on. Um, and it does provide an AI, uh, reasoning and some words to behind why it's, it's come up with, uh, that particular score as well. So these are great for quality assessments and soft skill evaluations. Now remember, if you've got unlimited AI you can just play with this stuff, you can run as many as you want. It's, uh, takes a little bit of prompt engineering to get the Gen AI questions to work the way you want. Uh, and we're still, uh, even after 4 or 5 months playing with different ideas and different ways that we can use Gen AI here to, uh, put the questions in to, to help, uh, to help our agents. And that's really the, the benefit of all this is that. You can now, because you can score all of the, every agents, all their calls, all their calls, you can now target the actual issues, the actual problems where there's a common question that might not be being, uh, answered correctly by an agent or so on, but you can target those by, by looking at the reporting, uh, and then use that to have much more targeted training for your agents as well. So it's a, it's a very good thing, um, to have so much more automation and, and be able to score so much more. So this is the output that you see, um, once you go into conversational analytics, uh, it's now called all those that know contact lens, it's, uh, this is, this is that same thing. So at the top left there you have, uh, all the details of the call, who the agent was, how long the call was, uh, and then you have evaluation scores on the right-hand side there, and, uh, also sentiment analysis. And if you scroll down, that's where you can see the full call recording and even below that you have the full transcript. Um, what is also happening here is, uh, you can have a full AI summary of the call as well. So with transcripts, you don't really want to be putting that into a CRM. Uh, you can have the full AI summary, uh, as part of this as well generated, and it puts what could be a 30-minute conversation into two paragraphs and succinctly provides, uh, a good, a good piece of information that you can put back into the CRM. So we're looking at that at the moment, um, and that seems to be working quite well. Um, so, um, and just to touch a little bit on the, the right-hand side there, as you can see, they're all weighted scores. I think 14.3, I think that must have been seven or eight, calls there, and they're all weighted exactly the same, and they're all yes or no answers. So that's why they're all coming in at that exact 14.3%, I think it says there. Uh, so what's next? This is doing it for human agents. Uh, I believe Hannah will be talking about the fact that you'll be able to do this with your self-service agents down the track. So what's next? Continue on with my three letter acronyms, um, FCS. So this is forecasting, Capacity Planning and scheduling. Um, I will call it FCS because it is a bit of a mouthful. Uh, but the, the wonder of, uh, the Amazon way of doing this is that it uses excellent machine learning, uh, for your workforce management. So out of the box, I'd, I'd recommend one of the first things you do is change it to 15 minute intervals in the scheduling. Uh, this allows for, uh, a little bit more accurate forecasting. Um, but it adds a little bit more flexibility to your schedules as well with 15 minutes, and that increases agent happiness. And so we all like happier agents and where they can actually have a bit more, uh, ability to have, you know, a 15 minute break at 15 minute intervals rather than half an hour. And this is reported that it can improve service levels by 10% as well. Now we had 2 years of uh historic data when we went into this, so we didn't have to import anything. But if you're gonna go live with Amazon Connect and you don't have any historical data on Amazon Connect, you need about 6 months of data or 6 months or more, and around 2000 contacts per month, and that's enough for the machine learning to start building your, uh, capacity planning and, and forecasting. So this is what forecasting looks like. This is a real example. Um, so over, over time, um, we have had a very big uptick in our, uh, call volumes because of the new, uh, the new implants that we had released a few months ago. Um, so this is showing on the left side there, the, the fore the forecast over time of the amount of, uh, amount of calls we're, we're expecting. And then to the right of that you've got your contact volume, so there's the, the forecast amount in the red and the actual amount in the green. So you can see it's pretty accurate around how it is forecasting throughout a day, uh, how many agents are needed or how many calls are needed and how well that matched the the forecast that was provided. Right, so after that capacity planning, so the C and FCS, um, this is obviously all about making sure you've got the right amount of agents, FTEs that are available. Uh, so as you can see here, I put the box to highlight where it's, uh, Thanksgiving and the December break. And as you can see, there's a significant drop in the number of FTEs needed because that's usually a quiet period. And that's learned that from the last two years of historic data that we had in the system. And lastly on the, on, on FCS is scheduling. So this is an example of scheduling. Um, I was in UTC time here, but this is supposed to be from 6 a.m. Uh, so this shows you where you can see the, the staggered brakes. Um, this allows, uh, you to have automated schedule adjustments, simplified brake management. Um, and agent schedule adherence, which is obviously a key metric, uh, to track adherence to schedules. Um, also, all of this obviously enables you to make data-driven decisions. So contact center managers need to make data centered decisions to boost agent productivity and reduce customer wait times. So now the last thing I wanna talk to you about is the future innovation and the, the new things that we're doing and we're trying at Cochlear. Uh, so what we've been doing is testing a lot of our use cases internally. Um, and the first thing that we, we started playing with was an interactive IVR, so using a self-service, um, the, the AI agent, uh, to answer calls. Um, we plugged in a bunch of KB articles, just threw them into an S3 bucket, um, pointed, uh, Amazon Connect at that S3 bucket for, for its knowledge base. Um, and we, we had to play with this in our IT help desk. So you could call in, you could ask questions, um, bring the, the voice team. We were, we had a bunch of questions about headsets and how they would work, and you were quite, quite simply able to get a pretty decent response. Um, you could do this with chat. Um, then if you weren't happy with the chat, you could say, I'd like to speak to an agent. That would escalate you to a real agent, and we had all of this working, um, in a, in a pilot that we ran for our help desk, uh, a month or two ago. Um, we do have some challenges with our ITSM tool. Um, uh, my service delivery person isn't here, so, um, but, but, but that's why we haven't, uh, implemented that fully, but it is something that we've, we've had a lot of, um, uh, uh, a lot of time to, to really get to understand how the AI agents work. Now the second really cool thing we did with uh this was integrating it with Lex. So Lex is a, is a conversational tool that allows you to have uh what are called slots, which are the basic type of questions or guardrails around what you can ask. Um, we then linked that to lambda functions, uh, that could talk to our AI world garden. Uh, so, uh, the, the bedrock walled garden that we have. Um, and, and the really cool thing we did here was for our sales road warriors. So imagine you're out there, you've seen a, a prospect, uh, you've come out of that meeting, and you need to update that, that lead in Salesforce. Uh, so what, what we, what we're doing is you call into a number, it recognizes who the, the person, the salesperson is that's called in. Um, they can put a pin in to, to a bit of added security. And they sit there and they talk about the customer they were, they were dealing with, um, that links it to, to the the cause, uh, obviously Salesforce knows they were seeing that customer, so it's quite easy to link that to, to the right case. Um, they put a description of the meeting in and they talk about the next call objectives. We then throw all that using lambda functions to Bedrock. Bedrock then, uh, ties all that, it packages that whole conversation up into all of the right fields that you can then input straight into the CRM. And your salesperson would be very happy that they don't have to go and log into Salesforce to do this, and they can do this straight after the meeting while it's all top of top of mind. So this is something we're just playing with at the moment, and we're hoping to roll this out to our sales teams later in the year. Um, so I, I, I will stress that it's very important I think everyone that talks about AI will say the same. Test this kind of stuff in your internal teams first, uh, before you, you unleash it into your, uh, public contact centers or customer facing contact centers. Uh, next, next thing I'd love to do is, um, enable Omnichannel, as mentioned. Um, I've a bit hard for me to bring in the, the chat and the email from the, the CRM guys. Um, but the benefits that would bring would be, would be twofold. First of all, all of the automated evaluations, we would now be able to do those, not just with voice, but with all the email and the chat. And we could have scorecards that are specific to a chat or to an email conversation that's going on. Rather than using the tasks which is what we're using now. Um, I mentioned as well as before the, the AI summary that comes, uh, with the, uh, at the end of each call, when you turn that on, um, we're, we're now using APIs to write that straight back in. So if there is a case that's created for the call, um, we, we know what the case ID is in Salesforce, um, as part of the CTI integration, so we're able to write back a full call summary. Right, so, um, What are the lessons that we learned? Um, leverage the power of Amazon services. There's so much flexibility there. I think I've mentioned all these, so Lambda, Bedrock, Quick Suite, Dynamo DB, Lex, API gateways, S3 buckets, uh, they're all critical for us to build the flexibility and, and allow us to. You know, have all of this integration with our own data, so you know it's our AI world garden, it's our knowledge bases that it's querying, so all these tools and in particular Lambda is a real key because it is basically the best way to to use a microservice to link all of these things together. Um, I mentioned transcription accuracy a few times. As I mentioned, that's critical to harness uh the automation and AI. You've got industry terminology, company names, abbreviations, or different pronunciations. Uh, it's very important that you have accurate transcriptions for all of this automation that I talked about. Now automated evaluations, um, they're amazing. I, I can't speak highly about how much we've managed to see now where we weren't able to see before the amount of calls to be able to target issues and then provide that targeted agent trainings on all calls. And um as mentioned, when to use the different types, so we had the rules categories, the compliance checks, specific regulatory requirements or policy violations, and generative AI is much better for soft skills evaluations, uh, holistic performance reviews, and, uh, quality assessments and things like that. Um, scheduling and forecasting, I said, 15 minutes. Um, select that at the start. I think you only have one chance to do that when you first turn it on. Uh, so make sure you do that. You'll have happier agents. Um, and as mentioned, if implementing at the same time you're implementing Connect, make sure you've got some, uh, historical data of your, you know, 6 months and at least 2000 contacts per month. Um, the fourth thing there is historical reports and the data lake. Uh, there's so much data there, that it's, it's ridiculous. You think there's a lot when you look at, uh, just the historical reports alone, uh, but the data lake has got everything that you could possibly want that goes on, on the calls. Um, and this has enabled us to have our evaluations with schedule adherence, post-call surveys, uh, and all the other regular type contact center, uh, statistics all on customized dash dashboards for our supervisors and agents. And lastly, experiment, innovate. We've got a sandbox. Allow your engineers to play with that. Um, with Gen AI you've just gotta keep trying different things until you get the right outcome. Um, and lastly, thank you very much. This is my last slide. Um, I thank you very much for having me. It's been excellent to come here and talk about, uh, everything that, that we've done on Amazon Connect. And I think Hannah has some wonderful updates about some of the stuff and the great new features that have been released. So thank you, Hannah. Mm. A. So I, I love this story so much because we talk a lot about how we're going to transform customer experiences and relationships and you know the Cochlear story really highlights like what could be more transformative than thinking about customers' lifelong experiences with a brand like from babies to the age of one. 100 and then the second thing that really stands out to me about the story that they shared is really that just the um experiences that they're creating for customers' experience, the reason that their customers can actually engage with these contact center experiences is because of the, the innovative medical device solutions that they provide. So I just think that's such a phenomenal story. Um, so we have launched a lot of really exciting features, um, at this reinvent, and I'm gonna highlight just a couple, um, as we go through the rest of the session. So Amazon Connect now integrates Nova Sonic's AI speech model which delivers a more natural and expressive conversational AI interaction. So it's a model that understands not only. Customers say, but also how they say it and kind of mirror their energy and that really enables that dynamic responses that adapt to customer tone and style. Um, additionally, some other things that are really critical as you're thinking about designing these agentic experiences, they can autonomously complete customer interactions. Not only can they adapt to voice responses, they can also escalate to human agents as needed. Second, Connect now brings data-driven quality management to AI interactions with automated performance analysis, and this is a capability that helps organizations understand AI effectiveness at scale with granular insights into the customer satisfaction, resolutions rates, and interaction quality. So here's just a quick overview of what that looks like, but in this short little demonstration you can see how we're automatically evaluating AI agent understanding and performance, reviewing the insights alongside recording and transcripts, and this is something that is also available with Amazon Connect unlimited AI pricing. Next, um, a lot of customers that we work with are using Salesforce. Um, Salesforce contact center with Amazon Connect now supports real-time AI agent assistance and contact summarization. This functionality leverages customer information and knowledge-based articles from Salesforce CRM, and it provides unified views of customer data with Salesforce service and sales cloud. Quick little demonstration of what that looks like, but in this short little video you can see how we're using real-time voice transcripts and recommendations. We're enhancing call monitoring in Salesforce and also allowing for automated post contact case updates. Amazon Connect, um, great story by uh Cochlear and Andy about uh their um their implementation of forecasting capacity planning and scheduling. We now offer a multi-skill scheduling capability which improves how contact centers can really utilize their specialized talent by intelligently matching agents with multiple skills to forecasted demand patterns, and this enhancement allows organizations to strategically deploy valuable multi-skilled agents such as, uh, for example, bilingual staff during their peak periods while maximizing their utility during those off-peak times with general, general inquiries. So a quick little demonstration of this, um, this really shows how we can help to reduce staffing gaps in specialized cues through intelligence scheduling of cross-trained agents, and it also enables a dynamic workforce optimization across multiple service dimensions simultaneously. And then the last one that I'll talk about is now in preview. Amazon Connect now allows for AI powered predictive insights that transform customer understanding through 5 recommendation algorithms. So this is where the system analyzes customer behavior patterns and their interaction history to really provide those tailored suggestions during both self-service and agent interactions. So a quick little demonstration of this. But this is just a quick little example that's actually Pasquale DeMayo. He's our VP of Connect. Um, he's a customer in this example, but in this example you're showing from the agent perspective, um, we're recommending, um, similar and recommended items to him, um, frequently paired items for cross selling and popular trending items. In this example, he's a big K-pop fan. Um, if you see him walking around, he's wearing a Connectrix K-pop shirt, so, um, you'll, you'll see what I mean when you run into him. Um, but that's really what we have for you today. We have a ton of great content lined up for you, uh, at Reinvent. Please, you know, try to, try to come and see all these new sessions, and if you, uh, would like to talk to any of us directly, a lot of us are gonna be hanging out in the village booth at, um, 8:13. And so not only can. You can talk to um different experts and learn about these capabilities in depth we'd love to learn about your use cases and talk to you about, you know, where you are in your contact center journey and if you'd like to explore any of these capabilities that we talked about today in any detail, um, anybody at our booth can give you an in depth demonstration as well. So thank you so much, we really enjoyed our session with you all. Hope you have a great reinvent. Thank you.
