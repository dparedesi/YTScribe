OK, I'm gonna kickstart. Yep, I think we're good to go. A very good evening, everyone. A very good evening and a warm welcome to each one of you who has taken the time to attend our session today. Um, I know you had a lot of sessions to choose from, so I'm really grateful you've taken the time to come here and attend our session, and we promise you a very fun-filled and and a very learning experience in the next one hour. Um, before I begin, I wanna make sure all of you have your headsets on and also you can hear me. If you can hear me, can you please raise your hands? OK, perfect, awesome, awesome. So with that being said, I do want to share that whether you're a CX leader or a business owner who's looking for your next big strategic transformation or an IT architect who's working on the next cool solution and is trying to build that. Or whether you're an innovator who's just curious to learn about AI and how we can apply that in customer experience. I believe you all have the same question on your mind. How do we truly apply personalization and customer experience and we scale that to 10s and thousands of customers. Today in this session, I am gonna walk you through along with Jack, how AI powered Amazon Connect can help you achieve exactly that. Quick introduction. My name is Aisha Burker. I'm a principal solution architect specializing in Amazon Connect, and with me I have Jack. I'm Jack Hayden. I'm a principal product manager of Amazon Connect specializing in genic AI. And in the next 1 hour we will be walking you through these main 5 themes across personalization. The first is why is personalization even important? We will also touch upon how Amazon Connect helps you achieve personalization for your end customer use cases. And then we will also touch upon real customer results, customers who have delivered personalized experiences in production and the business outcomes that they've achieved today. I promise you, and I'm very confident that at the end of this session you will have learned a lot and you will see a lot of the cool tools that Amazon Connect has launched recently that you can use and go back and implement into your contact center too. With that being said, I actually want to start with a story. A story of personalization gone horribly wrong. So there's a very famous movie quote that life is like a box of chocolates and you never know what you're going to get. So this is from a time during my last birthday when I was received a box of chocolates as my birthday gift and I wasn't expecting that at all. The reason being, last year was also the year I jumped on the bandwagon of being fit and joining a gym as well. More importantly, I was also extremely vocal about it. I made sure everyone around me knew that I'm, I'm trying to be fit. I'm lifting kettlebells, I'm eating my salads, every social gathering that I went to was all about my fitness journey. And yet when my birthday arrived, a very dear close friend of mine decided to gift me a box of chocolates. I guess by now you know what went wrong. I kept giving my friend all the information she needed to know about my life, and yet the decision she made to gift me had nothing to do with any of the information or data that I provided to her. A quick show of hands, any one of you have been in a similar space, received a gift you are not? Well, how does that make you feel invisible, right? Ironically, a lot of organizations and businesses today are making the same mistake. Your customers are constantly giving you a lot of information about themselves. They're going to your website. They're clicking on certain items, they're accessing your web app. They're calling you in your contact center. They're telling you what their problem is, and yet organizations and businesses are not trying to use that data and deliver a personalized experience. I want to share some interesting statistics here. So McKinsey did a survey and they said that 76% of consumers are more likely to consider purchasing from brands that personalize. Again, how many of you agree? How many of you would go and shop if a business actually knew you and would have a higher propensity to check out? Perfect. I agree with you as well. The other data that I have is that organizations that implement personalization are realizing 10 to 15% lift in revenue. The good news is that personalization lives in Amazon's DNA. Amazon has 25 years of learning and innovating just on personalization. So in 1998 we launched our first recommendation engine that simply said customers who bought X item in your cart also tend to buy by. That was a simple AIML model, but over the years we've learned, we've churned and we've improved this model to deliver even more sophisticated and unique experiences, not only across channels but also across devices and machine learning. And the good news is we are now bringing similar learning models and infrastructure to you so that you can deliver the same kind of experiences for your users using Amazon Connect. I just want to give you one example of personalization. Anyone here who has explored help me decide. OK, we have one person, but help me decide is a product recommendation feature that Amazon has launched recently in the app. So if you're trying to buy something and you don't know which one should you buy, I'm always in that position. I'm always someone who can never make a decision, but help me decide will basically tell you, let me load how it works. You, let's say you're searching for tea kettles and then it starts finding the best option for you personalized based on your usage, your product history, and your recommendations, and it gives you three options, right? The upgrade pick, the best of recently viewed, and also the budget pick. So help me decide actually makes it really easy. It removes the mental load off your end consumers and what's the right decision for them and what they should shop and what they should end up buying. So I know all of this sounds amazing, right? Personalization is critical, it's important, but why is there a still a gap? Why are most organizations still struggling to deliver personalization? I think the problem is broadly in two categories. The first is data. I spoke to you about that, right? Your consumers are giving you a lot of data. How do you unify that data? That's the fundamental problem. However, the emerging problem that we're seeing is I have the data, what do I do with it? How do I know what's the right recommendation? How do I know I, how do I pair the right product with this recommendation and how do I deliver that experience to my customer? So these are the twofold problems that we are looking to solve. With Amazon Connect. How many of you here have heard of Amazon Connect? OK, most of you have, but for anyone who hasn't, Amazon Connect is basically our cloud-based contact center, which is one application that provides you one seamless experience across all channels with routing, analytics, inbound, outbound agent and supervisor experience. Within Amazon Connect. We are now launching Agentic AI that enables personalized customer experiences. So tying back to the two problems that I called out earlier, the first is unification of customer data. How do you make sure your customer data that comes from different channels, including your contact center, your websites, is unified in a singular customer profile. OK, now what do I do with that data? So this is the GEI insights which we will be focusing a lot more on today. The first thing is having a specialized AI sales agent. This is something you can build, and I'll also be showing you a demo of, uh, later today. The second is segmentation. How can I provide GEI insights on the data and the unified profiles I already have? And then obviously you want to measure the outcomes and you want to analyze the kind of information and the insights you're delivering in your customer experiences so that you can come back and improve upon it. And then lastly it's the customer engagement layer. Once you have the profile, the GEI insights, how do you deliver that either in customer service, proactive outbound engagement, your web app, or your mobile apps. So I just want to go back to the AIML models that I was talking about which Amazon.com has been using for years and now we are launching 5 similar algorithms for you out of the box and connect that you can build within an AI agent and deliver in a customer experience. So the first model is recommended for you. Recommended for you is a one on one personalization. This model tends to know your customer on a one on one basis. What does Jack like? What do I really recommend to Jack? So that's, that's the crux of that model. The second is similar items. This model will help you deliver the perfect alternative. What if your customer's here to buy a new t-shirt and you're out of the t-shirt? How do I provide them a perfect alternative, a similar item, so that they, they feel like, yeah, this seems like something I would buy too and then go ahead and make that purchase. The other is, uh, frequently paired, which is your classic upsell and cross sell algorithm. So if a customer has a high propensity for shopping, uh, let's say pet food items, they probably are also shopping for pet, um, dirt bags, right? So something of that sort you can frequently pair the items and you can provide it to your customers. And then trending now is your classic algorithm for what's trending, what's hot now, what is every customer buying, and how do you deliver that to your end user. And the last one is popular items, which is what are your popular items in general? What are your consumers buying from you and how do you provide that to your end users using this algorithm, either through the medium of the AI agent or directly in your websites. And then finally, what's the real outcome, right? I have these algorithms. What are the outcomes that I'm going to achieve? Increase in revenue, increase in customer lifetime value, and then decrease in abandonment, right, where your customers are coming in, they don't see what they like, it's a hard time to figure out what they even want to purchase from you, and then they just abandon your cards and then they leave you. That was a lot of talk. Let's see some of this in action. So I'm gonna show you a quick demo of an agentic powered personalized interaction using all of these AI features that I just spoke of. So we're gonna start with our first persona, Priya. She's a revenue growth manager at any company retail. And her challenge is that they're now entering the summer season, they've launched a summer collection, and she needs to do an outbound campaign that's personalized and reaching to the right people, right? So she's saying, hey, I want to identify the customers who are likely to attend special events this summer and are more likely to buy our summer collection. And she wants to do a more personalized campaign and not a generic mass campaign. So how does she do this with Amazon Connect? Within Amazon Connect we have customer segmentation and customer trends, so using your customer profile data you automatically get the customer trends available on your screen. Priya likes the summer events collection launch trend, and she starts seeing a segmentation which is a list of customers who have a high propensity of buying if she launches this campaign. She also has the capability of entering a prompt that show me customers who've purchased occasion where. More than 3 times in the last 18 months and who are high valued customers, once she likes what she sees, she can go ahead and create an automated outbound campaign. Uh, it's a simple step to create a campaign. She just has to click on a few options on the UI. She chooses to launch an email campaign, and once she likes what she sees. She puts in the time zone, the communication time, and then she just clicks on publish. So very simple, just in a few steps, Priya has used AI to find the right target and segment of customers she needs to reach out to, and she's gone ahead and created a campaign in the communication channel of her choice when in this case was email. Now let's see what happens next, right now the moment has arrived, uh, we have our next persona which is Maya, so she's a frequent high value customer of any company retail, and she's having a Saturday coffee and she just received a personalized notification that, you know, there's a summer collection launch. And she thinks it's perfect timing, so let's see what happens next. So she receives an email that your summer collection awaits. We're giving you a 15% off, and she can also chat with Stella, which is an AI agent or an AI stylist that any company retail has built on Amazon Connect along with the fire algorithm models that I was talking about earlier, and I'm gonna show you what happens when Maya starts interacting with Stella. So Maya logs into the app, she browses on the app. She's looking at some items, right? She's looking at a champagne silk dress, a navy midi dress. So before I play out the demo, I just wanted to share that she's browsing through a lot of items. So we are capturing these clicks, which is a part of the profile, and now we're gonna use those clicks to give her a more personalized recommendation. So Maya is just browsing, she's gonna scroll down and then she's also gonna start an interaction with Stella, who's the AI stylist that's built on Amazon Connect. So Stella recognizes her and says, I noticed you were looking at the champagne silk dress. Are you shopping for a special occasion? And Maya says yes for a wedding next month. So Stella wants to know, tell me more about the wedding. Where is's wedding? So apparently it's an outdoor wedding in Napa Valley. And she wants a cocktail attire, so this is where the product recommendation algorithm kicks in and provides personalized options to Maya, like, hey, if you're looking for a wedding which is an outdoor wedding, maybe these three are the best options. So Maya does like the champagne silk dress, so she's gonna say, yes, I love that one, but do you recommend some shoes to go with that? So this is where the frequently paired algorithm comes into picture and says that's a great choice and guess what? Customs are buying block heel sandals, maybe a necklace. Do you wanna go for that? Maya says, yes, I love that idea, but there's also a rehearsal dinner, so do you recommend something more casual for that? So the AI stylist now is just providing the top trending or popular items, which is the the other algorithm I was talking about. And makes a recommendation to Maya. So Maya says, OK, I think I've had enough. I've blown out my budget now, so that's the only thing I'm gonna shop, but, um, can I get some discount? So once again, the AI stylist based on AI recommendations is proposing the insider applied program to Maya, which she chooses to enroll in and gets some more 38, um, I think a 15% discount on her total order. Finally, Maya says I've, I've had enough, I've shopped these items, but I do want to get an alteration on my previous order. So to do that, the AI stylist says, OK, I'm gonna transfer you to the right agent and I'm also going to transfer all of this context to the agent as well. So let's look at the agent experience. How are we, how is Agentic AI helping the human agents deliver a personalized experience to customers too? So for anyone who's not seen this before, this is the Amazon Connect agent workspace out of the box. We have agent Jordan who's just received a chat coming in from Maya. With all the context and history, her customer details showing up using customer profiles. And then Jordan is also looking at Maya's profile explorer once again an out of the box feature within customer profiles. It uses AI to analyze Maya's profile, give her overall customer value, and also give her overall customer satisfaction scores. Some of the next steps, uh, recommendations that, um, the AI assistant is providing that, hey, probably Maya is asking about the previous order history, let's go and review her order history. And also Probably ask her a few questions, hey, which, which is the dress that you wanted alteration on? And once Maya suggests that, Jordan seeks the help of an AI agent on the right that hey, is this customer eligible for a free alteration? So the AI agent accesses uh knowledge articles which are available in the back end and integrated with Connect and says yes they are and why don't you use the step by step guide and just follow the steps and provide Maya the free alteration and also uh book her appointment for the alteration as well. So as you see, in just a few clicks, the human agent was also empowered to use AI to provide the right personalization to Maya and address her query within just a few seconds. So that's more going from segmentation to seeing the AI agent in action, but let's also talk about observability, right? We have our AI agent, it's out there, it's helping customers, but how do I know as a supervisor that it's doing the right job for me? So this is where we wanna close the performance loop. So Priya, back to Priya, she's launched this campaign. It's run for a few weeks now she wants to know how effective her campaign was and was the AI agent effective at all. Once again we have recently launched automated evaluations for your AI agents as well. So Amazon Connect always had evaluations for your human agents, but now you can also evaluate your AI agents. So in this screen you can see you have a unified dashboard of your self-service AI performance, how many contacts are going through the self-service AI, how many active AI agents, also the AI coverage by contact categories, right? How many were. Using the shopping stylist, how many were contacting for returns, returns and refunds, and then you also get a trend of the AIH and performance tools. You can also see invocation by latency and that there's just a lot more rich data that's available out of the box. You also get detailed. Contact records. So in this case you can see an evaluation score not just for the human agent but also for the self-serve agent. And on the, on your right and my left you can see the overall evaluation score of the AI agent and the self-service success and the customer experience. And in this case apparently the AI agent did a very great job. It did an upsell and it had a 90% score. So that's more on the out of the box features on how you can evaluate your AI agents, but as always, all of this data is available in the raw format as well. So if you wanted to build your own custom dashboards using Amazon Quick Site. You could also create a campaign metric which Priya is using right now where she can see how many emails were sent, how many emails were opened, what was the revenue that she's achieved either through the email opening, the app browsing, the whole journey of the customer, right, and eventually leading to membership. And you could also create dashboards for multi-channel performance, how you're performing in your apps, how you're performing in your emails, and what's the relevant revenue associated with each of those channels. And also your top AI agent actions, how are your product recommendation algorithms working? How are your upsell algorithms working? So those are the kind of insights that you can provide to tie back to real business outcomes. With that being said, let's talk about some real business outcomes. So for that we have Jack who will take it forward from here. Thank you. Yeah, so those demos you just saw weren't art of the possible. These all demonstrated what's available in Connect today, mostly out of the box with some minor customizations. And so to help illustrate that, we have 4 customer examples of production workloads taking Connects capabilities and providing personalized outcomes. Now these examples range from 4 different industries and a bit of, uh, some overlaps in some of the features, but mostly different parts of Connect, all for the common goal of delivering great personalized outcomes for the customers. So we're gonna start with Saks Global and GoStudent to sort of compare and contrast the similarities of how they use Connect. So Saks Global is an international luxury retailer with both a historic and iconic physical presence with Saks Fifth Avenue as well as an e-commerce division launched in 2021. They've been a connect customer since 2022 and have found great results in providing their live agents with good interactive details for their customers in these live call handling situations. They're able, they're able to use both the data that flows through their systems to make sure all their agents have the right information at the right time. And they're also able to use Connect's conversational analytics to analyze the customer sentiment so that they're able to have their human agents understand the intent of the caller and make sure they deliver the most empathetic and accurate responses with accuracy. Now my wife, she's actually a very loyal Saks customer. Uh, so often she'll buy 10 dresses online, try them all out, pick 2 to keep. I take the 8 to return, the physical location. I come back home, there's 10 more boxes, rinse cycle, repeat. And ultimately this is kind of a problem for myself but great for her. She has no problem and the few times that she's ever had to call in for help, they've been resolved so smoothly and seamlessly it just maintained her loyalty throughout and this type of smooth, seamless personalized engagement is also what go students to provide for their customers. Now GoStudent is a little bit further than East 5th Avenue to the east, uh, based in Europe. They are a, uh, continental, uh, provider of tutoring via online resources, and they use customer profiles from Connect today in order to help engage their customers with the right accurate responses. And the way they do this is they're able to use customer profiles to understand. Where the customer came from, their past interactions, and make sure they make the right routing decision of how to hook them up with the right specialist to help engage them for their topic. Ultimately this has helped them with their conversions of getting new clients and they're now looking to combine customer profiles with their outbound engagement capabilities in order to go through their leads list of potential clients and using AI to filter through many common questions and topics before a contact ever reached a human agent in order to speed up the process of converting them to a sale. And so ultimately, um, GoStudent believes they can increase their agent productivity by 20%, handling that many more conversions through this combination of an outbound engagement with our customer profiles for more personalized experiences. Now they're a pretty good example of just like Sachs. They started off with an inbound contact center use case, but they're transitioning now to also expand and enhance with outbound engagement. And this is sort of very synonymous, the journey of Connect overall. Probably many of you have started with Connect as a contact center, but ultimately it is just a customer engagement platform that helps you deliver personalized experiences wherever your customer is. Now moving even further east in Europe, we're talking about Sunu. They are a leading e-commerce platform in Qatar, and they focus on delivery services. They help with grocery deliveries, uh, food deliveries, as well as pharmaceutical products, among many other business services. And they've used AWS overall for their personalization AI and which helped boost their ROI by 47%, uh, 407X, um, but additionally they're now looking to use those personalized, uh, recipes, those personalized AI models talked about before, in order to even go a step further in improving their conversion rates for sales. And so this looks like for them for two possible use cases they're exploring now is one will be, uh, proactive suggestions of reorders. Looking at the customer's purchase history, the timing of it, and making proactive suggestions of, hey, you should order this again or potentially making this a recurrent purchase, and additionally, the crossal use case, given their platform nature and their wide types of products they can sell and deliver to their customers, they're gonna have AI models from our. They'll span and look across different merchants, different business services to find the right cross sale opportunities at the right time for their customers in order to maximize that that customer value and honestly make the customer in a better situation with more seamless transactions and deliveries. And so this is a combination of what's already in production today and what is coming out just now as of this week. And the last example we provide is United Airlines. They've been a long time AWS customer. In 2024 they went under a project to upgrade their media service and in the process they noticed that their existing. Uh, custom entity resolution for customer profiles that was an on-prem system was having some issues with quality and durability and ultimately had led to a duplication of 15% of their loyal uh customers' accounts. So ultimately they had to go through a process of figuring out how to clean that up. And initially after they scanned this for disloyal, they found out there's problems across the whole base, and they ultimately settled on Amazon Connect and Amazon Connect entity resolution with this entity resolution capability, which is an AI feature that scans different accounts, resolves duplicates, and makes a complete centralized set. They're able to reduce their duplicate entries for all users by 35%. And additionally, in the process of migrating from on-prem to the cloud, reduce infrastructure costs by 30%. And this is all from the features that predate reinvent, um, but I will mention a quote later on from United of one of our new upcoming features that just launched this week. So speaking of launches this week, um, normally when we talk about in these presentations the new features that come out, there's maybe 3 or 4, and we dive deep into them, uh, but this year is a little bit trickier, uh, because we actually accelerated our feature delivery velocity and now have 30 features that came out this week as part of Connect and each of them, whether directly or indirectly touch on personalized experiences. So, uh, to maximize the time we have, we've only cherry picked about 9 of them. And we'll walk through different categories of them. Now the main common theme between them is they they do ultimately tie to agenda AI. Ultimately this is the trend that's going through the world and very much so in the industry of customer service. And likewise for Connect it's a very powerful step function improvement on what you can do now. In many ways some of these features are new AI technologies for automation, a step function improvement, what you can achieve and what you can stimulate. But additionally, as part of Connect, we really just view it as software, another step in a journey of creating better outcomes for customers. As such, all these features around agentic AI span across all of Connect, uh, all the different features we talk about outbound, inbound, different personas, it just weave, it weaves throughout, uh, so the four buckets we'll focus on have to do with. AI actions, the real-time engagement with customers and employees, and how AI helps there. Additionally, how beyond automation AI can help your your workforce improve their skill sets and solve harder problems and uplevel faster. The third category is really about taking all the data that flows through your business and your contact center and using it to transform that data into meaningful customer relationships and lastly, a pillar for how to accelerate your outcomes using all the analytics and insights that we can provide you. So this is gonna be a lot of material and I'll go slow, not rush through it, but not take too long. I just have 3 takeaways before I dive in. There's only 3 things you remember from this deck. I, uh, for this part of the deck, I'd recommend just one, we have AI agents connect. They're out of the box agents but also customizable, uh, to meet your business needs. As such, you can 2, personalize them to your customer experience so that you can make every interaction have a nice tailored touch, and 3, we do have out of the box features around personalization to make it easier and lower that lift. So starting from the top, AI agents and connect, this is something we've been working on for the past year, and now we have a rounded out solution where our previous agents that provided assistance in self-service and human assistance, more informational based, can now take actions. They're able to take an input and provide that output by acting on an environment on behalf of the end user. Now as part of this, they're also able to retrieve the right information and as such make it a very personalized tailored experience, but it also gives you the flexibility to just make sure these agents can automate the steps you need to. Now as part of this, it's generative AI based AM powered, but we have taken a stance with Kinect to really allow you to have deterministic flows where you need them. I'll talk about this a little bit more, but there is this notion of using flows in our flow modules in order to interweave deterministic workflows where you need it, or just on your choosing to go full genic, it's up to you. Uh, one last call out because it won't be uh, the rest of the section in terms of collaborating with agents that might live elsewhere in your enterprise, this type of multi-agent collaboration, uh, as of today we support the collaboration of agents via third party MCP tools. So out of the box agents, I alluded to before, we have some existing agents for self-service and human agent assistance, and we've extended those as of this week can now provide action automation. These actions can be completing, um, updating transaction systems of record, but also retrieving information autonomously from disparate sources. But additionally, as part of these out of the box agents, we also have a slew of new ones such as case summarization, task recommendation, and a preview announcement of an agent scheduling and forecasting agent, and ultimately this is just a showcase that as part of Connect we really view AI agents as just another feature. And one that for any of these different types of workloads we're going to provide ways to enhance those experiences in as turnkey a manner as possible since Connect is first a managed solution that does still allow for interoperability. Um, so I want to preface with this slide first just because these are the agents we have now and there'll be many more. It's just part of our overall strategy, but now I'm going to turn to some customizations. These will be the most technical slides in the deck, um, but since these have been the most common asks we've had from a lot of customers, some of the audience, I want to make sure we call them out. Uh, the first one, the most technical slide, is about model context protocol support. As of this week we officially support MCP, the framework for anthropic, that really provides a standardized way for AI agents to take actions and retrieve information. As part of this launch, we have some tools, LM tools that use MCP protocol, and they're provided out of the box. These include the ability to have an agent create a case, update a case, start a task, retrieve customer profile information and insights, um, and many more. But additionally, we also, maybe most importantly for all of customers, supply the ability to have third party tool integrations. This is all powered from Amazon Betterrock Agent Core Gateway. This way you have the ability to set up servers throughout your enterprise, whether your own division or sister divisions, and you'll have the confidence that you can take these tools and integrate them in your contact center when and where you need them, whether it's for the constant AI agent use or even just for occasional lookups where it might be. Now in the middle between 1st party and 3rd party, I do want to call out uh for those existing kind of customers that we have taking flow modules and we have turned them into tools as well so you have the option to go through your flow modules and just hit a button and add them to your own MCP server posted by Connect. And the reason why we did this is one, we noticed that the schema is pretty much the same. There's inputs, there's outputs, there's descriptions, so why not make them tools? And two, it gives you the ability to build business logic once and whether used in a static workflow, a human-led step by step guide, or an agentic workload, reuse it, ability to build once and reuse wherever, whenever. Additionally, in order to do third party integrations, this also gives you the affordance to keep using your lambda blocks for data dips and transactions as part of an agentic workload and connect. Now, um, this is the main customization that is new. You can take your out of the box agents, um, tailor them how you like, add different tools that meet your business needs, make your own tools, but this is all part of the bigger picture about how we let you customize the agents that live and connect. And so these customizations start at the prompt level, um, for those who don't know, uh, for all the out of box agents for self-service and human-led interactions, we expose our prompts so that A you see what they are, uh, but B, you can actually go in and tweak a little bit, or C, delete and rewrite your own. This really lets you tailor these AI agents to your use cases and your unique needs and ultimately, um. Adding your knowledge bases, multiple to each agent now, as well as uppercase guard rails such as PI redaction, content filtering, as well as the tools we just mentioned, this ultimately is just the different capabilities you might need to personalize the experience. This way the AI agents that you deploy ultimately know any information you need to know about the customer, know it at the right time, dig deep, and wherever the data lives, these agents can extract it, pull it in. And provide the right reasoning for action execution, action recommendation, and just providing personalized help. So this is a sort of key part of Kinect, just the ability to customize these agents. And before I move on to the last technical slides, I just have to call out that although we have built on top of AWS AI services for these features, it helps us move faster and move at the rate of ABOS. We also have provided our open model selection. We're relatively agnostic, so as of today you can choose between the Amazon Nova family as well as the anthropic cloud family up to Sonnet 45 later this week. So a lot of these performances we've talked about really do lend itself really well and customer self-service, not featured in the stack, but as part of the Kinect launches we have an Amazon Connect Novasonic integration that really allows for these human sounding engagements that while not personalized strictly in the data that comes from the reasoning part, it really provides this human sounding interaction that makes the customer feel really cared for. Now this is a huge step function what you can do for self-service, but this is not the only place that AI agents extend to. And very important to us that you have this ability to take these AI agents and use it to augment your human workforce. And so as a key pillar of just how we've approached AI agents and connect is this ability to not just interoperate between your APIs, what agents can do, but interoperate between what workloads your humans do and what your agents do. So already before today you had the ability to pick when and where to deploy an AI agent, whether it's at the start of a contact, maybe just an offshoot for some Q&A, and also likewise it can be the choice of when does an AI agent maybe loop a human into the conversation. This could be via asynchronous tasks that it needs for back office approval before proceeding, or it could be just escalate to a human with our escalate to human out of the box tool. And so this gives you the ability to sort of pick and choose and design your experiences of how to blend AI with human workloads, but ultimately it allows you to help them work in concert. But having them work in concert doesn't end once a contact is transferred. Once a human actually employee has the contact, we have the ability to provide an AI agent assistant that helps them guide them all the way through the contact or just recommendations for key pieces of conversational turns. And so what's new from what we didn't have before is the ability of task automation. Now the AI assistant is able to do back office backend work, just execute transactions, look up information dynamically, all in the vein of autonomous reasoning as AI agents like prone to do. But additionally, we've enhanced the ability to provide step by step guidance. So whether it's the start of the contact, providing an overview of what the human agent should do, or dynamically in the interaction, providing suggestions. So maybe your IVR is providing really good information gathering of what the contact is about routing to the right agent, give them a nice summary and a static view, but it turns out that this customer has a second intent, a second topic, or just in order to solve the primary problem, just a little bit extra information about a purchase order history needs to be retrieved maybe for warranty considerations. Before today, using Connect in particular, you would have to program it so that the human agent clicks through many screens, maybe 10, just to find the right information, tell the customer to wait on hold as they gather it. But now the AI agent can autonomously just gather information, populate to the agent, and this way the human agent can really focus on talking to the customer, being empathetic, and doing things that humans are best at. So these are what I just presented are really in many ways foundational, um, but there is a question now again well what about personalization? Yes, these agents can automate actions and it's very transactional, but what about going back to the ability of personalizing things and for this and our new capabilities, a lot of it centers on these predictive insights, not just having connect as an ability to sort of populate just static information, but really help generate ways to find improvements in your workloads. So what I showed before is really how you can customize what we provide to bring in your data, which is still very true and apt, but now I'm going to focus on things you can now do out of the box, and that goes back to one of the earlier slides we had about our predictive insights based on our own Amazon personalization models. These models put them out of the box, and for each of them we have tools to let you gather those insights at any time in an interaction. And so as part of this, there are 5 models in particular, and they really lend themselves well to that cross-sell use case or upsell use case wherever it's a chance to find a better OI and a customer delivering to them what they need and maybe things they didn't know they needed. But additionally, one thing I sort of hinted at is while we have these as tools that they can be used at any point of interaction. What I mean is whether it's a static workflow or generative, you're able to leverage these insights so the AI agent can do it just LM tool calling at any moment. It's an autonomous actor. They can get the insight, then make a suggestion directly to the end customer or to a human colleague. But even in your workflows and contact flows, you're able to query for these insights and decide with conditional rules, OK, we have an insight, let's populate it, or no insight, let's move on, and really add rules to that flavor. You can really get a chance to both get these automatic insights but still tailor to your user journey that makes sense for your business. And by journey this really blends well with our latest reinvent launch for outbound campaigns, customer journeys. Traditionally with Connect our outbound campaigns were focused on one customer touch 0.1 channel, but as of now, as of two days ago, you can now design an entire customer journey, whatever interaction might be for proactive engagement. Now these can be cross-channel. Our newest channel support is WhatsApp, and you're able to filter in different conditional rules, weight logic, follow-ups, whatever makes sense for your journey. You can now build and connect both for API, but maybe more importantly from our visual designer. That is very much akin to our existing visual designer and connect. So you have just one workflow experience no matter what type of engagement you're trying to build, inbound or outbound. So ultimately this really gives you the control you need to reach out to customers proactively since again Amazon Connect is really just about customer engagement whether inbound or outbound, but also gives you the hooks to just use our AI models whether you're going to lean into agentic AI or not. These AI is there for you for a non-engenic world still. So now I want to come back to the United quote I mentioned before. And so besides using existing technology for the results I showed before, they do plan to use these personalizing capabilities with customer profiles to deliver better outcomes. Ultimately they use customer profiles today to get that complete customer understanding, and they now want to take that understanding, user out of the box AI to deliver better proactive engagement every step of the way of a customer journey. And so the example that they're looking at right now to try to implement has to do with pre-ordering meals. That way before a customer is opening up their app and maybe busy running to the airport, there's already a proactive suggestion of what meal they might want to order based on their previous history, inclination to buy, and maybe some other insights about that customer. So this is an exciting opportunity for one of the world's largest airlines to. Take advantage of one of the world's largest customer engagement platforms, but personally I'm very excited since um I'm based in New York. I fly out of New York all the time, a hub of United, so I personally plan to take advantage of whatever proactive recommendations they come out with very selfishly. Now the last section of our new features that we're going to cover has to do about how do you manage all these AI capabilities and in particular these new autonomous AI agent actors, these AI agent workers, and so when it comes to this dilemma for some or opportunity for others, we really view these AI agents as just another worker, a virtual worker. And whether you're managing a workload that's going to be human led or AI-led or mixed, what matters most are the outcomes. You're building a customer journey and you're measuring it against customer outcomes, customer KPIs, and everything else is ultimately just an implementation detail. So as such, when we do this in Kinect, we've throughout the system, whenever we have an opportunity, we're taking existing Kinect features and reusing them to apply to managing AI agent workloads. And now the most notable one has to do with what we showed before, and that's agent evaluations. Traditionally this is human agent evaluations, and now it applies to AI agent evaluations, but in particular it actually applies to any self-service interaction. So whether it's a human-led interaction, self-service, structured self-service like our traditional Xbots, or a fully generative AI agent does everything. You ultimately can use the same survey forms with the same customer outcomes of CSAT scores, resolution rates, reopen rates, uh, was the virtual, was a worker empathetic enough? Were they accurate? Just take those same scoring to a contact and reapply it. This gives one easy way to use Connect to do any workload, but two, it also does give a way to tease and phase out your agentic onboardings since you can easily compare how well AI agents work compared to a human worker. Now for this, we will provide in general some proactive insights into like, hey, we think this workload could be automated. A lot of this will come through our new supervisor connect assistant that has been preview announced. But ultimately we just want to give into your control, the customer's control, that ability to govern. OK, when is the time to move a workload to agentic? Maybe it's just routing some contact percentage to an AI agent. Maybe it's the full contact. Either way, it helps you decide where humans are best and also if you have any potential issues with retention and nutrition, it makes you a decision of when do you start hiring more virtual workers versus human workers to handle repetitive workloads. Additionally though, there are times where some things are unique to AI agents, and we still have to that end the traditional canonical AI agent observability. And so these were shown before in those dashboards in the last part of the demo, and for this we'll provide insights in what your agents are doing, how accurate they were, if they're using knowledge bases, what articles are occurring, how often, and really providing you the insights on what are the virtual workers doing. Now this gives you the same audibility as human agents. In fact, for every contact record now, you don't just see what AI human agent was on the contact, you'll now see what AI agent was on the contact and even the tracing of what do the agents say, what do they do this way again, regardless of the workload and how you deployed it, the contact record is a source of truth of what happened, no matter who the worker is. Now one of the benefits of AI agents is that it's it's still a machine. And to the best of anyone's abilities, we'll be able to peel apart, OK, well why did you say that AI agent? What was your reasoning? What was your thought process? Give us a train of thought, uh, something that's a little bit harder with humans. We're not always good at explaining ourselves and definitely not at scale. So those are things that will probably be unique to AI agents, and we're always going to invest in that ability to make sure you get the same observability you expect outside of Kinect. It'll be part of Connect since again AI agents just another feature in Kinect. But, uh, to that point though, we do find a lot of commonalities again in how you measure agent and agent performance, whether human or AI. So that note, even something like hallucination rates, while we will have it for AI agents, it's probably something we're gonna look at for humans because I could have made up a lot of things today. Who would know, but we would have the same scoring criteria to govern that because ultimately it's just about the final outcome, the final results. Um, so with that, that's all we had to share, um, for today's deck. And so with any call to action, I would say that with all these new capabilities we've launched this week as well as the ones we had before, just recommend, give them a shot, try it out. Uh, these new agentic workloads really opens up a lot of doors, and there's no better way to see what works for you than trying out our new personalization models and, um, seeing what you think and providing us feedback. Uh, so thank you for your time and um if you have time, it'd be great if you open up your app and provide us feedback via the survey. And for those who um have any questions or follow-ups, we'll be out of the hallway taking any questions whatsoever, whether it's about this presentation to cover today or anything else about Connect. uh thank you for your time. Yeah, thank you, thanks a lot.
