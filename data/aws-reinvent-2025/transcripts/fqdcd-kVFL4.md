Hi, uh, welcome everybody. Uh, if you are looking for closing the gap between seat and safety shipping faster at scale, you're in the right place. Uh, so thank you for coming. It is 9 a.m. in Las Vegas, which is either 120 if you're from the West Coast or 6:00 a.m. if you're on Vegas time. So thank you all very much for coming. Um, I'm Edith Harbaugh. I am CEO and co-founder of Launch Starkley, and with me today I have Jeffrey Goldberg of Click and Nate Gray of Ali. And do you wanna give a brief intro of both of you and your roles before we get going? Sure, I'll go, I'll go first, uh, Nate Gray, um, Ally Financial, uh, Ally Bank, you might have seen the commercials. We're the largest, uh, digital bank, uh, in the country. Uh, I am, uh, over digital engineering operations, so primarily, uh, customer facing applications and, and, uh, the APIs that, that interact with them. And I'm Jeff Goldberg. I, whoa, and I work at Click. Uh, we're a data integration analytics and AI software company, and I am a product manager responsible for a number of different areas in the platform, and I help our developers, uh, with tools, bringing in tools that help them, uh, with their productivity. So I'm gonna give a very brief overview of Launch Sharkley. Uh, this is not meant to be a vendor talk, it's meant to be them discussing software, but I wanna give a little level set about what Laun Sharkley does. Uh, so I started Launch Sharkley in 2014 as the founder. And the reason why I started it is because I kept feeling the same pain over and over again as both an engineering manager and then as a product manager, which was that releases are hard, you know, back then we did a release once a quarter and every time there's so much anxiety around is it gonna go out OK, you know, because back then build pipelines were they were already gay, and then even beyond that after you ship. Is it gonna fall over and go thud, basically, you know, the, the fingers crossed, I test a lot in a server, in a, a server, uh, that was in production. I tested a sandbox, but now it's in live in production. Is it actually gonna work? And then work has a lot of different definitions. After you push it, is it actually delivering business value? You know, something could be working fine, but customers hate it. Uh, so from all that, I came up with the idea for Launch Darkly, which is basically a runtime control plane for features. Uh, where you can. Launch, measure, and control features after, so you can launch them and then measure and control them. Uh, from that over the last 10 years, uh, we've continued to expand on what it means to be a future management platform. Uh, so now Launch Starkly allows you to release something. It allows you to observe it and allows you to iterate with it with our experimentation engine, and we do all this, uh, via a base of 20+ SDKs. Uh, if you are using a language we probably have it. Uh, and if we don't have an SDK for it, it is probably something like cobalt where we cannot physically do it. But anything else that you want, we have it. Set top boxes, uh, devices, we have an SDK for it. And the goal of all this is to de-risk every release, um, you know, as a former, as I said before, as a product manager and engineering manager, when something goes wrong you feel it very viscerally, um, that something has gone wrong, it's bad on the field, and even more than that, that under stress that you have to fix it. Um, so if something goes wrong, you have this panic feeling due to cortisol, and that is actually the worst time to make a decision. Um, some of the worst releases I've had happen is when something goes bad and then there's this panic moment of what version do you roll back to, how do we roll it back, and suddenly you're trying to roll forward or roll back and cherry pick and you somehow end up in a worse mess than before. So our goal is to de-risk every release by allowing you to do, uh, self rollbacks at healed. And also to allow you some new features we've built over the last 10 years, uh, to allow you to accelerate AI development, because with this ability to do quick rollbacks and girded releases, you can have a lot more confidence in what you're doing. As well, we can help you experiment after it is released. So if you have functionality that you want to see whether people like different AM models differently, you can test it out. And all this happily coincides very nicely with uh not just uh developer productivity but developer happiness um this is a big uh goal of mine. You know, if you have confidence that things that you ship, if something goes wrong, you could quickly iterate on them, it's a lot easier to ship. Uh, if you have stress and anxiety about, oh, is this gonna work, is it's not gonna work, that's what I think that development really slows down. Cause then suddenly have a lot of uh. Meetings or conference calls about how confident are we, which is its own operational drag. Uh, so that's a brief overview of Lunch Serkley. Uh, now I'm really gonna turn it over to a group discussion about the gap between, uh, speed and reliability. Uh, I'd say for a while this was seen as a false dichotomy in my mind, that you can either go fast in the Facebook model of ship everything, break everything, who cares? Or I'd say the slow and steady of let's ship uh once a quarter and really make sure it's right, and the reason why I feel like this was a false dichotomy is because if you have a quarterly release it's actually more likely that something goes wrong because you have so many fixes, so many things working together that it's much more likely that something will break with all this, uh, combination. I, I feel like if you ship more frequently with smaller units of value, it's a lot easier to isolate what's happening and that it's actually much easier to get more reliable software. Um, my, my joke is, uh, you know, so I, I used to be a big time runner, and the joke is that, you know, you go to the doctor and your knee hurts, and they say, well, you know, if your knee hurts, stop running. Uh, if you're a software development company and your releases are always broken, you can't just stop shipping. It's, it's not a valid answer to say, hey, we're, we're never gonna ship anymore because all our releases are terrible. Uh, the, the right answer is let's keep doing this until every release is easy and reliable. Um, so I have a couple of questions for panelists, uh, just to get started. Uh, and I will ask you both to answer this one. how do you feel like cadence has changed in your own orgs over the last 10 years? Like how have you bridged this gap between speed and reliability? I'll go first, yeah, sure, so, uh, we've moved from an on-premises product to the cloud, and I think that that has been, uh, a key. Point of moving from those quarterly releases or we were releasing software 5 times a year uh for an on-premises product to now just continuous delivery of features of bugs and that really transformed the the development organization. It really became. Uh, something where the developers were really very happy because they were just constantly, they were feeling like they were able to achieve velocity, they were able to go ahead and just, uh, keep moving, keep, uh, progressing, uh, in, in different iterations of the software that they were delivering. It's interesting though that now we're, you know, 5 or 6 years into our, our cloud journey and. Uh, we have some desire to offer certain capabilities from a continuous perspective, but then there are other features that we want to hold back, but it's not necessarily because of any sort of like engineering drag or anything like that. It's more about marketing and, and the integration of product marketing and thinking about how release is now more about moments. In addition to being able to push and ship, uh, more frequently, so it's, it's coming up with that balance that we're working on right now. Yeah, it's, that's a pretty common pattern of, uh, sometimes there's a, a reason why customers don't wanna see something right then like if you're doing a big promotion around Black Friday, you don't wanna show it in August, right, right, exactly, and for us we have uh large enterprise customers that. Will, uh, what they like to do is they like to essentially preview features before they're released. They like to do things like build their own documentation, even though we have documentation, they like to build their own enablement. So what we're beginning to offer in the new year is a way for customers to configure their tenants through just a toggling capability, a different release channel that they want to have their their tenants release or receive different features. So items that would be on a monthly or a quarterly release will be determined by product management, product marketing, and the engineering team in collaboration with one another. And they'll go ahead and they'll set up the targeting rules to set that up, but, uh, if your tenant is set up for continuous, you'll actually get those features as they ship, and that gives the customer a lot uh more confidence because they can control, uh, how they distribute and allow their end users to, to consume these new capabilities with uh better support models from their side. And are your developers happier now because they can decouple release from deployment? I think that that that's still, uh, you know, something that is uh where there's some still still some growth uh opportunity. I think we've been in, uh, we've been in a centralized model for release management for such. Long time because even though we moved to the cloud we still maintain more of that on-premises mindset of release, but now we have close to 400 developers and engineers that have access to toggle feature flags in production. And so we've decentralized and given the development teams more control. They're, they're gaining more confidence because they have that capability. They're more thoughtful about when flags get toggled, and so we've seen incidents go down, and that helps raise their confidence as well. Coming back to your point of do we need to have these gates and these meetings to feel like we're confident. Now they have the, the wherewithal to, to have more control over that and take action if they see anything that doesn't look right, immediately. Yeah, how about you? Yeah, developer happiness has been uh. Has been a, a key driver of of our tech modernization actually uh we, I wrote a blog post on Ally tech blog about um how Ally got our nights and and weekends back uh you know, we were doing the quarterly releases, then monthly releases, but they were always, um, middle of the weekend, right, for a, for a bank if someone can't log in to check their, you know, check their account or or transfer money or pay a bill, that's, that's a really big deal. So, so like we can't cause customer impact. Um, but also engineers can't work 45 hour weeks and nights and weekends, uh, so what's the solution? Yeah, uh, launch directly was a big part of that, uh, through Feature Flags. So now we do, um, we went from, yeah, I say monthly, but, but it was, it was monthly releases plus, you know, a handful of hot fixes, uh, that, uh, obviously are always rushed out and, and ill tested, um, to, uh, this year we're averaging 68 releases a month, um. Across about 15 applications, uh, we feature flag every uh every UI change, uh, we do API first, uh, development, so the API we've separated APIs from UI deployments, separated releases from deployments, um, APIs go in, uh, for the UIs we then target, you know, the new version of the API with phased rollouts. First we do customer pilot or employee pilot, so. Testing and production. Everyone says don't test in production. No, please do test in production. That's the only way you can actually test what's happening in production, right? Um, so create segments for our internal pilot team, um, then 1% rollout to, um, to customers, 5% rollout, um, up to, you know, up to 100% as long as all the metrics are, are tracking. That's great. Like, what, what changes have you felt in your own team with getting their nights and weekends back? Yeah, I mean, I'm a, I'm a father of, uh, of two boys that, uh, keep me very busy and, uh, I, I, you know, I preach work-life balance to my team. It's, it's really important to me, um, I have the benefit of having, um, leadership that agrees with that and, um. So we can ship at 5 p.m. as soon as the stock market closes because we have the confidence that we know before we're gonna break something, uh, we can, you know, we can back out that pilot even if we, uh. Even if we do cause customer impact, it's not a 30-minute pipeline deployment, it's a 32nd, you know, flag flip. Um, so it's, it's improved, uh, developer satisfaction tremendously. What what changes have you felt in your own team with the, the change in cadence? I think, you know, from. Our, our developers, they really like that they have that flexibility, but I think one thing that you, you were just saying. The separation of deployment and release is really where they feel more they feel more comfort. I think that there was such a tight coupling before. Now there's this confidence that they can deploy, they can just continuously deploy as long as they have, uh, they've, they've set up their, their flags to, uh, to basically deploy dark into those production environments and then they're able to very. You know, very granularly turn on whether it's through a phase rollout or a release pipeline or using, uh, guarded rollouts. We've just, we just implemented, uh, guarded rollouts in the last couple of weeks, so we're just starting our enablement there. But in terms of uh the uh functionality of using different targeting rules, it's really interesting to see the, the maturity of the teams as they go through and they, and they, and they work through those things. Uh, they've really started to I guess enjoy being able to say, oh, I, I put it on this tenant, so I'm gonna invite you to this tenant that I have internally so that you can go ahead and take a look at it. We're. Uh, we have some announcements this week, and those are, we're, we're doing some private previews, so we're working with, uh, you know, there's a, again, a collaboration between the development team and product management to establish different segments for those different, uh, previews that we will do throughout the, the, the journey to a generally available product, and it's just wonderful to know that we can keep delivering that software into production. With aspects of it still turned off because we can be super granular with how many flags we wanna have, how we bring the flags together from a prerequisite perspective, and we also tie it in with access control too, so we, uh, on the back end and the front end. So that we can, uh, make sure that when we do release, we're not only releasing just uh, uh, uh a UI a UI change, but we're implementing the access control that goes along with it and, uh, it, it, it's really looking at the, the, the, the full feature across multiple flags and teams like that kind of granular control. Where do you feel that there's still risk? Like, what are some non-negotiable guardrails, and this is for both of you? Uh, for, for us in a, you know, we're a highly regulated industry, um, you know, auditors and, and regulators are, are regularly checking that, um. Every Glab production tag aligns to uh an approved CR with test evidence and um scans are all done appropriately and so um. So it's regulatory compliance risk is a big one for us, making sure that we're doing everything by the book, um. And then, you know, resiliency, being able to, to. Uh, instantly know if you're, uh, if you're causing trouble and, and, and flip that flag back. In, in our world, we have 22 different, uh, uh, pieces. We're, we're FedRAM compliant, uh, products, so we, we have to sometimes separate what is released in our commercial environment and, and stage that release before we're allowed to bring that into the federal environment for the purposes of, uh, audit, and we have to go through audit processes and that sort of thing from a significant change perspective. So that's one non-negotiable piece and we make sure that there's that separation of duties and that there's the, the, the people who can access the, the FedRAM environment, uh have a mechanism to uh uh turn on and set up the, the flags in, in the right way. And then I think one of the other, uh, you know, things that we've been able to do because of our decentralization of, uh, the Devev teams really owning their releases and owning their feature flags now is, um, really being confident, uh. Before you turn a flag on for all, right, default, default true is not, uh, not the, the, the, the way that you start working on a flag. You start with default false and you, um, you protect yourself using the targeting rules as a guard rail. So those are some of the, the pretty. I guess light, uh, non-negotiable pieces on our commercial side because we've been so restrictive in the past that's actually caused more incidents than it's actually, uh, prevented. Can can you tell us a little bit more about how has being too cautious caused an incident, um, if you can, well, yeah, so again it comes back to something I think I said a few minutes ago where when we were in a, um, even as we started to decentralize it was still kind of like this hybrid approach where we had a release champions team, right? And again it's about having knowledge of your future and someone who's a release champion. May not necessarily be in the same uh domain or org, but they're being, you know, asked through Slack, hey, can you flip this on in production for me? And they're just like, yeah, sure, no problem, and then all of a sudden it's like, you know, support calls start coming in, uh, you know, errors start flowing through into Splunk and, and everybody, you know, you get, uh, all of a sudden you have 250 people jumping into an incident channel and Slack. Now that the the ownership is fully shifted to the dev teams, um, they don't have to ask anyone for permission, they're in control, we treat our developers like adults and. Uh, and responsible people and they care about. That they don't want incidents, they want their, they, they wanna make sure that their code works properly in production, so this level of control just automatically solves the, it solves the problem, it solves it, it solves itself. I, I, I definitely felt that, you know, I got into engineering because I liked building things and when we had, uh, you know, I'm old enough that we used to have like annual releases, that's just really painful, you know, because you're working on something and sometimes by the time it's ready to ship it's obsolete. Um, but if you can release once a week or once a day, you get this little, you know, kick of joy of, um, well, a, are people using it and also if they're not gonna use it, I at least know that sooner, you know, well, this is the next phase for us is really getting into, I was, I was mentioning the private preview that we're doing for some of the, uh, new, new features that we have coming out, uh. Soon and getting into more experiments, so we've, we've turned on all of that observability parts we're engaging our design team to uh to facilitate more experimentation through Launch Darkly. We're building out capabilities that allow our customers to opt into uh betas and previews and different parts of our release model so that we can get feedback. Earlier, so that we can actually put something out there that I, I think you were saying it at the beginning of the call where, you know, you're, you, you think that uh the, the meta approach where you, you're throwing something out there and just let it break is, is bad. It's, it's not that it's, it's bad per se, it's a choice. It's how you con it's how you control that decision. And that's the, the, the exciting part about using Launch Darkly is it gives you so many different opportunities to and, and, and, and control not in a negative sense but control in a positive sense the feedback loops that you establish whether they're customer driven, where the user's opting in. Or there are experiments that we want to run, whether it's AB testing or doing something where we allow our customers to, you know, operate in a canary mode or do blue-green deployment, that flexibility for our development teams and for our design teams and our product management teams just. Enables better quality outcomes for our customers, we will end up shipping. Lovable, like, not to use the company's name, but you know, uh, the lovable and features that our customers crave and they look forward to. Yeah I mean that that's, that's, that's what we're all here for is I think is, uh, you know, it's fun to see, you know, bits and bytes turn into real experiences for sure. Uh, along with that, you know, I have to ask this 2025, uh, how are you approaching AI and how it plays into your own release cycles and your own software development? And, uh, either you can. Uh, we treat, um, we treat models like features, um, so you know, they're the, the, our, uh, enterprise AI team is, um. We have a cust we have an employee front end for like a chat GPT type experience that that is 100% feature flags um and then for the AI configs um models are being uh treated like features and and phase roll out and and measured just like uh any other customer feature would be. In our platform where we're our customers are, are ingesting a lot of data into it and then either running uh running that through transformation pipelines and analytics and then we have, uh, the capability to build out assistance that you can deploy out into and embed into, uh, other ecosystems. What we need to be thoughtful about is how, uh, our customers. Want to treat that data and where they want that data to go. So being able to give them the opportunity to control the artificial intelligence capabilities of where they can pull data from is really important. So like, uh, I'm not gonna, I'm not an AI expert, but Chris, uh, cross, uh region inference, I think is, uh, something that has become really important for our platform as our customers have data residency and sovereignty concerns. So we are offering a, a, a way for our customers to use uh different versions of our AI platform based on a toggle that they flip that, uh, calls a launch darkly API, adds them to a segment, and then enables their, uh, enables that feature, allows them to start using that cross-reference, uh, cross reference, uh, or cross region technology so that they can. Uh, enrich their AI products and it's again it's just that kind of uh integration is, is really great to provide to our customers as a, as, uh, a way that they can control, uh, a certain set of features, uh, for those types of use cases and that's how we're enabling AI, uh, uh, capabilities alongside what you, what you were saying just from like a feature functionality perspective. And, and ironically our head of AI, um, was a launch Darkly user in his, in his previous role that we acquired, uh, that company and so he already came over asking for, uh, for feature flags. But which company was that? It was, I knew you were gonna ask that, uh, oh, I felt like I should know it and I don't. Yeah, uh, it, it was a point of sale lending company. I think I know. I, OK. Well, I, I guess I stated at the beginning that I feel like there isn't really a choice between speed and reliability. I, I guess to put it back to you two, do you feel like going faster has made your software more reliable, or what do you still struggle with or think about in your own processes? There, there's still. I mean, going faster brings new complexities, new challenges, right? Espe I mean we, we broke our monolith APIs into microservices, we broke our, um, our, um, web architecture into a micro front end, uh, and so there's a lot more moving pieces, but they can all be independently deployable, uh, so giving that freedom to, to. Uh, we have a rule that essentially everything, uh, every application, every deployment has to be independently deployable, uh, and so that's how we've managed that, that new complexity that, that came with, uh, with moving faster is getting rid of dependencies everywhere we can. That's smart. Was it, was it hard to go through that process? Did you? There were certainly some, some learning, yeah, some lessons learned, uh, throughout the way, some, uh. You know, we, uh, I'm not gonna lie and say we, we didn't take down production once or twice, but, uh, I think everybody here probably has done that. For us, the reliability piece is, uh, really important because of, again, the, just the feeds and speeds of the data and the way that our customers, uh, use data to take decisions every day. So what we've been trying to do again, to help the developers have a greater level of control is using context and making sure that the, uh, the full product set is context-aware of the user or of the tenant or specific services. That are in place. So one of the things that we've implemented when we see a degradation of a of a of a particular service from a reliability perspective is we've created a string-based uh feature flag that our SRE team can go in and toggle a debug mode for a specific tenant. And so now they can actually, so they can uh identify the support will identify a customer that's having an issue. They'll supply the tenant ID. The SRE will go in or um the dev team will go in, uh, they'll add the targeting to that specific tenant, turn on debug mode, and now that will change the logs that come into Splunk so that they can actually do more of a forensic analysis of what's actually happening across the services that they're using. So, but only for that customer, but only for that customer, only for that tenant. So like we have, uh, we, we have OEM products. So we have customers that have thousands of tenants in, in in production as end customers of their SAS solution are embedding analytics. So being able to uh trace that and have that level of control that, that drives reliability. So I, I kind of feel like your question about speed and reliability, yes, they kind of go hand in hand, but what, what we've been able to do is. Actually decouple it right? We, we use the platform to drive those use cases separately reliability in terms of like the shipping faster just comes from what we've been talking about, uh, relative to the, the access and the control that the developers have to, uh, uh, of their features, but this piece really helps us, uh, um. Shortcut any sort of uh like real digging into any code to really understand what a problem is because we can just turn that on and turn that off as, as needed to uh identify problems and that reliability is, is really great. And then what we can do is again through segments is we can uh control regionally what. What things, what things are happening. So if it's isolated to a specific region, because even, even though they're, you're in production, we're in 15 different regions, uh, you know, ghosts in the machine, they happen, um, you can basically set things up so that as you're fixing problems, you can isolate, uh, you can isolate down, and that's where the context piece really, really helps and shines with reliability. Yeah, so, um, so Launch Darkly is actually a, a big customer of Launch Darkly, um, so we, we serve trillions of, uh, features every day, and we do a lot of interesting stuff. Uh, people think of us as just serving features to users. Um, a user can be a machine, like a user can be an API, um, so we can really, uh, dive in and if, uh, you know, we're getting session calls that are not good, we can, you know, block an IP, block an API, and do that very quickly. Yes, yeah, and, and I think, you know, uh, to log roll a little bit, uh, on the launch Darkly part, I, I see that not only from, uh, that ability to isolate because of context, but that also. Uh, percolates into just the usability features from an administration perspective. So, uh, as the, um, the, effectively the product owner for Launch Darkly, I take a look at, uh, at like authorization and, and, and, and, uh, how roles and, and teams are set up and what I love is the granular, uh, uh, way that we can scope. Machine tokens or users and they're actually born from the same access control model and that is, uh, especially with what we're doing in the release cadence and with the, the, um the Chris toggle that I mentioned we have basically just instead of, uh, you know, having uh an API token that can basically do a whole bunch of things it literally can touch those two segments it can it can write. Uh, it's, it can write to those two segments, and that's it. That level of granularity and control is just, it's, it's fantastic. Yeah, we, we have a lot of people who use us for device management, um, for example, you know, if you know that it's not gonna work on this version of Android, just block it. Don't, don't have a bad user experience. Yeah, yeah, it's very cool. Uh, What are you thinking about in terms of where you want your release processes to go? I mean, it seems like you both are pretty forward looking. Is there things that are still on your road map, or do you feel like you are in a good steady state? Yeah Automation, uh, I don't know what. I don't know what automation really looks like, right? I mean, I know, I know we want it. I know, um, the more automation the better. I know that the automation we've put in, um, has, has made significant improvements, but, but in a regulated industry I don't know, I don't know that we'll ever get to like, you know, one button, uh, full automation, uh. There's gotta be some human in the loop along the way, um, but automating as much of the pipeline as possible, automating, um, testing. The difficult part for us with production validations is, um, when you're validating in production it's a real bank account like like you're our our developers are logging in on release calls to their personal accounts and, and you know moving money and purchasing uh shares and um that's really the only way we can do it. There's actually there's a team. That um was supporting um auto payments that for a for a time they didn't have anyone on the team that had an auto loan through Ally so they would have to ask for volunteers to come uh to come validate so production validations are have always been a challenge. Anything we can do to automate that, uh, you know, that's, that's where we wanna go. Yeah, it's, it's so true. I mean, I, I don't, I, I bank like anybody else. I, I, I want the number to be right. Autommation, I, I completely agree with what you're saying. The, the ability for our developers to be able to, and this is where I see like guarded rollouts and, and some of the other capabilities, uh, coming into play, that automation and then allowing our customers to choose in certain, certain cases so that our developers are focused on. Shipping features, not necessarily getting calls to say hey can you toggle us on for this particular tenant they wanna try this out, right? because uh you know we're, we're in the middle of a of a of a an engagement or something like that so being able to support those types of uh use cases is, is, is huge and that's where the, the automation comes in the tighter uh integration with the, with, with the products that and then. Uh, just giving them, giving the developers the opportunity to, um, work through. The. Uh, experimentation processes and, and have that trigger different work flow workflows either inside or outside of Launch Darkly, I think is another way for, uh, them to accelerate their workflow from a development perspective. Yeah, a, a, a big change I myself have seen over the next 10 years is just the acceptance that automation is good. Um, so you know, when I, when I started the company 10 years ago, uh, when I talked to prospects about hey you can move stuff through stages like the examples you gave, um, and I would ask, do you want to have this automated, they would say absolutely not, you know, somebody needs to flip that switch. I need somebody to flip it. Um, but what's changed, I think, and I think AI has accelerated is people are like, actually a machine could flip it faster than a human. And in fact I do not want to wait for a human, like, um, you know, we have a customer that does payment processing, they're like, if something's going wrong, I want to stop it within a second. Like I, I don't want to wait for somebody to get paged 5 minutes. Like I want a second and then the person get paged, they can figure out why it went wrong, but I don't want that delay. I think, I, I think you're absolutely right. Like it's, it's an. Uh, I, I can't presume what, uh, you know, what developers want, but as someone who's always aspired to be a developer, uh, I, I really embrace automation because if I can not have to worry about that kind of concern and I can continue to focus on building, that's the part of the job that I really enjoy, so, um, to be able to automate that either get an alert, uh, or, or what have you so that or have it automatically roll back it's just like. And that's, that's great, cause I don't have to, I don't, I don't have to, I'm gonna say context in two different ways. I don't have to context switch from being in builder mode to being in fix it mode, right? But then what you're mentioning from an AI perspective, which is so important is that it's, it's all about context. That is what if you give your agents, you give your AI the context of what what you want, you give it, you, you provided the instructions on how to behave when you see certain conditions. It will go ahead and, and, and handle that for you and that you can provide that in a natural language way versus like dragging and dropping blocks, I think is what makes it way more approachable for a developer now than it did maybe, you know, even 33 to 5 years ago where it was like, oh, use Workado, like sorry Worcao folks, uh, it's a great tool, uh, but you know, where, where you're dragging and dropping blocks, I mean we have that capability in our platform with like uh click automate. But our customers want to be able to just, you know, um, be like Scotty in Star Trek 4 and say hello computer and out comes transparent aluminum. Anything to add? Um, So we've, we've shifted left on security scanning, which has prevented a lot of last-minute fire drills. Uh, so, you know, Implementing security gating at the point of, you know, that first merge request, uh, means, you know, we're not waiting on a weekly scan to come in right before the release signoffs. Um, the developers have much more control over the. Timing of those releases and then by um by having everything um independently releasable uh and feature flag flaggable if something comes up that component just doesn't go that release uh and and so we don't have we don't have to back out code uh at any point in the process we just you know decide not to, not to flip that feature or deploy that microservice. Hearing you talk about that again makes me remember the way we used to develop a decade ago and I don't wanna go back. No, no, you know, actually, the, so the first, the first time we used, uh, a feature flag, uh, from Launch Darkly, it was the second week of COVID. And the feature that we were, that we've been working on for, uh, uh, a month or so was, uh, an annual employment verification for customers that certain products require, uh, annual employment verification. Well, when half the world was being, you know, laid off and, and, and fired. That's probably not the best time to, to ask for employment verification. So, uh, but we had this big release that this was before we had, you know, this is at the beginning of our modernization journey, but we had introduced feature flags and. Uh, that one happened to be the, the first one, and we just toggled it off and, and, and everything else was able to release. We didn't have to break up the release package. We didn't have to, I mean, we did some retesting because we, uh, you know, we, we, we didn't know what we, uh, what we didn't know from this new tool, uh, but it, it worked flawlessly and then we were able to delay that, uh, employment verification for, for 3 months and just toggle it on when we're ready. Yeah, that's the that's the origin of our name. That's, that's a classic dark launch, um, you know, where you can ship out features dark and then to your, to your, uh, metaphor default false and then slowly turn them on. Yeah, almost 100% of our UI, uh, releases are now deployed dark, um, validated by just the development teams and product teams in production. Um, for, for mobile it's a little differently, it's a little different because, uh, you know, you, you have to release new binary binaries, um, push those releases out to customers, and, and we get negative customer feedback when we, when we release too fast in mobile. People don't wanna download a new app every time they use it. Um, especially, I mean, if you're trying to check your bank account and you don't have great service, uh, you know, you might not be able to do that because you, you, you can't, you know, you can't wait 20 minutes to download a, a new app, um, and so by being able to, um, By being able to feature flag web and mobile features together, um, we can release web as often as we want, as often as developers need to. Mobile goes in a, in a, a slower cadence, but we're, we're about biweekly now. Uh, and then, uh, once, once all the pilot testing is done on each, then we can flip both of those features on together so that customers, regardless of, of platform they're on, see that same feature at the same time. That's, that's part of the origin story of Lunch Sharkly is I would, I was at Trippi, which is a, a mobile app, and we had that exact use case of, um, you know, somebody is on the road perhaps to Vegas. And they're desperately trying to look at something on their phone now is not the time to ask you to to update your app. That's right, you know, and also, um. They We learned the hard way that some stuff that looked great in a mockup internally in our, uh, user testing, when somebody is running through an airport, they hate it. They're like, I don't have time to look at your beautiful UI. Just make the, you know, make the buttons louder and prettier is not an option, just louder. Um, well, before we turn it over to the audience, you know, any final advice for people on their own journeys? Like you said, you had some of your own lessons learned, but, um, as people are looking to ship faster with more reliability at the same time. What advice would you give them? My advice is. Bring your developers to the product, don't restrict their access to it. I think that's a key lesson that we've learned and. Provide them opportunities to explore. The paths that they wanna take to release their products, right? The, the platform itself provides, uh, numerous different ways to go to market and what I see my responsibility, uh, from a product perspective is to highlight what the different features within. Feature flagging can bring to bear and show them different use cases that they could employ when they choose to go ahead and and and release and that's how we will expand the maturity and. Uh, expand the, uh, confidence that our developers will have to use the full range and capabilities of the product so that they can release more reliably. They will, um, they'll get more hands-on experience with it, and that's what will help drive, drive the speed. Yeah, um, develop our autonomy. I was gonna say that as well, uh, that's when we went through our tech modernization initiative, um, I laid out, uh, release management guiding principles, and I'm, and I did a road show to all of the leadership stakeholders, making sure that everyone's on board with this, um, and number one on that was, um, development teams should have the autonomy to move at their own speed. Um, we, our release, uh, process is like a bus schedule. Like you don't have to get on every bus, right? Uh, there like, um, you're gonna have, um, you have scheduled options, you have ad hoc options, uh, and, and it's up to like the release team is supporting those product teams to get it out to customers, balancing that, you know, speed and safety, balancing, um, customer service, uh, our customers being the product teams we support. And, uh, and, and, you know, our risk management hats as release management so. Giving, giving development development teams the autonomy, uh, to move at their own speed while putting the right checks in place, right, uh, by putting, um, the right gates in place, uh, the right, um, the right tooling, the, uh, we do, um. You said that they have, uh, developers are actually releasing their features themselves. We have a, uh, launch truck has an approval flow built in if you, if you choose to use it, uh, and we use that, so the developer builds the flag, um, submits the request, and then the release team, um, submits the change request, gets that approved, approved, uh, reviews and approves the, um, the change request within Launch Darkly, and then, and then pushes it out. Um, well, I wanna conclude by saying, uh, I know Launch Sharkley is a vendor, but a lot of the techniques that we talked about today you can use without Launch Sharkly, uh, so I hope you learned a lot about how you can improve your own development processes and even if you're not using Launch Darkly, make your developer lives happier and reduce risk. Um, I would like to now open up to questions from anybody. Um, we don't have a runner for the mic, so you'll have to speak loudly. Uh, and I will, uh, ask the person in front because you, you sat in front. Um, so my question is how does that tie. If you're doing, let's say, doing dark releases, when do you actually update? semantic versioning, why don't you update the. police number. Or the tag for So we do it, um, we actually don't use, uh, I'm sure he just doesn't want me saying this, we don't use feature flags for our APIs yet so so the UI. Targets the new API version, uh, so you, so we'll deploy a new API version that sits in parallel in production, uh, nobody's calling that yet and then one by one those, those consumers will repoint via a feature flag, uh, and, and phase roll out over to, to the new version. Does that answer your question? I think so. I, I, I mainly work with the platform, so I provide, uh, pipelines for teams to be able to push. Um, so we, we increment our version and we, every 3 weeks, we push out changes. It'd be nice to be able to push out releases or. Employed items without teams having to necessarily go always keep updating their version. That constant So what, what we're looking into, we, we haven't done this yet, but as we're separating deployment from release, what we are looking at is how not only would you do, uh, a blue-green deployment but also like a blue-green release where you are tying the, the feature flagging to that version so that you can go ahead and actually phase roll out, uh, from, from that, from that perspective. Um, the other way that we do it, the way that we do it today is we do, uh. I, I mentioned we have a lot of different regions, so what we've done is created segments that have, uh, regions of different profiles in what we call zones and as part of our release pipeline we'll release to zones, we'll evaluate, make sure that, uh, things are working properly, and then the teams will go ahead and continue to, to move those new versions or turn those new versions of the software on. Uh, in release, so it's, it's really trying to provide that one part that is, that is handshake. We're again early days there, but there's the functionality to, uh, to support it, and our customers are also looking for it like I mentioned earlier with respect to just the release cadence piece where some of, some of our customers wanna have a tenant that's canary that's basically getting. Like nightly updates, so we're gonna try to figure out how we can, we, we can provide that so that their tenants can run in a canary mode. There's, there's a couple other techniques, but we can take that for after, uh, uh, you were just because you were persistent. Uh, you're right there, just talk loud. OK. I have a question for you. Um, sorry for this question, but you'll understand. Yeah, OK, um, are you able to hear me? Yes, yeah, Edith, I'm really sorry for this question, but I, why should I not build my own launch darkly using AI and like I, I love that question. Sorry, I love the question. Don't apologize. Yeah, OK, uh, so there are two parts. What, what I always look for. One is like open source tools which will do the things, uh, for which I'm paying. Or if the open source versions are not available, why can't I just give Cloude or any of these tools, uh, like instructions to build what I want, and it will be specific to my deployment and my release. So why should I not build it and why should I look at, uh, launch Docly? Uh, that's a great question. And number one, the reason why I started the company is because I think just using feature flags is a better way to use software. Um, so I'll say if you have simple use cases, 100% just build it in-house. Like if you're just like, hey, I just need some simple on-offs. I have some very simple release processes where I have a beta group and a non-beta group. Probably could do that yourself. Um, I think if you have a more complex situation like the ones that you just described, so we had our own, we, we did purchase Launch Darkly, I think back in 2020, but we were using our own feature flag management service, uh, because we had, you know, 15 services, we're now 300 services and growing, right? We're adding new services every week and so. It's just not a concern we want our developers to have. So I think to your point, right, it, it all depends on you reach a certain size and scale where you, you, you need to offload that concern and where all. Developer has to do is add a few lines of code to do an evaluation and then all the aspects of being able to have a finer grain control just works works for our teams so that they don't have to worry about that piece. I know Nate, you're in a regulated industry, so you might have something to add about why not just have AI build it. Yeah, uh, well, we haven't looked at specifically that question using AI to build it, um, but I was actually hanging out with guys from, from Flickr last night, and they, they claim that they, uh, created the first feature flags, yeah, yeah, I know, and, uh, but they're also launch Starkly customers, so like, uh, that's how I know, yeah, so I said. Uh, well, clearly, like they were, so they said we, we, you know, we invented feature flags and now we're paying for this service. Why? Because, because they do it better. I, I don't claim that we invented feature flags, by the way, just let's say that we make it easier. I just have a follow up on that uh if that's OK, um, so when you're saying that, uh, so my problem there is that I don't want to be vendor locked in and then like I would want to build things which are only specific to my deployment. I, although I understand where she would have, I mean like her company would have much more expertise in that area. But we would know much more about our stack. So I mean how do you measure, uh, that, that when is it good to go to a vendor and when is it good to build it on on your own? I mean, I think that's a broader question than Launch Darkly. I mean, uh, we're at AWS where I hope most people have chosen a cloud vendor, um, if you really wanna build something yourself. I mean that's your, your decision. Yeah, I would say if you're, if you're a small dev team, everyone's using the same languages and platforms, maybe it makes more sense to, to build something in-house. We have, um, hundreds of dev teams using, uh, different languages, different platforms, uh, uh, different frameworks, and. You, we would need, uh, an entire platform team for, to support feature flagging, which would be probably more than, uh, I'm sure it would be more than what we're paying launch Starkley. Uh, somebody over there had a question, I think, or. Uh, so my question is, uh, trying to understand how this works in your company. By the way, I'm a very big fan of feature flagging. Uh, so you mentioned, Nate, that your company moved from one release a month to 68 releases, and my, my team moved from one release a month to about 120 releases. We just, you know, we say just keep on shipping. Uh, one of the problems that we get into is, uh, the flags, they get overwhelming. And now the problems that we have is we don't use Launchdocly currently uh we use an open source software but there are overwhelming number of flags and no one knows how to you know which one to remove which one to keep uh is there is there kind of a governance that you have in your uh teams? Yeah, and, and they solve for that within the platform. I, I should also say. Um, we're not paid to be here. It maybe it sounds like we were, we're just fanboys like that. We're, you know, we're huge fanboys. Uh, actually they pay us because they're customers. That's right. That's right, yeah, uh, and, and so within, within the console, um, they have a stale flat. module where you can go um any any flag that hasn't been um hasn't been called in uh 3 weeks or something like that uh there you can set your parameters but there's there's specific definitions for stale flags. There's a dashboard where dev teams can. Um, do that either every sprint, review their stale flags, do that, um, you know, every other, every 3rd sprint, build it into their, into their workflow so that they're just reviewing what flags are no longer getting called so they can clean up that tech debt along the way. Yeah, uh, for us, it's a combination of, uh, the code references capability that's in, uh, launch Darkly, so. You add a GitHub action that basically has Lunch Darkly scan for feature flags inside of the the repo, and then it reports that into the projects inside of Lunch Darkly. So you can go into a specific feature flag, and if you have got a flag that's actually operating across multiple repos, you'll be able to see the repos that it's, uh, that it's used in, and then you're able. To define how many lines of code you want to show inside of Launch Darkly where the feature flag is to determine whether or not it's actually something that's safe to remove and then like you're saying there's a number of different um affordances within Launch Darkly. There's some default rules that exist that look at flag evaluations, uh, time that the flag has been. Uh, existing, uh, to, uh, and, and it will start to indicate, oh, this is ready for code this, this flag is ready for code removal. Oh, you've removed it from all the codes, so now it's ready to archive and those, uh, those affordances. We can, we take that and then we, uh, provide that information to the team so that they can go ahead and, um, uh, build into their sprint plans, any sort of flag cleanup operations that they, that they need to make sure that they take care of to maintain hygiene. Yeah, we actually just released a hygiene agent, uh, at GitHub Universe that will help analyze that more automatically. Oh, I need to look at that. I love it. Yeah, um, and, and it came from again as, as, you know, being around for over a decade is, you know, I used to see, uh, if you used to search for future flags, the number one hit was an article not written by me that said future flags are the worst kind of technical debt. And it was people who were using some sort of homebrew, homegrown solution, and they just were accumulating so much crud of like stale broken flags that nobody knew what to do anymore. And it's like, future flags are the worst kind of technical debt if you're not managing them. There are, there are, we've found a couple of use cases for permanent feature flags though, uh, for, um, if. If, yeah, let, let's say, uh, you know, a, a key vendor goes down and we have an outage in our, in our website, we have flags that can send up a coach mark to say I'm sorry, like we're experiencing technical difficulties right now and so that flag is just always out there and we just flip it on when, when we need to, um, but for the most part, you, you're, you're gonna wanna clean up flags once they're no longer being evaluated on a regular basis. Yeah, we, we have some customers who if they're getting, uh, floods of traffic either from a, a denial of service attack or just something that could just put up a graceful failure, which is much better than the entire site just collapsing. uh, I think, I think we have time for one more question if there's anybody. Yeah. Hi, sorry, um, so my question was already asked, so I have a different one now, um, about the reliability of feature flags. So the biggest concern that comes up when thinking about, uh, launch sharing and discussing with the management is, um, not necessarily the cost, uh, because you can still explain the cost benefits, but, uh. The reliability on something which is served from an external third party server uh to look at and say that OK, if this goes down then this was the last uh guardrail that we had before everything is displayed to the customer. Yeah, maintaining, maintaining flag defaults is, is a big part of that and uh you know, uh, we're at the AWS conference last time we saw this was, you know, was the US East outage, um. Where, uh, There were, there were two teams who had not set their defaults correctly and, and, and they went down, um, you know, Launch Darkley had, had some, some, you know, they were in US East One, they had some lessons learned out of that, but, but the people who had maintained their defaults, even when AWS was down, even when Launch Darkley was down, it worked flawlessly. Uh, it, it, it's a great question and you know, similar to that, that, that situation where Law Sharkley helps is having, uh, different services like the relay service. So the relay service acts as, uh, almost like a, uh, a middleware to, uh, go back to central, but at least it's caching, uh, a set of all the flag. Variation so our tenants are actually talking to that first before they go back to launch Darkly uh Central. Any changes that are coming from Central are basically being brought down to that relay and then I think some of the other protection mechanisms that certainly helped us in that in that experience was that when our users are working with, uh, our platform, uh, there's local storage that's being used where. There's flag caching that, that, that happens naturally. So the reliability, uh, from a user experience perspective, uh, is just from my perspective is uh something that is easily mitigated by these different mechanisms that Launch Darkly has in place or, you know, with a small sidecar that you install in your environment that you can, uh, that you can prevent those kinds of, uh, or at least you can for a short period of time. You, you have some protection, uh, from that. Well, well, thank you very much, uh, Nate and Jeffrey. Um, this wasn't meant to be a vendor talk, but thank you for describing the product so well. I appreciate it. Um, can we give, uh, first, if you have more questions, we do have a booth on the floor if you wanna visit it and can we please give our panelists a big hand. Thank you.
