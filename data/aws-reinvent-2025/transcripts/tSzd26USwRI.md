All right. So thank you everyone for coming uh my name is Neil Cawley. Um, worldwide go to market leader for, uh, Amazon Quick Suite, um, joining us as well, uh, today will be Douglas Berquist, worldwide solution architect, um, also Jaraj Bagdi, uh, group manager, um, of engineering. So let's get started. Alright, so, uh, from an agenda perspective, uh, pretty, uh, packed agenda, so I'll, I'll cover a quick overview of Amazon Quick Suite, uh, which is an overarching umbrella in which Quicksight falls into now. uh, Doug will then come and deliver, uh, overview and demo on reimagining business intelligence, and then, uh, Juraj will then cover democratizing insights and into it, and then we'll come back and recap it off. So there's 3 forces driving workplace transformation. So with the emergence of AI, um, you know, you see about a 33% increase in productivity for companies who've adopted. Um, AI agents and by 2028 about 15% of all task will be or business decisions will be, uh, brought, be, uh, delivered by, uh, agentic AI as well. And then there's rising pressure, so those who use AI are about 40% more productive and those who don't obviously, um, is, is not as productive so. There's an ever growing gap from an AI consumer perspective. For the last 2.5 years we've all, you know, loved working with applications in our day to day life, but that we've lacked that functionality a lot of times at the enterprise and so rightfully so, enterprise wanna like they wanna unify and secure things at scale, so you absolutely need that trust. And so this should be very familiar to everyone, right? So obviously you know we all have complex analysis from a bottleneck perspective that's slowing down decision making. Um, there's a lot of time wasted switching between apps and there's about 40+ hours wasted, you know, based, based on like just routine task as well. And that kinda keeps you from a lot of the high value work because you're, you know, switching context between apps, um, and then you're, you know, mining, you know, your CRM tool, your analytics tools and what have you, and so it just leaves a lot of wasted time. So our vision is a set of agentic teammates that can quickly answer your questions at work and help you turn those answers into actions. And so with QuickSuite we're gonna unify those data sources. We'll, you'll be able to take action alongside these agentic teammates, and then you can experience, you know, your company is gonna love the AI experience, uh, from a QuickSuite perspective. Uh, within Amazon we have, you know, 10, tens of thousands of users using QuickSuite now, and so they're very delighted with the productivity. So let's unpack some of the capabilities, the framework capabilities within QuickSuite. So obviously you have your chat agents, right, which you can interact with and share. Uh, research is gonna give you that PhD level, uh, precision, and obviously those documents will be exportable. And then with Quick Quicksight you have your, your dashboards and your visualization. And then wanna cover flows as well because that's gonna give you the ability to automate a lot of those routine tasks. And then Amate is a fundamental way to shift a lot of that business process overhead that you have um in the form of quick automate. Now of course you've been investing in your governance and data security whether that's within AWS or other ecosystems so we're gonna follow that and then. With spaces you can upload all your enterprise data, uh, whether that's structured or unstructured, of course take actions via third parties in which Doug's gonna demo some of that as well and then of course you have that world knowledge via the Bedrock models, um, as well as web search as part of that. Now you could save time searching thanks to the Quick Index, right? So Quick Index allows you to interact with a whole range of repositories whether that's databases, whether that's documents, um, it could be Google Drive, it could be Salesforce, it could be Xira that you're interacting with, and so, um, the index component is gonna allow you to do that. Now as we cover off spaces is a unique way that allows you to kinda create unique knowledge for your teams, right? So this could be very distinct to your department, your division, or even your enterprise, and that's where you can upload your documents. But the key point here is you can focus on agents, on the data that's contained within that space, um, so you could get supreme productivity out of that. Now let's talk through this Alex example here, um. So Alex, you know, for instance, is creating uh an AI agent called Sales Advisor and so the, the key components of this is, um, the competitive information, the past win analysis is part of that sales advisor, and then the product recommendations and also the improvement from some of the recordings that you can upload that the sales advisor is able to give you. Now the other capability of this let's say Alex wants to expand to regions so that's when you can use research as part of that experience to tackle some of the complex, um, tasks related to that. Now in our experience like before research this could take. An analyst sometimes a couple weeks to months to gather all of that data and within a context window now you can shift that time from minutes in some cases depending on how sophisticated it is it could take a couple hours but definitely you're gonna be a lot more productive with research. And so as you think about flows, right, so flows allows you to take those repeatable steps that you know like we typically come in Mondays we all have to reproduce certain reports. It could be MBRs, um, it could be weekly business reviews. This allows you to kinda automate that as well, so flows is a very key component of that. And then as you think about just supremely being able to offer more via the agents you can reorganize your whole business process management um with Automate and that's gonna just uh unlock a lot of um a lot of value for you and we're we're experiencing that a lot within Amazon as well as we roll out Automate as well. And then as you think about Quicksight, um, the ability to perform those data, the data analysis, build dashboards, um, be able to tackle, you know, the sales and cycles and trends and product differentiation, that's what Doug is gonna do in terms of really talking about how you reimagine BI, uh, with Amazon Quick Site via the QuickSuite, uh, framework. All right, over to you, Doug. Perfect, thanks Neil. Um, so I just wanna take a second. I know this may be confusing between QuickSuite and QuickSight. Uh, I do wanna explain, so QuickSight's been around for a few years now. It's the, uh, AWS Business Intelligence Service with the whole host of agentic capabilities we've added, we've now rebranded as QuickSuite. Um, I'll be diving a little bit deeper into Quicksight today, but just so we're clear, everybody understands the difference. So with reimagining BI. With the ability to integrate unstructured sources with structured sources, you get fuller information and customers can make better decisions. With a deeper understanding of that data, uh, you'll uncover new opportunities and then responding faster is easier than ever before with the action connectors that are gonna be included in Quick Sweep. Over the past 18 months, um, we've talked to hundreds of customers, uh, ranging across a lot of different segments from financial services, healthcare, retail, manufacturing. Uh, data silos are a problem across all industries, and that's not just within data like structured data sources or unstructured sources, it's getting the full picture across all of those data sources. I think every single day all of us go from structured data within dashboards to different applications to try to really build a full view on all that information and then take a decision and do something else, right? So we're bringing that all together within Quick to streamline that process. What we've seen in the market so far is with other business intelligence applications, uh, the agentic capabilities are really kind of bolted on to legacy BI. um, there's AI visual creation, uh, automated summarization, NLQ. Now we have all that too, but we're taking a radically different approach. So we're focusing more on the AI engine, specifically the capability, the reasoning, and what it's able to handle. So structured data is one component, but it's not really the whole story as we know, right? We need to look at structured, unstructured data, and that unstructured data can range through a whole host of sources. So we need to connect to all of that and then once that's connected, the AI engine can understand what's inside all of that and build summarizations for you. So we'll quickly take a look at our architecture here. So in our unstructured sources we have knowledge bases, document repositories, uh, ad hoc documents that we all have that we may need to upload to the agents. We have business intelligence with our topics and dashboards, uh, and all of that is included in the quick index. So as Neil mentioned, the quick index is the indexing of all of these sources so that the agent can quickly understand what's encompassed in each of these so that it can pull out insights and understand what those insights are and merge them together to create a full story. So when the agent pulls that information, it's not just a bullet point of this, this piece of information came from here, this piece of information came from here, it'll understand how those sources relate to one another to then generate that picture for you. So within Quicksight we have um one unified experience. So the idea is that we have interactive dashboards that people can go in, understand their data, and then take action from them. I'll talk about that in a second. Uh, Pixelper reports. I've been building dashboards for 20 years. There's always those people who just want PDFs or Excels they're drinking their coffee every morning. We can handle that too at scale, uh, but the power of that is that. That data source that's powering those pixelper reports, it's the same data source that's powering the dashboards, it's the same data source that's powering the chat, so you have the same answer no matter which medium you're interacting with across all three of these. And then the conversational data analytics is the ability to dive deeper into this, to blend those sources, to get the full picture, and then again take action from there. So building dashboards has never been easier. Uh, we now have natural language prompting to build visualizations, and we're seeing two benefits from this. So first, uh, analysis that's done by professionals every single day is done faster. They can type in prompt, build visualizations, get dashboards faster out to their users, and then users who may not even know how to use a BI tool are getting value because everybody can type in a prompt to say show me sales over time. So we're getting a lot of benefit from both groups, and dashboards are being created faster and consumed faster. And then with the introduction of the action connectors to outside applications, users can take the action that they normally would in a third party application right from the dashboard, so I can click on that button. I can send information from that dashboard out to Jira, out to Salesforce, out to Slack, um, and do the same thing I normally would and just much more efficiently. As I mentioned, Pixelper reports. Now these can be delivered at scale, um, because, uh, QuickSuite is a serverless service. There's no hardware or compute for you to manage, so I can serve these up to thousands of users really easily, and again it's using the same data source that all the other mediums are. All right, uh Oh, and then so all of your insights uh in one place, so with the chat, I can interact with all of my structured data and unstructured data. Uh, once all of those are hooked up, I can use. Authentication using my own user to those sources so that it's pre-filtered for me and I can build that full analysis. Uh, one last thing I do wanna mention, uh, we recently released advanced data prep. Uh, so prior to now, um, most data sets were built using SQL, uh, and that prevents a lot of users who actually don't know how to use SQL. So now with the step by step approach, users can create complex analysis and start getting value out of the data faster. And then finally, all this can be embedded into your application, so we're seeing enterprises embed analytics into their internal portals, as well as customers are sharing insights out to their customers. And you can do this in a whole host of ways, so interactive dashboards can be embedded into your application, your customers don't even need to know that it's Quicksight, you just see these nice dashboards and they can interact with them. Uh, you can embed dashboard authoring, so it's called the console experience, so if you want your users to be able to build their own dashboards, you can do that as well. You can drop individual visualizations into the page, so if you want more control over how your application is designed and have visualizations here and there, you can do that. Pixel Perfect Reports as I mentioned, and embedded chat agents just got released, so if you have customers that need access to their knowledge bases and structured data, they now have that available. OK, so I'm gonna go through a quick demo, um, we're uh short for time, so I go through this pretty quickly, uh, a lot of this is online if you wanna go take a look at this and explore further. And let's jump into it. Yeah OK, so, uh, this is a Quick Sweet home screen, you can see all my recent assets here, as well as I have visualizations down below that I can pull in from my dashboards, maybe I wanna look at them every single day. My chat agent here, I have my assistant, but I also have custom chat agents, and I'll talk about that in a second. I can pick and choose the data that the chat agent has available to it. I also can turn on web search if I want to use web sources, I can attach files, and I can create repeatable flows out of that prompt. So I'm gonna go ahead and pick a space here. And I'm gonna ask a simple question, what are our top selling products? So that agent will understand that question, pull back the data from all the assets that are included in that space, and give me some key insights, and I can always see the source of where it comes from. Let's ask a more complicated question. How are discounts affecting our profit margins? So this will typically take a couple of different sources to answer. The agent will understand that question, give me my key findings for uh critical impact thresholds, it will give me a detailed analysis. I can always see the sources of where these are coming from. You can see it's coming from a PDF and Google Drive. It may add a visualization that's relevant to this conversation. And more importantly, down below, it will give me recommendations on what the actions I should take next. So I don't, normally this would take hours for me to do, I can ask a simple question and get it done. If we take a look at our space here, you can see what's encompassed. So I have a Jira connector. I have a knowledge base coming from Google Drive. I have a Slack integration. I have my topic and my dashboard for my structured data, and again, the agent understands all of that and combine it together. So if we go take a look at custom agents here. I'll select my custom agent. We'll ask a more complicated question. So you can see my question's gonna be about discount and pricing uh over different segments, and I want 3 board level insights. So what it's doing here again is diving deeper into this data to build the insights I've asked for. It will break it up by segment like SMB. It will give me some critical discount thresholds that I may need to look at to cut off. And again, finally, at the end here, it will give me more recommendations. And again it'll drop in visuals as needed, and again I can always see the sources, so you may have a question where that information has come from. So let's go take a look at how that chat agent is made here. So I'll go down to my custom chat agent. I'll hit edit. And you can see I can add persona information like your identity, the persona instructions. I can change the communication style of that chat. I can have reference documents that I can use in the future. And my knowledge sources, which is that space that you saw before. All right, so let's take a look at flows. So flows are the capability for everyday business users to automate the processes that they normally would do. Here, I'm gonna have it analyze and display our top moving products. I can type in emia so it can filter it. It will find the top moving products for me, give me some key findings. Give me a summary and the next box it will actually use this uh answer from that to actually tell me if my ads had an impact on each of those movers, so it's not just giving me bullet points from separate places, it's understanding that information and combining it. And then lastly, with our action connectors, I may want to just send that to Slack. I can check the message before I hit send. Yeah I can see it's sent, and we'll go over to Slack to take a look. Now here I'm just spamming my general channel with all this information. All right, so let's take a look at how that's built. In my editor I have step by step on what I want the flow to do. I have my input. In my 2nd box I'm referencing what's input into that input box. My 3rd is using the output from the 2nd box, and then finally, it's using both of those outputs to create a summary and send that off to Slack. I also have a whole host of options here. I can use custom chat agents, web search, general knowledge. I can create images. The reasoning allows me to add logic to these steps, and I can use the quick suite knowledge bases, dashboards, and topics, and I can have users upload documents if I want them to use their information. Alright, so let's finally take a look at the dashboard here. So obviously dashboards have been around for a few years within Quicksight, but with the new action connectors you get more value out of them than ever before. So here I'm gonna open up a Jira ticket directly from my dashboard. I'll pick my project, my issue. I can add a summarization that's coming from the dashboard itself. And I'll do the same thing with the description. You'll see it's using parameters to fill that information from the dashboard. I'll create that issue You can see KAN 139 here. And then on our side, KAM 139, I can assign that to whoever needs it. Right, so I've. Just a few more slides and I'll hand it over to Gary. You can see some of the statistics we've gathered so far and the value that customers are seeing. Um I do want to take a second to talk about the NFL. Uh, the NFL has worked with AWS for years with NextGen Stats. Uh, they've also been using the capabilities of QuickSuite, uh, to create a whole new fan experience. So they decided to give fans interactive visualizations during the combine. Each player's speed and strength in every drill was in the dashboard, and then same thing during the draft. So they created draft IQ with personalized dashboards for each team. All told, over a million users went to those dashboards to actually see these stats, and now that speaks to the power of the serverless. Uh, architecture of Quicksight because it was able to handle all of that traffic without them having to manage the compute. Same thing with BMW. So BMW is using Quicksight in an embedded fashion in their cloud data hub. They have over 10 petabytes of data that they're using, um, and they have 460 data sources that they've combined together for this, and they're serving over 20,000 users every single day. And again, they're not managing the compute for it. It's all handled by Quick. That's why we've introducing Gary from Intuit because I'd love to have him talk about what he's done. Thanks, Gary. Thank you, Doug and Neil, for the introduction. Good afternoon everyone. My name is uh Geraj Bhati. I'm from Intuit. At Intuit, I manage Business intelligence platform. The story we're going to talk about our transmission, what we had done using Amazon Quick Suite. It is about how we are able to have democratizing at scale. Agenda We're going to talk a bit about Intuit. When we go over our vision, our challenges, and success factors which we want to achieve. We're going to further deep dive on the transformation, the journey we traveled. And finally, we're binding up with benefits and lessons learned. One of the mission's art intuits powering prosperity around the world. We are AI driven platform, and we support small medium business, consumers, and mid-market. We have 18,000+ employees and across 7 countries and 21 offices. Data is pretty critical in our organization. And at BI platform, which we are part of data analytics team. My mission at the BI platform is to deliver AI enabled BI platform which can alleviate the endless experiences. In a nutshell, provide AI and BI layer and unlock the AI potential. In order to do it, we had a few challenges which are into the 4 major buckets. First is barrier to insight. Ability to have insight generated interactively, especially on a complex on a large data set. This results in lots of follow up and follow through. Second is Incomplete insight. We have unstructured data from knowledge base, from docs, from text, from logs, ability to create the insight from the unstructured data. Third thing is managing platform at scale. I'm sure a menu can correlate that when you wake up in the morning, the dashboard is not being refreshed, or any of the extract has failed because underlying data has increased, or we need more capacity. And lastly, if we're able to generate insight, ably you take an action so that user don't have to go to multiple systems or click on multiple browsers to have a workflow. And we had some of the success factors which we want to achieve, again, unlocking the air potential. Number one being have a scalable, reliable platform. 2, insights for everyone, structured data and unstructured data, which can be self-service. And thirdly, able to take actions. Imagine you're a dashboard, you can take the actions, you can have a chat agents, you may have a custom chat agents. So these were the critical success factors we want to achieve. To do that, we decided to move towards AWS Quick Suite, whereby we want to use the capabilities of the platform which can be provided. In order to do that, we did a methodical run book approach of transformation, a 4E approach of transformation. First was evaluation. We evaluated all the use cases which are required. Then align ourselves to a strategy which we want to achieve overall as an organization. Once evaluation is done, we focused on enablement part of the area. Here we did multiple POCs, and from POCs we had learnings so that we can pick up the use cases which we want to enable first and methodically drive towards the closure. Similarly, security is an important thing for an organization, having the right security built in. Third thing, having a governance. Imagine you have built up a dashboard and that dashboard has been not used for a while. How to provide governance in that area? How to provide operation excellence in that area. So we did the whole nine yards of enablement. With that, we did education as well, education to our community. Education to our users and various kinds of forums we partner with with AWS team conductive office hours so that we can understand all the features set and enable our users. And finally, expansion. Expansion so that we can use agents at a large scale and having a large scale scalable environment deployed. I'll go back to evaluation a bit to talk more about it. Here we understood the use case of customer success teams, our marketing use case, whereby they would like to have a dashboard summarization and also want to share the dashboard with other users using all the AI features. We did risk analytics, also went ahead understood product analytics and platform use cases. Further, we really try to understand what does a day of life analyst needs. For example, ability to drag and drop, ability to use Gen BI. Ability to have a quick dashboard using natural language, Ability to scale with a large data set, Ability to have a structured, unstructured data and have a dashboard created. With this all follow me homes, whereby understanding use cases and the users. We came with 80+ use cases across 8 different categories which are core BI features, Gen BI, security, governance, cost. Target state integrating with third party tools and also. Resources ability. We did all the landscape. Here is our architecture which it looks like, whereby. We have data coming from structured data and unstructured data. Which is powered by AWS Quick Sweet product, and we do have a dev environment, staging environment, and a production environment. Whereby our admin users can create a dashboard and they can share it with the viewers. Similarly, they can run the chat agents, custom chat agents, and also do the research analysts. This all is powered by strong security, governance, audit, and also authorization, authentication mechanics. Some of the powerful features going back to Doug's presentation, embeddings, we are using embeddings big time whereby we create a dashboard and share with multiple portals within our systems. This provides us self-service capabilities. Similarly, topic Q&A. Whereby we attach the topic to our data set and users are interactively able to use Q&A. This is a very powerful feature whereby we can avoid multiple dashboards getting created, because if there are complex data, multiple dashboards, multiple views. With the help of topic Q&A, the answers can be given interactively. Another self-serviistic capability. 3rd is chat agents. Imagine you have a dashboard in which you can have our chat agents, custom chat agents, and also on the same space you can have workflow autoation buildup so that we can integrate with all the third party tools so that we can manage the change in data, monitor the data. A user don't have to go to multiple browser tabs. Important focus on education. Heavily we focus on education. Knowing our user base. During training sessions, working with AWS on the use case understanding. Creating a documentation. Creating a champions within the organization so that they can go and explain more and more features. With all the exercise we did with enablement, evaluation, education, we could see a patent increase on the number of dashboards from January to now, the count has almost getting doubled. We could also see the user base, which are authors and viewers getting an increase. With that, we are also expanding. We are looking at autonomous agent. We're also using a marketing use case whereby creating a data story so that they can share across to other marketing team. And also operation excellence is super critical, whereby building a health dashboard, so that in the event of extract failure, we have a visibility real time to that area. As we expand, of course, costs will increase, so we are working on mechanics to a charge back. And governance. Imagine your N dashboard being used, having a stronger governance so that the dashboards which are not being used can be retired. Finally, Benefits we could see benefits in the 8 different buckets. We are unlocking the AI potential. Able to have insights generated from structure, unstructured data. Having a chat agents and with the help of automation, reducing the time to have an excess granted. Any milestone we achieve, there's a lesson learned. I'll quickly recap on some of the major milestones. First warnings, start small and scale up big time. Use governance from the day one. Use AI to the largest potential. Spend a lot of time in understanding the use cases, and finally, share wins and success stories. Thank you for listening to my presentation, or you be back. All right. Thank, thank you, Terry. All right, thank you Jerraj. Alright, so let's close this out with a summary real quick. Um, so a couple key points, uh, that we learned today was reimagining business intelligence and so you guys saw all the framework of capabilities that you can do so you could turn those actions, turn those answers into actions, uh, via flows and automate and then you, you really heard from, uh, Jiraj on how to really create a data driven organization, um, and you know the power of doing pro proof of technologies, proof of concepts, and how those can lead to production. Now, a couple different things here. So, um, you know, it's all about those agentic teammates that can help you out instantly move to answers and then answers to actions. And then the important piece is this is all built on top of the security, um, that you already built on top of AWS as well as your other frameworks as well. Um, now a couple different things. I'll just give it a couple seconds here for you to kind of take out your, your, your phones, uh, scan the QR code. Uh, please reach out to us via LinkedIn. Uh, love to, to interact and, um. Provide further demos if not uh assistance with proof of technologies as well? And then a couple other sessions. So there's gonna be a multitude of quick suite, uh, sessions to to attend. So there's chalk talks, there's breakout sessions as well, um, and then, yeah, feel free if you wanna meet, feel free to reach out to us on LinkedIn, um, and then we can get you set up with, uh, in the EBC whether it's a generative AI lounge or a proper EBC as well. But, um, thank you so much, uh, for your time. We really appreciate it and hope you found value out of this. Thank you.
