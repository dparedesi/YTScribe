>> Good morning everybody. At Blue Origin. We're building the
road to space for the benefit of Earth. In pop culture, space
explorers have always had AI partners. Just think of some of
those famous explorer duos from your childhood. The farm boy
and his droids, the starship captain and his voice activated
ship's computer. And yes, even the mission commander whose AI
went rogue. We've long dreamed of a world where artificial
intelligence and space exploration go together. From
rockets to AI at Blue Origin. We're not dreaming of the
future anymore. We're building it. This isn't new for us. Our
New Shepard rocket became the first spaceship to autonomously
launch and land vertically, making automation and
reusability safe and reliable partners. Since then, 86 humans
have trusted their lives to New Shepard's automation across 15
flights, experiencing a view of Earth they've always dreamed of,
the road to space grew visibly and powerfully, and last month,
successful launch and landing of our New Glenn orbital rocket.
This next frontier an increased launch cadence, lunar landers a
permanent presence on the moon is building on that automation
and extending it using the latest innovations in AI. Our
mission to reduce the cost of access to space is accelerated
through agentic AI that learns, adapts, makes decisions that
reasons, plans, and explains its thinking. That's why,
frankly, I think I literally have the coolest job in the
world. We're going back to the moon this time to stay in
agentic AI is one of our new teammates, helping us get there
faster and cheaper. Across blue. The road to space is being
built by incredibly talented and creative people engineering,
manufacturing, software supply chain. As a vertically
integrated company, we run the full life cycle of a space
mission from concept to operations. Building and
launching rockets requires tremendous specialization from
dozens of these disciplines, and that practical knowledge
isn't found in general Large Language Models. It's buried in
our systems, databases, and tribal knowledge. Agentic AI is
the ability to create teams of domain expert agents with
access to specific knowledge and custom tools has completely
transformed the application of AI at blue, taking a
democratized approach to AI, everyone at blue is expected to
build and collaborate with AI agents to do their work better
and faster. By equipping our teams with knowledgeable and
capable agents, we were able to dramatically accelerate the
product life cycle, increase production rate, and most
importantly, reduce the cost of access to space. The starting
point for our builders and creators is our internal
Generative AI platform we call BlueGPT. It's a there we go
blue team. It's a secure LLM and MCP gateway agent,
Marketplace and multi-agent orchestration system built on
core AWS primitives. Bedrock Strands Agents SDK EKS
OpenSearch RDS Lambda. Giving our agents access to all 
leading models, custom Knowledge Bases, and dozens of
tools. Agentic AI has exploded at blue through organic
disruptive adoption. Over 2700 agents have been created and
are in use in production in the agent Marketplace, driving over
3.5 million interactions across 70% of our employees in the
last month. There are so many examples I could give on how
Team Blue is using agents to work better and faster. 95% of
our software engineers are using agents to write code. New
Glenn is using agents to accelerate launch approvals,
supply chain and manufacturing use agents for design changes
and work orders. But what I really want to talk about are
Tearex's. No, not space dinosaurs, but rather an
innovative project at Blue Origin. Tearex stands for
Thermal Energy Advanced Regolith Extraction, and it's a
brand new capability being developed by our In Space
Exploration Systems group to solve one of the toughest
challenges surviving the lunar night. Equivalent to 14 Earth
days of freezing darkness. I have I have part of it right
here with me. And this thing is amazing. As you can see in the
video, the battery, the Tearex takes lunar regolith, or moon
dust from the surface of the moon, circulates it through
this chamber and then extracting the heat through a
lightweight heat exchanger, and then runs it through this
cylinder to save the rest of the the machine from the
sensitive and abrasive rocks. Designed to run for years, this
heat cycle is then reversed during the lunar day to
recharge regolith for use during the next night, turning
moon dust into a battery. While Tearex is amazing, what's even
more amazing is the team of AI agents that helped build it. A
BlueGPT agent helped us with the detailed requirements.
Another agent helped us create the system architecture. One of
my favorite agents, though, is our simulation and analysis
agent, where we're able to automate the iterative design
loops, rapidly improving the product with custom Knowledge
Bases and connected to AI native tools like Ntop for mass
and performance optimization and Asteroid Digital for
deterministic validation and artifact management. The agents
run complex physics simulations, iterate on the design based on
the results, and execute until the requirements are met. All
running on GPU accelerated EC2. Tearex is a great example of
what we see as the future of engineering teams at blue,
small teams of experts working with large teams of AI agents
to deliver the works of Tens and at orders of magnitude
faster than before. The benefits are immense. Using
 agents, our engineers were able to deliver a
performant product over 75% faster than traditional
approaches, with mass 40% improved over the original
designs. Now I get it. Most of you aren't building rockets or
lunar infrastructure, but you do deal with specialized
knowledge and custom tools, and I think could benefit from a
few of our learnings with agents. First, I'd consider you
to think of adoption of AI as everyone's job, not just the
technology teams. Democratize agent creation and use a simple,
user friendly interface led to 70% company adoption. Second, I
encourage you to let the process for innovation be messy,
but discovery easy. A public Marketplace or agent app store
has really helped us here, providing easy to use eval
tools to allow your teams to test and discover their agents.
Third, let AWS handle the LLM agent primitives and scaling,
and focus on building with those tools to solve problems
for yourselves and for your customers. With agentic AI, we
believe that the future is now. It's just not evenly
distributed. We aren't yet developing all of our products
using AI, but we will be. With millions of people living and
working in space. We believe in a world where we can agentic AI
design an entire rocket, where we can launch 100 rockets with
one person, rather than one rocket with 100 people. Our
work with AWS isn't slowing down. We are building an
enterprise knowledge graph on AgentCore, transforming the AI
accessibility of all of our data. And we're excited to test
some of our own custom built models with our autonomous
lunar rover on the moon trained on AWS GPUs. Our talented team
of Blue Origin employees and AI agents will continue to be the
fuel for this rapid innovation. As we build the road to space
for the benefit of Earth. Thank you very much.
