  Alicia Trent and Steve walk through agentic AI fundamentals, why enterprises should start now, and how Amazon QuickSuite provides controlled, enterprise-ready agentic AI. They position agentic AI as the next evolution beyond Q&A, enabling planning, reasoning, and actions across applications to move from reactive to proactive work. Adoption is accelerating: capabilities have doubled roughly every six months, price/performance has improved 100x for mid-tier models, and enterprises now have mature guardrails and infrastructure. By 2028 Gartner forecasts a third of applications will use agentic AI and 15% of work will be autonomous. The presenters emphasize tailoring agents to the way teams work (not forcing workflows into ERP/CRM defaults), integrating previously disconnected systems (ERP, CRM, email, chat), scaling with seasonality, and personalizing responses for each role. Real-world examples include fully automated customer service workflows, autonomous handling of one-third of manufacturing issues, and e-commerce optimizations like tailored promotions and cart recovery.
  To address concerns about “agents running around,” they introduce Amazon QuickSuite (launched Oct 9) as an enterprise platform that connects data sources, enterprise apps, and actions. QuickSuite can research across internal data and the public web, summarize campaign performance, automate notifications, and let teams build domain-specific chat agents. Internal use cases span customer service, finance (automated expenses/invoicing), and e-commerce. Privacy is emphasized: AWS does not use customer data to train models; data stays in the customer account, encrypted at rest and in transit, with AWS- or customer-managed keys. QuickSuite can be deployed in a VPC, restrict by IP/CIDR, and use VPC endpoints (expanding coverage). Identity options include AWS IAM Identity Center (with upstream IdP sync like Okta/Ping/Entra), direct Active Directory, IAM federation, or local users. Roles (admin/author/reader with “pro” designations for agentic features) govern entitlements.
  Governance controls include custom permissions to allow/deny features at account, role, or user level; fine-grained feature restrictions (e.g., exporting PDFs/Excel, creating datasets, flows, spaces, agents); and API automation to manage at scale across hundreds of accounts. Demonstrations show toggling permissions live to remove access to “spaces,” then restoring it, and using the Q CLI to create and assign restricted profiles programmatically. Data governance supports row- and column-level security on structured datasets (Redshift, Athena, S3, Snowflake, Databricks) and ACL-aware access on unstructured/knowledge-base data (e.g., SharePoint, PDFs in S3), so answers only reflect data a user can see. Service-managed guardrails block prompt injection and unsafe content by default, with customer-managed controls for additional blocked words/phrases and options to disable clickable external links. Admin features include managed assets (reassign/share/remove user access), usage analytics (active users, feature usage, popular agents), and account settings for Amazon Q in QuickSuite. Centralized governance can coexist with decentralized team self-service because guardrails and permissions are API-driven.
  The session highlights customer stories (3M, AstraZeneca, BMW, Jabil, Principal Financial) and invites attendees to related chalk talks, workshops, and booth demos to build agents, flows, and embedded experiences. The core message: enterprises can safely adopt agentic AI now by pairing QuickSuite’s connectors and automation with strict identity, encryption, guardrails, and configurable permissions.

Alright, good evening everyone, and thank you so much for joining us today. Uh, I'm joined with my colleague Steve who'll be presenting later on, um, and my name is Alicia Trent. I'm humbled to say this is my 5th year at Reinvent, and it gets more and more exciting every year. Uh, with each presentation what we're finding is that we will continue to accelerate the growth of AI and generative AI. In the past years we've talked about computer vision. We've talked about bringing IOT into machine learning and leveraging it for predictive maintenance. We've talked about natural language. This year we're going to be really focused on genic AI and in this session specifically we're gonna be focused on the fundamentals. Many of the enterprises that we're working with are really excited about generative. AI and agenic AI, however, there's also a lot of concerns, right? How do we manage these agents, right? There's a lot of concern around like agents running around doing things that you can't control, and we'll really take a step back and really focus on what you need to do to be able to scale with confidence and and control within your organizations. So we have a packed agenda and so we'll just get straight to it. So with Agenic AI we believe now is the time to get started. We've been leveraging Agenic AI across Amazon, across many different use cases from the factory floor to getting packages to your doorstep all the way through AWS sales and marketing, driving campaigns to help support our customers. We believe that this evolution happens internally and we've already started to do it within our organization. So within each department we're all tasked with leveraging agenic. AI in the way that we do business on a day to day basis, so this transformation began with the evolution of generative AI. So originally generative AI was an intelligent way to be able to respond to questions, right in a natural way you can respond to questions across complex issues, but the genetic AI now you can plan, reason, and take action. And so that's the next evolution that we're starting to move towards and it's a really an exciting time as we think about how it can transform the way that you're working. So in the past agenic AI or generative AI would respond in a very simple way. Now you could take that and now become a very capable employee to be able to help perform tasks on your behalf. So with Gartner we've partnered with them, and what we found is that customers are very excited about this. And by 2028, about a third of applications will be leveraging agenic AI. About 15% of work will also be done autonomously leveraging generative AI. So those may be shocking, but the real push and the real trend behind this is to be able to move from a reactive to now a proactive way of working. We're able to now take applications where in the past you had to just deal with the applications that were built and in many cases they were built from the masses, right? So if you think about your ERP, CRM system, you had to massage it into the way that you're working. Now with the tools that we have today, you think about the way that you work. You create the agent to help support that. You connect it to the data sources that you're working within. You connect it to the applications that you need to do these specific actions. So think about your ERP, CRM systems. These are in the past disconnected systems. Now you can bring them together and and be able to bring in insights across these systems and be able to communicate via say email or Slack. Again, these were previously disconnected systems, but now you're able to work seamlessly across each one to be able to start to accelerate the way you work. And so the reason why now is such a critical time. As we think about this is that with agenic AI what we're seeing is that it's in the last 5-6 months we're seeing it double in capabilities every 6 months. In the past it was a year, 2 years where you're really seeing this acceleration, but we believe that this will continue to double every 6 to 7 months as we move forward. The other area is price performance, so we're seeing 100x performance in mid-level tier capabilities. So in the past you could perform intelligent AI for basic capabilities. Now we're seeing more and more complex activities where you can start to apply AI capabilities. And the last piece is that we believe that the the. Maturity of the enterprise infrastructure is ready as well. Uh, my colleague Steve will talk more about the guard rails and controls that you can put in place to be able to help perform these actions on a day to day basis. So what does this mean? So now that you have these tools, what we're seeing is the evolution where now you can change your operating modes, right? So in the past you really had to be stuck with the applications you're working in. Now you can start to really start to automate your redundant tasks. You're able to bring in. Data across many different systems and make more targeted responses. So think about bringing in SharePoint information, information on your desktop as well as your structured databases across Stoveflate, data breaks, etc. to bring together more insightful intelligence than you ever have before. Lastly, as we think about, you know, the evolution of this, it's being able to scale, scale as you have seasonality, scale as you see demand. We just had Black Friday, Cyber Monday pass by, and we can leverage, uh, our agents to be able to help scale to that productivity as opposed to hiring new talent to help support this new increased workload. And the last area is personalization. So with these new. Eugenic workflows we can personalize them at the edge. So think about your employees. You can personalize responses for every employee from an IT person to a legal person. You can personalize the responses and the tasks that they're able to do as opposed to just leveraging, you know, tasks and tools that are built for the masses. So some real world examples that we're starting to see across. On as we look across these new capabilities is one around customer service. So in the past it's really been about chat assistance. Now we're seeing us be able to leverage agenic guy to fully automate the customer experience. So you know, not only responding to questions but being able to route these questions, being able to resolve and manage these questions from end to end without human intervention. The other area is around. The way that we think about manufacturing, you know, in many cases these, these issues would come in. It would require multiple handoffs to be able to resolve them. Now we're handling about a third of these autonomously leveraging agenic AI. The other areas around e-commerce. So now we're being able to bring in more data across the web, how our customers are interacting with our website and being able to provide things like new pricing, new paid promotions based on the buying patterns that the customer is having, and in many cases. We're able to salvage, you know, customers who have left items in their cart and being able to convert those to potential opportunities, uh, in, in the future as well. So all of these, what we're showing is that we're able to scale leveraging agenic AI safely and confidently across an organization, and we have the tools to be able to help you be able to do that. So one thing that we, you know, thought through as we're thinking about this eugenic AI AI journey is that, you know, if you think about your work day, think about all the applications that you touch, right? So for me to get here today. And to create this presentation, it took me 7 different applications and tools to get here, right? That include my email, Outlook, included a sauna where I have my projects managed, included Word, included Quip which we use, included Slack, included Teams, included Zoom for me to, uh, record our meetings and record some of these demos here. But 7 different applications and so what does that mean, right? You know, if you think about your day to day, what does that mean? It means that the average worker has to switch between context and and applications many different times in a day and what that means is that the quality of responses are at a lower level. The, the amount of time it takes to be able to bring together. Information or respond to something it's not optimized in the way that it could be and so these are all ways that we believe that you can accelerate the way that you do work and so that's why we've introduced Amazon QuickSuite. So Amazon QuickSuite is really built for the enterprise, connecting data sources, connecting enterprise applications, as well as different systems to help you do your job. So what I'm going to share next is a video in terms of this new application that we've just launched in October 9th, and we will then go into some details in terms of the capabilities to help scale across your organization. Introducing Amazon QuickSuite, a revolutionary solution that transforms how you work. Let's say you're a marketing manager conducting a competitive benchmarking analysis. QuickSuite can conduct comprehensive research across internal data sources and the public internet in minutes. It can also help you better understand your social media campaign data with an executive summary that includes performance metrics, detailed data analysis, and messaging adjustment recommendations. QuickSuite can also help with automating your notifications and even creating custom chat agents, such as a marketing onboarding assistant to ensure responses are highly relevant and specific to your team. Give your employees agentic AI superpowers with Amazon QuickSuite. So with Amazon Quick Suites, just a number of different use cases that we're leveraging across our organization is, you know, when we're leveraging it across our customer service to be able to respond to customer queries and and resolve those issues, we're leveraging it across our finance department to help with invoicing. So imagine in the past in those days where you had to submit your expense report, you had to submit your tickets, uh, sorry, your receipts and information on your travels that you've done. We can automate all of those processes today leveraging Amazon Quick Suite. Uh, in addition, we're leveraging it across, you know, several of our e-commerce sites to be able to help automate the way that they are doing business as well. So some exciting times with Amazon Quick Suite. I'd now like to introduce, uh, Steve to the, to the floor. He'll start to talk about some critical foundations to be successful. In this new world, accessing data, security, governance, integrations, and scalability, whether connecting to internal systems, third party applications, or other agents or actions, we have the foundations to help you connect to enterprise, scale, and, and be ready to scale these applications. Great, thank you Alicia. Hey everybody, good afternoon. Uh So excited to talk with you today a little bit about QuickSuite, how we set it up, how we configure QuickSuite, some of the governance that you can have in place around it, uh, the security, the identity, uh, aspects of it, how do you connect your identities from your enterprise environment into QuickSuite, talk about, uh, again, you know, guardrails and, and how you can implement different guardrails and talk about the security behind the scenes within QuickSuite itself. Uh, so, quick question though is, uh, people familiar at all with QuickSuite yet? Have you tried it out? A few of you, a lot of you actually. Awesome, that's great. Uh, so, uh, excellent. Wanna kinda jump into it, get you a little information about how we think about privacy. And so with QuickSuite your data stays private. We never use your data. For training our LLMs for any kind of service improvement, uh, for anything, AWS does not touch your data. Your data remains your data. It's private within your account. Uh, you control what you do with your data at all times, so we don't sell it to third parties. We don't give it to other, you know, parts of Amazon to, to analyze. It's all kept, uh, private in your environment in your account. And we encrypt it everywhere, right, so we encrypt data at rest, uh, we encrypt it, uh, data in motion, we encrypt the network layer, uh, we use AWS, uh, customer manage keys or AWS manage keys for encryption, so you have that option as well and you have that flexibility to decide how you wanna encrypt your data. On the network side, you can deploy QuickSuite in your account within a VPC. You can connect to other data sources, other AWS applications like Redshift or Athena or Lake Formation or S3, uh, within your protected, uh, AWS environment within your AWS accounts within the VPC. We also have the ability to have IP restrictions, so part of QuickSuite is, uh, is an admin interface, but then there's also the web interface where end users interact with QuickSuite. And in both those environments you could set up uh IP restrictions to restrict access to only the trusted IP addresses, the IP address ranges, uh, known as a cider range that you wanna set. So you have really great controls about restricting who can actually access the data from your only from your trusted networks. And then we have VPC endpoint restrictions as well, uh, and so across QuickSuite, uh, there's a number of different capabilities within QuickSuite itself. Uh, it's built on the foundation of Amazon Quick Site and so the, the name space for all of the APIs are is the Quick Site name space and currently we have VP standpoint support for all those Quicksite, uh, name space APIs at the control plane level as well as the data plane level. We're adding additional. Uh, VPCN point support that'll cover the full surface area of QuickSuite, uh, and you'll see that coming out in the coming weeks in the next couple months, uh, but certainly within the next few months we'll have full VPC end point support across all of QuickSuite. How many One of the big ways to control access within QuickSuite today is through what we call custom permissions, and this is the ability to, you can set granular controls to restrict capabilities, uh, at the capability level, and I'll get into that. I'll show you some some demo clips around that you can control it at either the the user level. At the role level and I'll explain the different roles that we have available or at the overall account level and it's a hierarchy in the sense that um the user level is the most restrictive set of permissions. So if I have a user that's assigned uh uh permission at the account level uh as well as at the user level, the user level permission will take precedent over any account level permissions. There's also feature level restrictions that you can set within uh Quick Suite as well, uh, and it could, and there's different features. So for example for quick site functionality, um, like being able to download Excel files or PDFs or being able to create data sets or data sources, those are the, the finer grained permissions that you can restrict access to again based on that user role or account level. And all this is available with our APIs and so this is something that you can automate. So if you're thinking about deploying QuickSuite at scale, many of our enterprise customers deploy across many, many AWS accounts and have many, uh, instances of QuickSuite deployed. So hundreds of accounts, uh. Some, some, in some cases even thousands, and so, uh, they need to be able to manage that at scale and how you do that is, is through our APIs and so all the permissions that the custom permissions that you set, really all of our governance controls that you can set within QuickSuite are things that can be set via APIs as well. Now the identity and access management front. There's multiple identity options for you to connect into QuickSuite today, and I'll go over them a little bit more later in a demo, but, uh, the four main options. So there's AWS IM Identity Center, and identity Center is, uh, from a QuickSuite perspective you can think of it as a service provider interface into QuickSuite from an identity perspective. Uh, so you can have your corporate or enterprise identity provider like OCTA, Ping, Entra ID. You connect into AWS Identity Center once. Uh, you can skim sync your users and groups, and that AWS identity Center instance, uh, can be used across all AWS applications. And so that's an option that's available for you in QuickSuite today. There's also if you have an Active Directory environment you can directly connect Active Directory into QuickSuite and synchronize your users and groups there as well. Uh, we also have, uh, AWS IM Account Federation as an option. So you deploy QuickSuite into an AWS account. You can set up IM Federation at that account level and then connect your users, uh, into QuickSuite via IM Federation. Now one of the differences there is that. Uh, to manage the group access, you set up and create groups within QuickSuite itself, uh, so you get the users, they, you provision them into QuickSuite through IM Federation, and then you assign them to groups within QuickSuite using the QuickSuite APIs. And then finally you can have uh local users within QuickSuite and so this is where you can just simply set up a user with a user name email uh they set a password uh and they can access QuickSuite locally with with those credentials. Now there's different roles within QuickSuite. Uh, the primary roles are really the admin pro, the, the author pro, and the reader pro. And this is, uh, what you would consider the different types of entitlements that you have within QuickSuite. Uh, but it's also how you can assign users and then assign custom permissions at that role level as well. Now, uh, why we have pro against each of those, that's where the agentic AI capabilities come into play. And so any role that's set with the pro designation on it means that that user will have access to some level of agentic AI capabilities within QuickSuite. We also have some roles from, uh, when, when it was just Amazon Quick Site, uh, which are just the admin role, the author role, and the reader role. So without the pro designation on it. And what that means is you just have access to the the base uh Quicksight BI capabilities that you would have always had if you were just using Quicksight previously. OK Then from a data governance perspective, uh, fine grain access control with row level security, column level security, you can audit all this information collectively within cloud trail. Uh, what's great here is if you're creating a, a data set and you implementing row level security in that data set, then when you create a dashboard from that data set, for example. Uh, when that user goes to view a dashboard, they're only seeing the data that they're allowed to see because you've set that fine-grained low, low level security, so that dashboard is only gonna present data that's that they're authorized to view. And then I just wanna touch on guard rails a bit and there's a couple areas where we implement guard rails across QuickSuite and so there's service managed guard rails that we implement, uh, as part of the service as part of offering QuickSuite to you as a managed capability. And there we do real time analysis against security policies that we set, uh, we automatically enforce it, so thinking about, you know, content coming in, content going out, analyzing it and making sure that there's, you know, there's, there's no potential. Uh, you know, injected content into a prompt that tries to kind of circumvent the controls that are that are within QuickSuite today or within the underlying LLM that's available within QuickSuite. And so we, we, we take care of that at the service level. Then there's certain features in QuickSuite like flows for example or automate where you can use your Bedrock environment as well and so you can choose the model that you want from Bedrock and within Bedrock that's where you can set your additional guard rails as well so denied topics sensitive information that type of stuff that you can set as well as uh you know filtering on certain words or phrases within within the bedrock context of what you're using in QuickSuite. And then there's additional customer manage controls. And these controls, um, again you'll similar in, in some respects to the Bedrock controls you have, so you can set like word filters that'll filter out, uh, certain words or phrases, uh, that you just that you wanna add on top of what we already do as providing as a service. And just to give you a kind of a view at at one of the screens around that, so this is with a chat agent how you can customize the guard rails and safety controls around a chat agent. And so here there's, you know, 3 checks the promptly injection, prompt safety, and block words and phrases, uh, and so promptly injection, that's where it's automatically enabled, it prevents. You know, prompt injection and other LLM type of breaking attacks, um, so again, you know, if you have a bad actor trying to do something, uh, that they shouldn't be doing, we take care of that for you automatically. That's why it's just kind of checked by default prompt safety as well, you know, protect against the common security threats that are out there. That's something that we set. Uh, again, and manage on your behalf and then blocked words and phrases. This is where it's kind of, it's a, a shared responsibility model in a sense we take care of the vast majority of bad content that shouldn't be represented in the workplace, uh, but you can add additional custom words and phrases you want to restrict that content. Another feature or control that you have is on clickable external links and so uh when you chat with an agent and it responds, it'll also reference the documents that it uses whether it's internal documents that you have or documents that are available on the web and you can decide if you want those documents that are available on the web to be clickable links or not. Uh, it's just another control capability that you have, uh, within the chat agent itself. And so this now is gonna go through setting up a new QuickSuite account and just kind of walk you through a little demo video. I'll try to keep up with the video as it's playing. Um, but I'm gonna go ahead and sign up for QuickSuite. And as you see I have to enter a unique account name here so this is the account name for QuickSuite. So when you go to the QuickSuite URL you enter the account name that you want to access and so that's the account that you set it to. Um, here I'm selecting a region and so I select Northern Virginia. And then there's the 4 different identity options that I talked about earlier. Uh, in this example I'm gonna go ahead and use IM Identity Center as the identity provider for this environment. One thing I have to do now is go and set up, uh, an admin pro group, uh, in order to configure this correctly. So I go ahead and search for my groups. I see a Quick site admin group. I'm gonna add that in. I could add additional users or groups. Into additional roles within QuickSuite I could do it here or I could do it later. I'm, I chose I'm gonna do it later and then here's also where you set the encryption, right? So you can use an AWS manage key or your own custom managed key. So we'll go ahead and create that account. I'll click on it and it starts creating. Just takes a couple of seconds to do that. And so you have one Quick Suite account that you create per AWS account. So account created successfully. I can either go directly into QuickSuite now and start uh working within QuickSuite or I can go and do additional management configuration. I'm gonna go ahead and do some additional management configuration in this environment and now it takes me to the main management account page. And so up top what you'll see is it says that I'm signed in with IM permissions and this is uh so when you set it up you have to have the right IM permissions right so you have to be able to create the the instance of Quick Suite. Uh, but then there's also certain administrative functions within QuickSuite that require IM permissions as well. There's other functions that require the admin pro group that we referenced earlier, uh. To function so just to give you a quick view of what that looks like. Basically the high level account type level settings are things that require IM level permissions, so you really use these level of permissions very rarely. Uh, for the most part you're going to be using an admin role permission, so that's a user within QuickSuite itself to do more of the day to day type of management or administrative functions that you would within QuickSuite, right? So, um, you know, managing users, uh, any type of account customizations, managing subscriptions, that type of information, uh, that you wanna do, you would do that through just a regular QuickSuite admin user. Now I'll take you through some more of the account settings. So now I'm in the AWS management console. I'm gonna go ahead and click on QuickSuite. Log back into the account that I just created. And I'm gonna talk first about some of the account settings that are in the top left, so you'll see account settings, manage assets, and Amazon Que. I'm showing this account settings once. Um, you don't wanna go there very often. Uh, we have some protection there in place so you don't accidentally delete the account, but that's where you would go to delete the account. The managed assets function this is a really powerful tool because I can search by user and see what assets are assigned to that user. I can then go in and reassign those assets to someone else. I could share it with someone else or I could remove that user's access to that particular asset. Another nice feature is that I can search by the asset type so I can go ahead and look at flows and it'll pull up all the flows that are active in my account. And I could go there and and share those flows across with different users. Now Amazon Q in QuickSuite, those are account level settings for the Amazon Que features that were available in, in just Quick site. And so these are our agentic AI capabilities to be able to interact with dashboards, interact with data sets, ask questions, ask kind of Q&A type information. And get uh use agentic AI to get responses back based on that data so you can ask natural language query questions and get back, uh, answers based on the data that it's referencing. Next one I want to walk you through is setting custom permissions. And so here you'll see, you know, I clicked on manage positions. I have two profiles set one, the default, and it says account and so I've set that default profile at the account level, meaning that any user in that account is gonna have that default profile associated with them. But when you look at it, when I click in there, anything that's unchecked means that that it's available. So the way permissions work is that you check it to restrict it. So if I wanted to restrict. Uh, research or restrict analysis and quick sight or restrict flows, I would check that box and then the users that that profile is assigned to would not be able to use those features. So you can see here when I uh the next one down I had restrict spaces. Uh, so what I'll do here is I'm signed in as a different user. You can see I have all those different capabilities listed there agents, spaces, flows and research. I can interact with spaces. I can, you know, create a space if I want, uh, set it up. I can share that space. I can basically do anything I want in that space because I'm not restricted from using that right now. So I'm gonna go ahead and create a new space, um, save it. And you can see that's saved and then if I wanted to share it I could share it out. I could add additional data to it whether it's data sets uh and now I could go back and see I have access to that. So this is the the next user and they can see that they have access to the spaces as well. So what I'm gonna go ahead and do is go back into my custom permissions and now instead of having the default at the account level I'm gonna switch it to restrict spaces as. The default profile and it's asking me to confirm that because it's an important request. I wanna make sure that this is what you wanna do. Uh, the effects that happen pretty immediately and so that's why you ask for it, but you can easily remove it and change it back. It doesn't remove any data that you have access to. So now I'm back looking at this user. I see they still have spaces, but when I click on it, I get the error in the top right. So in near real time I've disabled that functionality or restricted that functionality for that user and you'll see it still has, excuse me, spaces listed on the top left in in the nav bar. So I went ahead and signed out. I'm gonna go back and sign back in again. And when I sign back in you'll see that that spaces option in the nav bar is no longer available either. So just by simply restricting spaces restricting it and applying it at the account level this user is now not able to access that space anymore. I can go ahead and switch it back to the default. Go back to that user again. This time just gonna refresh. It takes a couple seconds to refresh the, the UI, but in a couple seconds you'll see, I think I took 33 refreshes here, but in a couple of seconds you'll see that now spaces will be available again, uh, and so it happens that fast, uh, again they didn't lose any assets that they previously had access to. It was just a configuration change that restricted what they could do going forward. You also see then there's feature level restrictions you can set across Quick Suite and quick site. And it gets fairly granular and you'll see as we add additional capabilities within QuickSuite we'll be adding additional custom permissions so you can decide how you best wanna roll QuickSuite out in your organization, right? You may say, oh I want research agent to be available to this group of users and you can and say but they don't need anything else. Maybe they need chat research agent and then, uh, core BI capabilities so you can go in and set. Uh, a policy that restricts all the other capabilities except for those assign those users to that new policy and all they see is the research agent chat and any of the BI capabilities that you wanna give them. As granular as well as so being able to, yeah, like I mentioned earlier, being able to export data you can control if they're allowed to export data or not. Uh, again this is something that can be applied at the user level, at the role level or at the account level. So this is one now how do we do this at scale? So let's say we have again hundreds of accounts. You're not gonna go into the UI every time and try every account and manage that at scale. So you can do this via API. Uh, I decided to use Quiro CLI. I don't know if anyone's used Quiro yet, but awesome product, and I'm just gonna ask Quiro to create a policy for me, set it up, restrict access, and then assign it to a user. So let's see how it does. So we can see I'm logged in as Daphne this time. I have access to all the capabilities within QuickSuite today. Uh, but I wanna restrict some of, of Daphne's permissions right now. You see, there's the 22 profiles that I have previously set. I don't have any set at the account level yet, so Daphne has full access to our Quick Suite. That's what I wanna do is ask Kiiro. In the CLI to create this new policy for me. So simply ask hero in natural language to create a policy. Restrict certain features and then assign it to a user. So Kira's gonna go in, figure all that out, run the APIs in order to make that happen. And then come back and let me know that it's complete. So there it's going through the process you can see it's putting deny filters on things like flows and research. And it's showing. That is now successfully assigned that to the user Daphne. And I also created this uh profile called CLI_ restrictions. So if I go ahead and refresh this page, I'll see that new profile set up. You'll see in the restricts it shows agents flows research and spaces. Those are the things that I asked it to restrict. And now I'm gonna go ahead and sign Daphne out and back in again. And when I do that, we'll see what happens as far as the left nav goes. So now uh all those capabilities were restricted so this user no longer has access to any of those capabilities. Another great feature, especially as you're rolling QuickSuite out and how do you manage it at scale and how do you know are users actually using it, uh, you certainly can look in cloud trail and figure it out. It gets a little complex to do when you're trying to look at all the different events that'll show up in Cloud trail, but what we've done is build some internal usage analytics for you to get a view on. How well are certain things, you know, being used within your QuickSuite environment so you can look at like daily, weekly, or monthly active users. How often are users coming back and using QuickSuite again and again? You can look at the different features that are available in QuickSuite and you can see how often are they using them again. You can also look at certain, like, so users that have the ability to create agents. You can have many agents in your organization. But you want to see which ones are actually being used. This analysis will give you that information and let you know very easily what are the popular agents that people keep going back to, and that gives you an insight into figuring out how do you can you replicate those? Maybe it's really good prompting around it, uh, maybe it's just the way that it's configured that just meets a specific business case or use case, and that's what's driving the adoption for it. That So as we kind of think about uh deploying Quick Suite at scale. Yeah, we talked about streamlining user provisioning. To reduce administrative overhead. And when I talked about those 4 different identity options earlier, things like using identity Center allows you to use your corporate identity provider, sync users and groups into Identity Center, and make those users and groups available in QuickSuite. So a change in your upstream identity provider like Octa or Ping, uh. Is immediately synchronized into identity Center which then immediately synchronizes back into QuickSuite. So what that means is that if you revoke a user from a group membership or add users to a group. That user gets propagated down all the way so they do have access to QuickSuite if that's what that group has access to. We have really strong governance capabilities, uh, through custom permissions that we just saw some demos on, uh, but also again being able to manage at a really granular level who has access to the data. So we talked a little bit about row level security, column level security, and data sets that are created with structured data, and this is from data that's created whether it's an AWS, uh, application like Redshift or Athena. Or even S3. Or if it's a third party application like Snowflake for example or Data Bricks, you can still ingest that information, that data as, uh, a data set, and you can assign row level and column level security to it so you can get that fine grain access control on that as well. And the other part, uh, within QuickSuite. Is so that's the what we call structured data, your database data that's well, you know, well managed then you have uh what we call unstructured data or knowledge based type data. So this is your SharePoint data. This could be just a bunch of PDF files or something that are uploaded to an S3 bucket. Um, but you wanna be able to manage access to those, right? So you wanna ingest it because there's useful information about your organization, uh, that you want to be able to take and have quick sweet reference and help provide answers against, but you also wanna control access to that as well and so you're able to ingest the ACLs with that information, uh, so the, the responses that come back are only responses that that user is authorized to see. Right, so it looks and sees who that what that user has access to it crafts a response based on that user's access and it only presents the information that they're allowed to see. There's a scalable security architecture. We, you know, we talked about. Again, the identity aspect of it, we talked about managing permissions by API and all this, you know, all the security controls you can implement through APIs so you can, uh, scale this out across many accounts. And, and that's how you can do the like the, the life cycle management as well, right? So you can script it, you can put it into your operational procedures and so as users, uh, as you give kind of permissions out for users to create, uh, their own quick Suite account you can immediately put custom permissions on the creation of that account so they can, they can only access the features. That you want them to access so you have the centralized governance capability, but you can also decentralize the ability for departments or teams to be able to to spin up their own instance of quick Suite, make their own connections, create their own dashboards, create their own agents, uh, but you can still have that central governance over over the top. So with that I'm gonna hand it back, OK. Lisa, thank you. So we've talked quite a bit about how within Amazon we've built and managed this application. We have a number of customers that are presenting throughout Reinvent this morning we had 3M present in terms of how they've reimagined their sales and marketing organization leveraging QuickSuite. Uh, also earlier this morning we heard from AstraZeneca as well as BMW in terms of how they've scaled this across their organizations as well. Later this week we'll hear from Jable in terms of how they're creating their workflow automation step by step in terms of how they're reimagining how they're doing work from a manufacturing perspective. Principal Financial. Also be presenting in terms of how they're leveraging the research aspects of Amazon Quick Suite to be able to help deliver better responses to their customers and then a number of different use cases will be on our business intelligence as well as embedding capabilities across our financial and application providers. So please look out for those. Uh, we have a list of different sessions throughout the week. We have one session today at 5:30 if you're still interested to learn more. It's about our embedding capabilities within Amazon QuickSuite. Um, where you can really think about, you know, how you can leverage it beyond the UI and, and, and really embed into the applications that you're working within, uh, in addition, on Tuesday we have a number of chalk talks. So this is a breakout session where you hear about specific use cases in a chalk talk. We'll start to go into more of a whiteboarding session and go into some details, Q&A for you to dive deeper in terms of the capabilities within QuickSuite. And then we also have workshops as well. So if you want hands on keyboard, really be able to create these different flows, uh, automations, agents, uh, we have a number of different sessions that you can go to as well. So these are some other sessions on Wednesday and Thursday, but throughout this whole session there are many different, uh, areas for you to be able to learn more about the session. In addition, we'll also be in the AWS village, uh, so we have a booth A9 through A 10. You can also leverage Amazon Quick Suite there if you haven't already gotten access. We have, uh, ourselves, Steve, myself will be around as well as a number of our essays and, uh, sales and marketing organization to help answer any questions that you may have. So thank you so much for your time. We're really excited for you to spend the last 45 minutes with us. I'm happy to answer any questions or follow-ups after this session or please meet us in the booth to learn more. Thank you so much.
