Thanks, Chris. Yeah. All right. All right. Thank you everyone for joining us. Today, we're going to speak about AI powered co-selling. And um um just to get some, uh, before we get started, uh, this session is primarily geared towards AWS partners who are co-selling with AWS through the ACE program. So, if you are co-selling with AWS, this is the right place to be. Uh, any customers in the room, though? Oh, OK, great, so we have the right audience. Um, all right. Um, I'm gonna ask you a quick question. Like, how many of you found that you need some support, guidance, and co-selling with AWS, um, to get your co-selling strategy, how, how to define the co-selling strategy? Show of hands, All right, this is good. So, we're going to speak about just that today, um, and we'll get started. So across 1,000+ interactions that I've had with partners and our AWS sales teams, there are some themes that really stick out time and time again, and it's typically what do partners want from us or what do they need consistently. The number one thing I hear is partners want to be found, right? You want your customers to find you and you want our AWS sales to recognize you, and that's something we hear across AWS regions. Industries use cases that's something that all partners are are vying to do. How do I present myself to your sales teams? The other thing is to be trusted by your customers and by the power of that your solutions or how you go to market and that's something that is extremely important to our sales teams to understand but is also a monumental challenge because we have so many amazing solutions out there. And then the last one of his is to be chosen, and what I mean by that is when is the AWS sales team gonna pull me in for that next customer sales and engage me early on so we can go together as one team and these are three themes that we hear consistently and it's important, but we also have another problem that we have to overcome, which is our scale, which is a great problem for someone like me and my team to have. We're at that point this year where we've transacted over 1 million opportunities with partners like yourself, and that's tremendous, but that's also presenting some challenges that are pretty significant because we cannot be in every single opportunity every single time. And you partners have built a lot of solutions out there that you want to deliver to your customers. We have over 30,000 solutions that are listed across both Marketplace and Partner Central, and it's impossible for all of our sales teams to know every single one of them. So we really need to take this and convert it into something to a future of coal that is powered not just by humans but by data, by insights, and by AI. And so Akshare. Do you want to tell them what we have? Yeah, to help solve exactly that problem. Yeah, uh, she'll be, you covered and you got to the heart of the problem there, which is that the scale that we have, uh, it's almost humanly impossible to get to all the information that partners give us and find what's the right partner to solve a customer opportunity. So, today what we're going to speak about is This message, which is that your data is your go to market. And how you do that, we look at how rich data, structured data, and complete data helps you. Get to the right customers and connects you to the right customer opportunities. We look at discoverability. We look at how scoring and prioritization capabilities that we have help you focus your energy on the right customers first so that you're you're focusing on the right place and also how we improve relevance in finding the right customer and the partner. OK, so we look at 3 specific use cases today. The first one is um partner matching, finding the right partner to the right customer. We look at scoring and prioritization, how we are using AI to give you insights on where to focus. And then we look at automated validation that we're doing at scale using AI. OK. Um, the first one is AI powered uh matching. So, what we do, uh, internally at AWS is, is that we have a partner matching engine, uh, that recommends partners for opportunities. It's an ML powered recommendation engine that matches customer opportunities to partners. Uh, at the right time and, um, at, and making sure that the partners are set up for success and have the right information. So what, what we do is we surface information about the partner, like how's the partner doing? What kind of uh competencies does the partner have, um, what kind of success, uh, metrics of the partner uh shown over the last uh few months, years, uh, in the past in general, and like. The way the engine works is that it looks at the customer's opportunity. It looks at what region is the customer coming from, what segment are they working on, what use case are they going after, and then looks at the partner who has the capability to solve those problems. And how it does that is looking at the specializations that partner has. It looks at the AWS certifications that you might have, and that indicates the capability that a partner might be able to solve that problem for a specific. And the most important is past wins. So what are the deals that the partner has won in the same region, segment, industry combinations to ensure that you, you have those credibility markers and surface those to the sellers. And AWS sellers are then empowered to make the choice on the right partner to choose for engaging on an opportunity. This is how you get AWS referrals from um AWS. Um, what we've seen, um, when I, when I tell the story to most partners, they, they, they're sometimes skeptical, it typically works on relationships, uh, but this year we've had nearly a third of our opportunities that go to our partners, uh, go through the partner matching engine. And what that, what that means is we're removing that element where uh it's no longer about who you know at AWS. It's about your data, and, and the insights that you're able to give uh to surface to the AWS sellers to find the partnership. So, so this is about partner matching engine, the first use case. And I'll come back to what you can do about it later on. Let's look at a 2nd use case, which is scoring and prioritization. So, Um While we do the matching, uh, what we also do is, uh, show a reflection of how you're performing in the recommendation, using a coastal recommendation score. So this score is currently available for all ACE eligible partners on partner analytics within AWS Partner Central. And you can see how you're performing against your peer group in your in the regions, in different industries, in different segments. And what that allows you to do is focus and track your performance and invest in building your niche, where you can be successful, where you can be differentiated um with, um, with respect to other partners. Then the second piece that we have for the partners is on opportunities where where the customer is likely to purchase or procure on AWS Marketplace. We surface something called the AWS Marketplace Engagement score. The score indicates the propensity to buy for a customer on AWS Marketplace. What this unlocks for you is you can then build a whole new go to market strategy using AWS Marketplace and know from your existing pipeline, who are the customers who are likely to purchase on AWS Marketplace and go to market with those customers. And this basically unlocks a whole new revenue stream for your business. Finally, um, uh, to talk about how we're using AI with validation should be, do you want to take over and talk about validation? So Aksha is focused a lot on your data and a lot of scoring or insights, um, that blends with information we have, but we're looking at wholesale end to end, right? And we want to focus on getting you. To the customer outcome that you want to drive quickly and so we're looking at our entire sales process and we're investing in building more AI, more automation, more agentic solutions where we think that we can get you quickly across in the sales pipeline. There's one that already happens on your ACE opportunities when you submit an opportunity, uh, there's a validation check that happens to ensure that the opportunity itself is qualified before we pass it on to our sales team. We've had tremendous progress on that. We have a lot of AI that's driving that validation this year alone we've had 90% of the validation all driven through AI and we'll continue to invest. Tools like that, but we're also investing in things like validating your solutions and something that takes a long time to shorten that cycle so you can get to your competency faster, right, those designations which are important to you, to your customers to give you those credentials quickly so we can get you through solution validation so your competency validations quickly. One amazing use case where we're fully agentic is our own Gen AI competency is completely validated through Agentic Solutions and so we're ensuring anyone who's interested in pursuing that we, we're able to validate your competency, give you your credentials quickly so you can get to market and start that coce engine in that funnel quickly so these. These are things that we're putting together from a process standpoint as well from the data and insights standpoint to sort of package this up to optimize coal for you guys but also for our sales team so they can prioritize opportunities where you need to go to market together with them quickly in an expedient manner because that's exactly what our customers want. They want a fast response from us as well as from you guys. But don't let me just tell you that. Why don't we hear from one of our partners? Um, so Cloud Zero is a partner which, um, in their last quarter got their biggest deal through the partner matching recommendation engine that Akshay was talking about. Came as a complete surprise to them because they were not investing any of their go to market strategy with particularly that customer account team. Nor were they focusing on that particular customer solution for that particular industry, but our tools and our models were able to pick out this partner because of other implementations they've done for particularly that solution in other regions similar. Our customers and recommended this to our sales team and they were able to get without investing in the pre-sales activity that most people would do in traditional sales cycles and get their biggest opportunity through our recommendation engine so we're seeing this come to life. But this is not just about one such instance we want it to be repeatable and we want it to be consistent and for that we have another example where a partner has truly invested in understanding what we're building and positioning their portfolio in a way that maximizes this opportunity ahead of them. So Rackspace spent a lot of time with the AWS team to really look at their catalog of solutions that they have. Align it with their competencies, their designations, and put together a go to market strategy that aligns with which of these they actually want to take to market versus a more universal spray strategy, and then they looked at their pipeline and started getting better at the data on their pipeline. And this took a while, this took a couple of quarters, but they were able to work with us consistently in a repeatable manner, and they've seen a 72% increase in their wholesale growth just in this year. And so we're seeing these results happen where partners are being intentional and strategic about where they're investing and using the data that they're sending to us to actually drive these outcomes. But, again, this is just a couple of examples. Akshay. What's the secret sauce of being able to do this in a repeatable fashion? Absolutely. So I'm, I'm sure you're all asking, how do we replicate the same kind of success that Cloud Zero and Rackspace, uh, just had? And uh the reality is it's all in your data, and I'm going to come back to that. What you can do as partners to control how you get visibility within AWS and to customers first. Invest in high quality solutions, uh, build your listings and partner central solutions to describe what is your ideal customer profile, what kind of workloads are you supporting, what use cases are you specializing in? What is your niche that differentiates you from other cus other, other partners? Second, Gain specializations and AWS certifications. These are indicators that are credibility markers of your capability to be able to support a customer and serve as a customer opportunity. Finally, and this is, this is probably the most important out of, out of the three, which is keeping accurate and most up to-date ACE pipeline. And what, what that means is descriptive titles, more uh detailed customer business problems, um, updates on what the next steps are an opportunity, keeping the stages of the opportunity up to date, and so on. What we've seen our most successful partners do is integrate their CRM directly with AWS using our AWS uh using the CRM integration capabilities that we have. Um, we, we just launched a number of new APIs that allow you to connect your CRMs directly with AWS. Um, we also have our first party and third party connectors that are available for partners to use to remove the overheads in maintaining pipelines in. Two different systems. So you work out of your own system, and then that automatically updates um Ace opportunities. And, and when partners do that, we've seen over 55% improvement in their recommendation uh visibility to our sellers. Finally, I think the key point here is, whenever a partner is looking to be found, to be discovered, and to be chosen, it all goes back to the data that that you provide AWS so that we can use that to help our AI find the right customer problem that you can support. And I'm going to take, keep that, that one single takeaway from this session, which is that your data is your go to market advantage. And we are using AI to amplify that advantage for you. Um, if you have to win more, invest in data quality. Gain more visibility, win more deals. All right. So, The top question that I hear from partners is, is this documented somewhere? Is this available for you to look up anywhere? Uh, so we just released a blog, uh, two months back. Uh, it's about how to improve your visibility to AWS sales. Uh, the QR code takes you directly to the blog. And because you're here and you're interested in AI powered core selling, you may also be interested in two other talks, PEC 107 and PEX 113. Both are happening on Thursday. Um, uh, a lot of new features are going to be announced there and so on. So if you're interested, do join those sessions. Thank you, thank you for joining us.
