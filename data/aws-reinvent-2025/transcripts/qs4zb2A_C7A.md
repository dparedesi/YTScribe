Good morning, everyone. Welcome to AWS Reinvent. I'm Andre Bajera, managing director from Accenture. It's a real pleasure to be here with my colleagues from Illumia and Accenture, Daniel, Salvador, and Gustavo. Today we show you how Illumia and Accenture partner with AWS to reinvent customer service across 11 countries. But before dive into the solution, let's take a quick look at Illumia. The company at the heart of reinvention. And to kick things off, I'll hand it to Daniel Figuerido, the CEO and the founder of Illumia. Thank you very much. For me it's a real pleasure to be here. Thank you, Andre, for this, this introduction and, and, uh, to have the chance to work so many times during my career together. Yeah, you do something wrong in your previous life. I, I don't know. My name is Daniel Figueido. I am the CEO and and founder of Illumia. Uh, my last name is quite unpronounced, so everybody is saying me Danny or figure, yeah, um, and you know, when, when, when I arrived here I, I look very familiar faces. Yeah, I have friends, uh, in different parts of the world, so I am glad to be you here. So let me, let me start with how many of you are coming from Latin America? Raise your hands. Good. So inenvenidos Bembinddos, yeah, thank you for being here. Uh, let me try to introduce Illumia and, and Grupo Huerte. Grupo Huerte is a private, um, economic group in in in Latin America is an Argentine group that started business in many industries, uh, media tech, insurance. Banking, IT, agribusiness, uh, and, and constructions and probably others that I don't remember and also in terms of IT, so we are part of Grupote Illumia born as a result of the impact of digitalization. The impact of G AI, the disruption that Gen AI is creating in everything that we are doing, yeah, so there is a strong need of efficiency and strong need of treating, you know, customers in many of the companies that we manage, uh, and we needed to do this right. And, and let me tell you one thing we try many times for doing projects for doing transformation, uh, to do and to implement Gen AI in our, uh, business process at scale, uh, is not transformation. It's reinvent as Amazon is saying, or kind of revolution. That's why we created the Lumia, um, what we do. And what we offer to the market, uh, 3 things customer service as a, uh, customer care as a service or customer journeys as a service, uh, automation as a service, and, and also, uh, smart tech solutions campaigns, uh, how to manage and to monetize data, uh, in, in the different companies and the different clients that we are managing, uh, and obviously business transformation outsourcing in, in 2002. A group of work uh bought from, uh, from AT&T, DirecTV, and Sky. Sky is the, is the, the name that DirecTV is used in Brazil, uh, and from that on we started a very huge transformation and very, very huge process of. Uh, you know, getting efficient and transforming the company and Illumia was a, a key player on, on, on, on that transformation. Uh, DirecTV in Latin America is operating 12 different countries, the entire Latin America, uh, the Caribbean, and also Puerto Rico. So as a context because you probably listen to Grupo Huerte, to Illumia, to many different things, and it's important to put some context on, on where, on who we are. And let me, let me try to put some challenges that we faced, and not necessarily the ones that you are facing, but we face those, yeah, we, we, we talk and we get promises around digital first for customer care for many years and how many of you listen the same things and at the end is still cus is still contact center yeah? Raise your hands how many? How many is our challenge, yeah? Second, you know, customer data, we have data lakes. We have data all over the places, uh, and it's a nightmare, a really nightmare how to deal with this and, more important, how to, uh, monetize, uh, data at the time that we want to provide a better service to our companies, a better services to our clients. Raise your hands who are, are facing the same problem, yeah. OK. Very huge problem and, and, and the last one and not less important, uh, everybody in Latin America is doing MVPs, pokes and and many uh tries in order to use NAI in their processes and at the end of the day, uh, how to measure and and how to identify results are not sudden it's not so evident, yeah, the issue of tokenization. And how to consume different platforms sometimes is diluting or and in some points the the efficiency is not relevant yeah so those are the changes uh that that we faced, uh, probably are the changes that many of you are are are facing, uh, in your, in your companies, uh, and we started from this from this challenges yeah. Uh, what we are doing at ILumia, if we need to define, uh, obviously technology is what we are investing in and what we are managing, but at the end we are not selling technology. Yeah, we are selling outcomes. We are selling what we call a service as a software. We are selling our, our, our clients and our companies, uh, that we are, uh, intensive use. We are, we are doing intensive use of technology, but at the end we are not trying to charge or to or to transfer that technology to anybody. We are. Selling business outcomes, yeah, and we have, we have models of pricing and, and the way that we operate and deliver the services, uh, and we build that based on specific outcomes, yeah, transactions or the driver this that are, uh, you know, linking the results with the business case that our clients are producing. So this is what we are doing, uh, the idea, uh, today is to present some of the cases that we are managing and, and how we are dealing with all these, um, is all this, uh, challenges in, in Latin America and in other places. We are working with an ecosystems of strategic partners. We cannot do this alone, yeah, obviously Amazon is a strategic partner Accenture that is hosting, uh, this, uh. This session is a strategic partner, but we have others, yeah, we have nice, uh, we have ESPs in Latin America because we are offering end to end solutions, uh, for our, for our clients. So this is Illumia. We are going right now to, uh, move into, uh, how we are managing this and how we are delivering what I, what I, uh, I am presenting today. Hello everyone, I'm Lumi, the AI agent from Illumia. Illumia was born with a clear purpose in partnership with Accenture and AWS to transform how companies connect with their customers, where empathy, agility, and intelligence coexist seamlessly. Let me share a bit more about how our business model works. But first, a few numbers that speak for themselves. According to market benchmarks, companies that adopted generative AI and customer service have reduced operational costs by up to 40%, increased first contact resolution by up to 70%, boosted conversion rates through data monetization by up to 50%, and improved NPA. by as much as 25 points. Alumia delivers what few traditional organizations can customer care that is empathetic, efficient, scalable, and secure. We offer flexible commercial models, including outcome-based engagements, business aligned pricing, and even the integration of internal or third-party teams under an outsourcing model. Thank you for allowing me to share a glimpse of Alumia with you. See you soon. Thank you Lumi for the introduction. I will pass this to Salvador Alvarez. Salvador Alvarez is the chief commercial officer of Alumia, also a great friend, and he will continue to explain the how we deliver these these challenges. Excellent. Well, thank you very much and thanks everybody for this. So as Daniel said, you know, we have been, you know, working for years, you know, in this industry, you know, talking with different customers in the region. And we always find the same answer, you know, when it comes to AI, you know, it's sometimes it's failing to deliver the promise, you know, of operational efficiencies. We don't have many companies that actually are trying to build solutions, micro solutions, mega solutions, big and bloated, you know, chat box that you see everywhere, but sometimes it really fails to, to really drive, you know, what the customer really needs. Also, every one of us who works in a large enterprise, you know, have plenty of squads, you know, working and testing, you know, different agents in order to make sense. And, and to be the FOMO, not the fear of missing out. There's something there that actually we need to explore, but sometimes we are not sure how to do it. So what we have done in Illumia is, is take a different approach. And we start with the business. So we sit down with the business. Our stakeholders are the CEOs, CMOs, COOs, CFOs. And we talk about customer care because that's our specialization. So we're purely a company that drives the service, customer care with deep domain knowledge of it. A software, using a platform that actually we built together with AWS and Accenture. So we not only have A very skilled technical technical team that actually do deliver the solutions, but you also have an excellent team when it comes to customer care. Our leaders are ex-CMOs, you know, leading the operations for large organizations across the regions, but that's really important. That's a big differentiator we start with the business. We start with the outcome. We empower ourselves with a platform fueled by AI. But as you all know, AI is not the answer for everything that actually we need. Sometimes we need automation tools. Sometimes we just need to redefine how the processes work. And this allows us to take some risks when it comes to our engagement with our customers, so we start with the business case. And we commit to the business case. We make sure that actually we simplify the implementation of the technology. We simplify the charging model as Daniel says, you know, we don't use tokenization model that actually becomes, you know, a system that actually is very unpredictable when it comes to cost. Actually, we consolidate that in the analysis that actually we do. And we have a fixed cost that actually helps the customer. To take from the fixed cost statement to a variable model in a very predictable manner. So, we try to drive all the benefits of AI to the outcome of the business. So today we're going to see some of those demos of how we do it. We're going to have also uh a technical explanation, you know, for those that are more than the technical side of what they need to know to do this and how we do it. Conversations are key for us. Uh, so we engage not only in the first engagement, you know, when, when, when, when an entry is out with a customer, you know, for example, comes to our organizations, it doesn't really matter if it's voice, if it's text, if it's another API. We put a lot of effort in creating models, voices, and connections that are very empathetic. Because this is a journey for all of us. It's a journey that actually we, we all transit to say, you know, how do I move, you know, for a traditional conversation and engagement with an organization for products and services. And now how do we move in this new model? Not only for our interactions with the, with the, with all the agents, but also agent to agent, agent to traditional models that actually we need it. So those conversations are not only on the first um line of, of sight that is actually, you know, how do I take the conversation, we also take the customer journey. What else, what happens behind the scenes in order for that to happen? So we have to redesign those customer journeys. We work with our customers, trying to redefine them in order to make it more efficient. Using the knowledge that actually we have. And if you use a platform that is not intrusive. We believe in non-intrusive platforms. We don't require the customers to change anything, but actually they do. We have to orchestrate. We have to create that ecosystems that actually integrate not only the agents that actually we can bring forward in order to do the things that actually we need to do. But also to reuse and maximize the use of APIs, agents, ERPs or systems that actually the the the the customers may may have. And finally we engage with people, how we empower them, how we make the system, how we contextualize the business. So those interactions becomes human agents. It's a hybrid model that actually we need to do when we engage with with people as well, we can commit to the end to end operational efficiency cost. And this has been very well received by our customers. I have, you know, the firsthand experience every time I go there, I say like, listen, I'm not here to sell you technology. I'm not seeing, not here saying you a license or a platform. I will work with you on outcomes. And that's a surprise At least in in Latin America, it's a model that actually not all the companies are challenges are willing to take. Instead of being a PPT or PowerPoint presentations, you know, with all the promises, all the things that actually we are going to do are going to make if you, if you hire us, we say, we trust our skill. We trust our platforms, and we're going to commit to do it. So we guarantee the results when it comes to operational efficiencies. If something costs 100, we say it will cost 80, it will cost 80. And it's our responsibility. As a company that actually hurts about, you know, domain knowledge to deliver it. Omnichannel Maybe a conversation start in one channel, but maybe it's not the most efficient for it to resolve it. For example, Roadside assistance. You may receive a call because you need some support for your car. But actually, you need to geolocalization services and maybe on the phone it's not easy to get it. So let's do a parallel connection with them. Let's open uh an SMS or a WhatsApp, so we can interact in, in multiple channels at the same time. That's really important in order to orchestrate, you know, those communications in a multi in multi-channel environment and maybe switching them if it's possible. So the conversations last a matter, you know, within the platform. That means that the model of the super app is a model that actually we keep challenging. We all love to have super apps. Oh, I want my customer to install the apps, you know, for my company. But that's not scalable. If you think about, you know, the amount of services and products that actually you consume, how many apps you know you need in your phone? So we're moving a pure hygenic model. What it means is that if I use interfaces like, for example, Anthropic, whilst I'm driving, and I need to book, I don't know, a table in a restaurant. And maybe that restaurant, you know, doesn't have an agent or an API. I may use an agent to go to that website. And do the work for you. Connected genic model to the more traditional model. Or maybe, I don't know, you want to um open a complaint in a company that actually has a website. I will use an agent to go through that website and do the complaint for you. So, we understand the interfaces and we interact with the interfaces. We try to make it simpler. So not always think about that incoming, you know, message that actually you heard. But this is ecosystem that actually comes and goes. So in our vision, I don't know if we're gonna need websites in the future. Why? It may be an interface of the past of the past. We can do an API. We can do an agent to agent. Even we can have an agent that actually goes through an IVR, makes a call, navigates through the IVR. And have a conversation with an agent. It's an intermediate steps of where we're going. In whichever state you are. Our platform supports it, and that's really important for us. Apathetic agentic model in order to do that. We do an architecture of microagents. White label in microags like Lego blocks, but actually you can put together. We can create some of them together. We create some of with the customers. And we paralyze them in every interaction, we may have 4567 agents listening to that channel, to that conversation. The model that actually you build an agent that actually you keep, you know, expanding it with more knowledge, actually doesn't work. We try it. Probably you tried before. What happens is you train it in one way, then you try to adjust it, and somehow start hallucinating. So the models microagents in parallel specialize them, it works much better. That means I can have an agent that actually is monitoring the sentiment of the goal. If I'm complaining, I may have an agent that actually, you know, specializes in retention. Or specializing in app and cross-selling. And we need to be able to move those agents on the fly because the conversation may go in another direction. So we keep choosing which is the right agent in that moment of the conversation. It's like having different parts of your brain trying to compete with one agent that coordinates that. We're going to see some of the demos that actually we do that. But that's really important for us in order to make sure that actually we can engage in an empathetic model. And Danny mentioned, you know, a powerful Martech solution. If we keep tracking of those conversations, we remember those conversations, we know what you're doing. We can create campaigns with agents that actually analyze your data. Analyze your promotions, your products, services, and based on all those engagements. We can embed These up and cross agents in the model that actually will navigate through all those conversations, all those interactions, and be activated on the fly. So, for example, if you are engaging in, in a roadside accident, maybe, I don't know, I, I, I, it will be an opportunity, you know, to sell you um an add-on in the insurance. So we sent all these agents to hunt for the opportunity. And that's why we see the future also for market solution. With that, we always try the zero A or zero load in human interactions in order to make sure that actually we achieve those outcomes. Uh, that actually we commit at the beginning. So for, for us, It's all about the software. How do we deliver service as software, non-intrusive. Open Integrating multiple technologies. Integrated the systems and the investment that actually the customers have done, a micro-agent architecture. A two-way system in order to communicate and integrate agentic walls with traditional walls. And monetizing the channel at the same time. That's customer that's customer value. Empowered by AI. So with that, let me just show you some of the demonstrations that actually we have. Thank you. OK. Yeah, just like Salvador said, uh, we're gonna see some of the demos and uh how this multi-agent architecture work a little bit under the hood, so let's jump right to it. OK, it's the first one. Hello Daniel, thank you for contacting Alumia. My name is Luna. How can I help you today? Just a quick reminder, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. Thanks for the reminder, Luna, but actually, I'm not really happy with my direct view service. I'd like to cancel it, please. I understand completely, and I'm sorry to hear you're thinking of leaving us. I see you've been a customer for 3 years and have the premium package, which includes sports, movies, and series channels, correct? What has changed in your TV usage recently? Well, actually, I'm watching a lot more streaming than I than what I used to do before. So we can see the different agents interacting. So like uh, he said, the account manager, sent me an analyst. I completely understand. Many customers have told us the same thing. The good news is that we have more flexible options that might fit your current needs better, keeping what you enjoy most. Tell me, do you still watch sports channels or do you use news programming a lot? Well, yeah, actually, I do watch a lot of sports and news, uh, a couple, sometimes I do. Perfect. I have a proposal that might interest you. Since you've been a loyal customer for 3 years, I can offer you the Essential Plus package, which keeps all sports and news channels for only $89.90 per month. This represents a saving of $39 monthly. Additionally, I can apply a special loyalty discount of 20% for the next 6 months, which would make the value $71.92. What do you think? Yeah, that sounds good actually. Uh, let's go with that then. It makes sense for me. Excellent choice. I'm very happy to keep you with us on a plan that makes more sense for you. I'll process the change now. The new Essential Plus package with a loyalty discount will be activated immediately, and you'll see the value of $71.92 on your next bill due on December 15th. I'll send you a confirmation email at customer@gmail.com with all the details of the change and the list of available channels. Is that email correct? Oh, that's an example, uh, of course, a pretty easy customer, right? Not, not all the customers will accept an offer like that. But just to highlight, you know, the multi-agents and how they work together in the, in the master kind of decides what to answer back to the customer. And this is like an app we try to, uh, we did the video, so we, we thought about doing the live demo, but we were concerned that it might not work, uh, on the setup here, we didn't know how it worked. So that's the first example. The churn, very, uh, big problem for, um, for some of these TV companies, and then we're gonna see the second one, last one, yeah. So there is, there is some delays, you know, in the response just, just to show you. So we're going to show another demo of how it works in real time in conversation that actually we record live. Hello, Daniel. Thank you for contacting Alumia. My name is Luanna. How may I help you today? Hi, Luna, can you check whether my bill is correct, please? I can certainly check that for you right away. I already have your details loaded. I'm accessing your billing history here. Looking at this, the average value of your last TV package bills was around $189.90 but this month it came to $259.90. Correct? That is correct. So why the sharp rise in cost? Perfect. I understand your dissatisfaction, and I will explain how we will proceed. I will register a dispute in confidence, meaning the credit for the difference will be applied to your next bill, so you are not disadvantaged while we conduct the analysis. During this process, our billing team will review the case in detail. If the dispute is valid, the credit will be permanently maintained. If it is invalid, meaning if we identify that the amount charged was correct, the credit will be reversed in the following bill. OK, please proceed with that then, please, Luna. Perfect. I have already registered the dispute under number CL 9458723. The credit of $70 will be automatically applied to your next bill, and the analysis result will be sent via email within 10 business days. And just a quick reminder, what happens in Vegas stays, wait a minute. Share it with everyone. OK, um, yeah, just a little joke. Uh, this, the avatar, of course, uh, we're still, uh, thinking about it as a separate channel. It's not very cheap, so you have to really think about, you know, where to use it and, you know, how to use it, uh, for the best of your business case, but it's, it's, it's a possibility. The back end is the same for voice, for text, or even for the avatar. It's all the same, uh, and it, you, you can choose how to use it. So we're trying with a customer that actually wants to do a video conferencing. So video conferencing services with Avatar, you know, it's something possible that actually you can do, if, if, if, if there is a need, you know, custom breaker for us it's, it's, it's all the same, you know, it's how you deliver the message in that matter. That's right. Um, yeah, and now we're gonna see a little bit more of the solution and a little bit what's uh under the hood, as I said. Hello again. I want to present to you the next gen operating model and architecture for the customer service transformation in Alumia, powered by generative AI and agentic experience, a model that completely redefines how customers interact, how agents perform, and how organizations learn from every single conversation. At the core, a living architecture that connecting people, data, and decisions in real time. Let's explore it layer by layer. At the top, we have the control tower. This is where everything comes together. Operations are orchestrated, performance is monitored, and strategies are adjusted dynamically. It's the strategic brain that ensures every part of the ecosystem works in harmony, optimizing experience, cost, and efficiency. Next, we have the text, digital and voice channels, the front door of the experience. Here live the AI agents that engage customers across web, app, chat, and IVR. Each channel has its own tone, personality, and context awareness, yet all of them connect to the same intelligent core. That core is the Gen AI engine, the brain. This is where the intelligence truly happens. A multi-agent orchestrator manages specialized models, LLMs, SLMs integrated with the knowledge base, AI. Content curation and the customer interaction database. Every insight, every response, every decision is powered by real data and continuous learning. This engine doesn't just answer, it thinks, predicts, and evolves. This is the micro agents layer, where intelligence becomes modular. Each microagent is a specialist AI built to solve complex challenges from diagnostics to prediction. They're reusable, composable, and scalable, turning every new use case into an asset of intelligence. While customers are served by AI agents, human agents work side by side with their co-pilot. A single intelligent screen that provides recommendations, automates actions, and anticipates the next best move. Here, human intuition and artificial intelligence operate as one. All information flows into the data insights hub. This is where data becomes knowledge. Every customer interaction feeds analytics, understanding patterns, resolution times, satisfaction drivers. And finally, at the foundation, the process optimization lab. Here, intelligence turns into action, inefficiencies are identified, processes are redesigned, and new automations are deployed. It's where the system learns from itself, and the cycle of improvement never stops. Together, these layers form a self-learning ecosystem, an architecture where every conversation, every agent, and every insight contributes to a smarter, faster, and more human customer experience. OK, yeah, so, uh, one of the many important, uh, parts of the architecture that we need actually to serve is, uh, when you think about customer care, there are a lot of spikes in the demand, so you're a constant, uh, and then a constant demand and then for example there's like an important. Game for for DirecTV and the spike on usage is like crazy so we we we tried to use as most as we could uh serverless components uh very few exceptions for the telephony part uh apart from that apart from that, everything else is serverless and just a curiosity, on the first week that we went into production there was like uh I think it was a Thursday where they had uh a lot of uh games of the national teams in Latin America, Brazil, Argentina, everything. And uh we, we just basically hit the max that we had 3 times over at 9 o'clock at night. It was crazy and we were able to uh using of course AWS surveillance components to support that spike. We're just going to see one more call and then a little more of the components. Hello, good afternoon. I'm your DirecTV virtual assistant. Who am I speaking with? Very good morning, I'm Mark Smith. Hi, Mr. Smith, pleasure to meet you. Um, I saw that you requested a copy of your bill. Is that what you need? I was waiting for the bill and it still hasn't arrived. Can you send me a copy? Sure, I'm going to sort this out right now. Let me look up the information for you. Perfect. I found your account and confirmed that you have the electronic bill service activated. The bills are sent to the registered email that starts with the letters MS and ends with at gmail.com. Is that email correct? Yes. Perfect. I'm sending your bill to your registered email right now. One moment. Done. I've sent it. You should receive the bill in your inbox in the next few minutes. Is everything all right? Yes, perfect, thanks. Great. Remember that from me DirecTV you can download previous bills if you need them. Is there anything else I can help you with? No, everything's perfect. Thank you very much for your help. It was a pleasure to assist you. Have an excellent day. OK, um, so, uh, as I said, it's, it's mostly based on serverless components. Uh, our main, main database, it's OpenSearch, and that's, uh, using that and Reddis. That's how we transfer contacts from one channel to another to support true omni-channel. So since the the behind the scenes the brain is the same. So if you're a voice in the IVR, for example, and you go to a text channel, the context completely transferred to the text channels. It just keeps talking to you on the text as if you were talking on the IVR in the first place. And that's uh OpenSearch to help with that. We use Amazon Transcribe as a speech to text. I'm very happy with that. Our main component is the Amazon Bedrock, um, uh, which gave us a lot of flexibility to change the, the LLMs. So we, we started with one and then uh we already have, uh, we're using 4 different ones and we keep looking and seeing what's coming. Um, to, uh, you know, to use the best, what's the, what's works best, uh, for that specific agent, right, uh, for the voice, uh, most of the voice that we heard actually are from 11 labs, so, uh, the text to speech, uh, startup, um, we also use, uh, as our, uh, for our, our rag, uh, the knowledge base from Bedrock as well, and, uh, for the orchestration of the agents we use Verso AI, so the open source, um. Using Node and Yeah, the guard rails they're also in the in the WS we implemented them, um, and this is just to show part of the some of the LLMs that we use. So for a faster, simpler, and quicker response, we use Amazon Nova, mostly Nova Light. Uh, we use a lot of anthropic, so we use Sonnet 4, Sonnet 4.5, and the Haiku 4.5, which is the fastest one, just came out about a month ago. Uh, so we actually, we're constantly on the lookout for, you know, whatever's coming and to see whatever works best for us and of course cost is also something that we keep looking and trying to see what's the best that works best for that use case, OK. Um, yeah, I'm just gonna go to the next one and pass it down back to Daniel, talk about the results. OK, thank you, Gustavo. Uh, let me talk about results, yeah, and. First of all, let me talk about DIRECTV because we make a huge transformation. When we started the transformation, we used to have thousands of CSRs around Latin America unionized in different countries, uh, with more than 10 years working as a CSR, yeah, so we had a very, very challenging situation at the beginning. Uh, in rewriting the customer interaction, the, the reinvent or the revolution that I mentioned, uh, 1st 12 months of implementing, uh, the, the, the first pieces of our solution, uh, we decrease the total cost of ownership in 25%. Yeah, we are aiming to have, uh, 45% reduction on on TCO during the length of the entire program. So when we Lumi talk about the our aspirations and results we are getting the results right now, yeah. Um, something that that it was very important for the business that DirecTV and Sky is managing registrations, yeah, how the, how the, the customers are, are being registered in, in, in our systems when we implemented the solution, uh, in the first weeks, uh, we increased 3 times the the success on the registration. When we talk about how much we resolve in the 1st 4 weeks, we increased that to 84%. So these are results that matter. We are not talking about aspirations. We are talking about real results that we are facing. And uh you know when we talk about Gen AI we talk about uh you know in some cases hallucinations, yeah, we filter 97% of the interactions without zero hallucinations we still have 3% that we need challenges and challenges during the operational side that we need to continue to work on, on, on that dimension. And obviously something that is not we cannot decline even though we we want to get deficiencies and reduce the the total cost of ownership uh MPS is very important yeah we had uh a customers that were very frustrated in in the way that they interact with us and we are improving that vis a visa we deliver the use cases into the new, the new paradigm. Um, and, and, you know, let me, let me talk about, uh, two or three things that for me is important and I will ask also Salva to, to join me on that what we are doing right now. Commercial expansions we are expanding our portfolio of clients. So can we comment on what we are doing in terms of commercial expansion in, in, in our different markets? Actually we are serving already 10 million customers, you know, so we have a client zero that actually is one of the largest tech medias, you know, in the region. That means that actually, you know, um, it's a proven platform, uh, is something that actually we are expanding and talking about customers in, in all Latin America. Uh, indeed yesterday, you know, we have a meeting with, with the AWS team as well, and they ask us when we're going to America, to the US, um, and it's mainly because, um, the purpose isn't it? This is applied technology. If, if you think about, you know, where everything is going, you know, the other day, you know, the Blackstone, you know, CEO was talking about, you know, where to invest, and says it's rule-based companies that actually have the main expertise supported with a large ecosystem, um, you know, working with technical partners that actually what we're doing in order to expand it. So, um, all over Latin America at this stage we are only 18 months old, you know, as a company but with, um, big dreams and big ambitions. Thank you, Salva. Uh, another two or three things that would like to, to comment with you other than the, you know, the, the technical side, the demonstrations, and, and what we are doing, uh, what we expect on our people. We are working very hard, you know. We have not only a huge expertise in terms of how to deal with GI at scale, but we also have a, a huge, huge expertise in terms of operational, uh, operational processes, and we expect three things. I, I continue to mention this, uh, you know, in, in different places when we talk about my people in, in the region. I expect people with passion. I expect people with ambition. And great souls, yeah, I, I don't expect any, any more and any less of that, uh, and I think we are building a team, uh, on, on that direction and on the other side we are building a team of, of partners, you know. And and we our partners become our friends because we we work so close with them that sometimes we are not seeing who is in in which company yeah so this is very important and and this is for us a a precondition on what we are doing. Um, and, and we don't want to do only this, uh, we are working right now in Latin America. Sometimes the other day a person approached me and, and, and he said, uh, are you planning to stay in Latin America only? No, we're not planning to stay in Latin America only. We want to keep our focus in order to uh expand our company in in such a way that we can manage. Salva is is managing you know the expansion uh in a very uh you know uh in a in a way that we are focusing on on deliver results in increasing the number of clients and this is very important for us, yeah. Um, and, and just for closing, and then I will open to, to questions and comments. I, I, I would like from you not only questions on what we are doing. I would like to understand your visions and your comments on that because obviously all of you are, are, are having similar cha challenges in, in your companies, but we have a purpose, yeah, uh, we obviously we, we are a company we want to. Gain money we want to expand our, our, our footprint and we want to, uh, you know, deliver what we promise, um, but if you look into into uh into our logo we are Illumia, yeah, we are empathy meets AI. We want to be the co-pilots of human beings at the time that they interact and not. Navigate the different ecosystems, uh, that they use for living, uh, and, and, and the different experiences that they that they are managing. This is our purpose we are there we would like to innovate. We are not trying to, to be the, the, the ones imagining, uh, how much, uh, the Gen AI or the, uh, artificial intelligence will impact, uh, our business. We are, we are ready to surf the, the wave, uh, and, and how to deliver that and, and scale, uh, into our business processes, uh, so this is where we are. Thank you for the patience and to listen to us, and I will open the stage for, for questions and comments. I want to receive also your comments. Yeah, thank you. Thank you very much, you know, for your attention. Thank you very much. Thank you.
