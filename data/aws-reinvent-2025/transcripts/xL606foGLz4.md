People were able to make it here, uh, and didn't get, uh, called at the blackjack tables downstairs. So thank you for coming to this at 5:30 on Tuesday. Um, I hope we have a lot of people that are passionate about operations in the room. I know I am. Uh, I got a couple questions for the audience before I get started. Uh, raise your hands if you've ever been woken up in the middle of the night for an operational outage. Yeah, yeah, OK, we got a couple ops people in the room that's good to see and uh raise them one more time if you, if that outage took more than 2 hours to resolve. OK. Uh, and last question I promise, uh, raise your hands if during that event. If, if you struggle to get the right people on the call to resolve the issue. Yeah, yeah, OK. So I'm Jason Bauer, uh, I'm the director of our AWS, uh, field support organization. Over the last 15 years, I've worked with some of the world's largest enterprises, helping them build, deploy, and operate workloads on AWS. I've been in some of those 2 a.m. war rooms. I've seen the cascading impact of failures, and I've witnessed the transformation that is possible when we get operations right. I'm sure you've seen the quote from Werner before. Everything fails all the time. But failure has real cost. According to a recent Splunk research article that I read. Outages now cost the global 2000 set of enterprises over $400 billion annually, and that's not just a number in a spreadsheet, $400 billion. That represents 9% of the average company's profits disappearing due to operational events. But here's what's even more concerning. Organizations are facing an average of 29 unplanned operational events a year, with each incident taking over 5 hours to resolve and costing $13.5 million on average. Let me paint a picture that I think's gonna sound familiar to you. You're running a mission critical application on AWS across multiple services, probably multiple availability zones, maybe multiple regions. With complex dependencies when something goes wrong. And it will, and when it does, every minute matters. But what do you do? First, you spend time routing the issue to the right team. Then you spend more time trying to establish context with individuals who don't always know your environment. Then even more time escalating, trying to get subject matter experts, people who actually know the issue and help solve the problem. Meanwhile, your customers are impacted, your revenue is bleeding. And if you're in a highly regulated environment like the airlines, healthcare, financial services, you're potentially facing complex compliance issues. And brain damage that extends well beyond the immediate event. What I hear when I talk to customers is that we need more than just reactive support. We need a partnership that understands our business, knows our architecture, and can help us prevent problems before they impact our customers. Customers are telling us that 99.9% availability, which might sound impressive at first, still means 43 minutes. Of monthly operation. The reality is that the traditional operations processes. Don't meet the needs Of our most critical workloads. The traditional process looks something like this. First It takes time to even detect the issue, that something's gone wrong. Assuming that you have good observability. Alarms fire, you spin up an incident bridge, you page in your SREs, your developers, your operations teams, they spend time trying to figure out what went wrong. After rolling out the basics, you open a support case with AWS takes us time, we eventually jump on the call. We ask a bunch of basic questions because we don't understand the particular workload, the environment that you're running. Troubleshooting then goes down a rabbit hole of possible components that could be causing the issue until eventually someone finds a needle in a haystack that leads to the root cause. Everybody pretty much goes through the same steps, from detecting the issue, to engaging people, to investigating the problem. To trying to mitigate the issue and finally resolving it, so how do we fix this? The traditional approach often involves teams spending a lot of time at the end of the software development life cycle, attempting to perform security, load testing, failure testing, trying to catch and prevent issues. And while these are good and necessary. What we've found over time is that they're not enough. You have to shift further left in the life cycle to design operations from the very beginning. You have to plan for not just how your applications are gonna work when everything is functioning as expected. But you have to plan for how your applications will programmatically detect, engage, mitigate, and resolve issues when systems and components fail. And you can't just do this in the silo of your own team, in your own code. You have to design your operations for that complex set of dependencies across various components and vendors. And that's why we built AWS Unified Operations. It's a new approach that brings together AWS experts and AI powered tools to prevent problems, respond to critical incidents in under 5 minutes. And continuously improve your operations. Unified operations isn't just another support tier. It's a comprehensive partnership designed for your most critical workloads. We're talking about proactive guidance through detailed operational readiness reviews. With subject matter experts from AWS. Rapid incident response with round the clock alerting based on your alarms and your configuration. And context aware incident management. And continuous improvement through workload refinement. And proactive assessments. This represents a fundamental shift from reactive support to proactive operational excellence. Instead of waiting for problems to occur. We work with you to identify and resolve potential risks before they impact your business. Our proactive guidance and support is designed to work with your team before, during, and after incidents. And while I know our support and account teams have always helped customers design well architected and highly resilient workloads, we also know that even the best designed applications still experience issues. And so that's why we perform workload reviews focused on various failure modes. That we've learned over time at AWS that impact customers and develop application specific runbooks. And once we built. The plan, we work with your team to perform testing and game day simulations to make sure everyone responsible for the workload knows what to do. And while I know that most of us just want to go back to sleep after an event. Failure often represents some of the most important learning opportunities for both businesses and individuals. At AWS we built a culture with defined mechanisms designed to help us dive deep, learn, and implement changes that not only fix the technical problems, but help with the human problems as well. And all of this work, everything that we do upfront to help you assess, prepare, creating run books and artifacts flows directly into our new AI powered tools for troubleshooting and monitoring. Our new AWS DevOps agent that Matt announced earlier in support assistance leverage the knowledge. That we've gained about your workloads, the alarms, the run books that we've built. To not only provide the AI more contextual awareness, to help with troubleshooting, to help your engineers with troubleshooting, but to also help our subject matter experts. To speed resolution of those issues for you. And now I could talk for the next hour telling you about the technical capabilities of unified operations and operational best practices, but I think it'll be more compelling to hear from someone who's living this transformation firsthand. We're talking Sorry, the airline industry. Represents one of the most demanding operational environments imaginable. We're talking 24/7, 365 operations with zero tolerance for downtime, complex regulatory environments, and systems where a single failure can cascade across an entire network, affecting not only the technology, but the human processes, affecting thousands of passengers and millions in revenue. I'm excited to welcome to the stage, someone who can share this journey firsthand, Ninos Gabriel, managing director of United Airlines. Thank you, Jason. Thank you I appreciate that, Jason. Um, Jason laid out a, a fantastic framework and and how to apply practical solutions to something that we all deal with. Let's talk a little bit about United Airlines. How many of you guys flew United into the reinvent? I'm, I'm looking at the United folks, uh, you guys better fly United. So we don't need an introduction to talk about United Airlines. A lot of people know United Airlines, but here's some tidbit that's interesting. Next year we will be a 100 year old organization. Right, so imagine that we balance operation with innovation. We are not. Sitting on our rolls and we're always looking for the next step to do innovation, right? We have 175 million people moving on an annual basis safely and that's something we won't compromise on. 360 destinations around the globe, 5000 daily flights. That's global as well from a technology perspective just to kinda paint the picture we're pretty complex we're probably not the largest I'm sure there's other large organizations here but. 2100 applications, 4300 plus I think we're hitting 4400, um, microservices and APIs and that number is gonna increase as we transform into the microservices architecture and transition to the cloud, um, digital channels 5 billion hits on a daily basis. Why am I telling you all this? The reason I'm telling you all this is because. We are balancing operation which is 24/7 365 with a heterogeneous environment that has mainframe on the back end. You have middleware stacks and layers and we have innovation and oh by the way AI in the cloud, right? And that's the level of complexity that you guys should walk away with is if United Airlines could do that with the level of complexity that we have then a lot of organization could be following the footsteps. So what did we do here? We focused on the architectural and operational aspect to put in a framework together to allow unified operation to work. We're gonna simplify things quite a bit and the reason we do that is because our goal is to be efficient. Our goal is to make sure as we're going through and developing solutions and going into production we're doing it in a way that is allowing us to shift things left and you've heard Jason talk about shifting left so then we talked about all right how do we develop this digital technology operating platform that allows us to actually. Look at all the different things that the developer, the engineering, the infrastructure, the security team, the DevOps teams do, and all the baton handoffs that happen in the SDLC. If you look at your own SDLC, you'll see a plethora of opportunities where you could be efficient on, and this is why we developed DTOP. And what it is, it basically is looking at ways where we look at the manual steps within the SDLC and ask ourselves why is it manual? Can it be automated? Can we inject AI in the middle? What's the advantage of doing that? So that's what we did. I'm not gonna go through the entire slide here, but we've taken the SDLC and we've actually went a layer below. So I would recommend you do the same thing. Take your SDLC. Look at all the steps. Start from the business requirements, which, by the way, if you figure out how to do pristine business requirements, let's talk offline. I wanna know how you did it, right? All the way to DevOps and production. Look at all the steps that happen in between, and I guarantee you you're gonna have a similar graph that we have today. We have about 27 capabilities, and these are capabilities that are unique to United. I'm happy to share them with you and and talk offline about each specific one, but some of these include does the developer develop code that is secure out of the gate. Do we have a code assist capability? How do we make sure that what we're developing and pushing into production doesn't introduce new vulnerabilities? Because you know the boomerang effect of having the engineering and infrastructure and developers go back to fix something that they've released into production is a monumental time that's time, effort, and efficiency loss, right? So therefore we are relying on the engineering aspect of standardization. My role, I lead the enterprise architecture practice. I am keen to make sure that when we develop solutions they are repeatable solutions. Our data are always boundaryless. Our solutions are always gonna be repeatable and we have engineering teams. We've been very fortunate. United Airlines, capable people that allow us to build solution that could be repeatable across the organization. And that is key in making sure that we have consistency. It's key to making sure that we have solutions like unified operation that allow us to inject in the middle we feel comfortable that the solutions that we are pumping out in the production are done in a way that are aligned to the architecture framework. All right. So how does unified operation help United? Quite a lot actually, but when you think about it you gotta think about what drives the efficiency goal? Why do we wanna be efficient? Why could we be slower, maybe a few minutes slower? What's the big deal? Well, we know for a fact our customers are very keen they wanna arrive on time they wanna get to the airport they wanna get to their flight they have important places to be and we make sure from an operational perspective on the business side and all the way to the operational aspect of the technology side. Making sure that that customer arrives on time because they have an important place to be and we know that is important because it it actually shows up in the MPS scores. Customers are 3 times more likely to recommend us if we keep them on time. How does that tie into unified operation, you may ask? Quite a lot. Unified operation gives us the ability when we have an incident. And I'm saying when because incidents will happen. We're not gonna get rid of them. They are jumping on a call with us within 5 minutes or less. And these engineers from unified operation that are jumping with us, they're knowledgeable about the applications they're knowledgeable about the stack that's behind the scene within AWS. There's quite a lot of observability exchange and and channels that are open across. So now we are reducing the amount of troubleshooting and moving into resolution. We all wake up at 2 a.m. for an incident. Some of us can't go back to sleep. I really can't go back to sleep after incidents. It's just me, right? But wouldn't it be nice to reduce that time? But we're not doing it for us, we're doing it for our customers. So building reliability is key to our solutions. Reliability is something that we're always going to do innovative thing to achieve. How do we tie that into the business outcomes? Because you've got to take it all the way to the business. Let me give you this stat. We have 1,000+ automated cross-regional failovers. We do that now. Be honest, raise your hand. How many of you guys are confident when there's an incident. That you will automatically fail over by pushing a button. Couple of you guys, look, I mean that's normal we're not there either like I'll be honest with you in some cases say hm can we troubleshoot more because we think this failover may introduce something new, right? And that is something that you all have to solve and we've done a pretty good job of solving that at United Airlines. We're getting more comfortable in the automated failovers and the reason we do that is because in the event of an incident we wanna fail over quickly and restore the service. This is not about troubleshooting. It's about restoring the service so our customers get to where they need to be. And oh by the way, that reduces MTTR by 7% which we hit that we're gonna hit that more and it's year after year after year we're achieving better success again unified operation is the foundation that's allowing us to do that. Oh, and then you have 5 points of improved MPS scores because of that. So the digital technology is critical and paramount to the security, safety, and the capability that United Airline offers. And with that I'll hand it over to the expert side to talk about the technical aspect of unified operation. Thank you. Good evening everyone. Thank you, thank you, Jason, for setting the stage on broader industry challenges with operations and thank you, Ninas for briefing us on, uh, United's, uh, shift lift initiatives and their rigor and resilience and operations. As you've just heard, United has some interesting requirements and challenges with operations. They have a complex landscape, technological landscape. I'm excited to share with you today a journey about AWS unified operations. How it is specifically suited. To take care of those requirements at United. What you're about to see today is not just a new support model. It's the way in which AWS approaches mission-critical operations together with our customers. I'm sure this is gonna offer some interesting insights for the executives who are managing complex operations on AWS and beyond. Before rolling out unified operations across United, across the complex landscape, we wanted to demonstrate and refine this process with a specific set of critical applications. So when we picked these applications as a sample, we were deliberate about a couple of things. One was we wanted these applications to have different architecture patterns and applications that use different AWS services that are commonly used across the portfolios of United. So with that criteria in mind, we partnered with United and we identified these 4 applications areas, reservation management system. Airport operations, fleet maintenance, and weight and balance. reservation management system, as you all know, thousands of transactions every hour, bookings, modifications, schedule changes, a 15 minutes downtime with these applications could impact hundreds of passengers. Similarly, other application areas are really critical to turnaround flights and avoid delays. So with that uh scope, We structured the implementation of unified operations like a carefully defined flight path. In weeks 1 and 2. We were focusing on laying the foundation, which is integrating AWS support case system with United's. Incident management system and their monitoring tools. I will talk a little bit more about that in the upcoming slides. And then we had several conversations with United's operations teams in understanding their operations culture, the day to day challenges that they have, the nuances and the best practices that they follow so that we can absorb that and come up with a tailored approach. In weeks 3 and 4. We're focusing on the 4 applications. We dove deep into the architecture aspects of the applications, so we have designated support engineers or service experts from unified operations who were looking at these operations, not at the service surface level. We were diving deep and performing architectural reviews and operational readiness reviews on these applications. These reviews gave us valuable insights. We were able to identify several opportunities to improve resiliency posture, security posture, performance, and availability posture of these applications. And then in weeks 5 and 6, we went into what I call rehearsal phase in which we brought AWS operations and united operations and application teams together and performed some simulations of real-life incidents. The space the simulations, um, you know, we, we did to understand how the engagement works, how the communication works, how the orchestration and and uh and and getting to the resolution of the issue works. This is to make sure that the teams on both the sides work in synchronization. And we, we found some interesting, uh, you know, learnings and, uh, um, uh, you know, some, some gaps that we, uh, try to fulfill with, uh, with this, uh, with this pilot. And then from week 7 onwards, that's when our proactive support starts. So our, uh, designated engineers, um, they work closely with the application teams on an ongoing basis for continuous improvement of, um, um, the best practices and, uh, you know, implementing AWS, uh, well architected pillar best practices. At United Airlines, you must have uh already heard from Ninos and Jason at United Airlines operations excellence and resilience are not just goals, they are the foundation. A mere 15 minutes delay or latencies in a check-in application. Remember, gate check-in application. Right? It could impact 100s of passengers, dozens of airports. It could easily have cascading effect. A lot of other flights that are coming into that gate, a lot of connecting flights, crew scheduling. A whole lot of things. Right? So what United needed wasn't just faster response times. They needed a partner who can understand the business context of the application. Who can understand the architecture of the application and the gaps because we performed reviews on them already. And then bring that knowledge over for faster resolution. This is what AWS Unified Operations delivers. And how did we do it at United? We took an approach to integrate people, process, and tools. Let me talk about the most crucial aspect of any operational transformation. The people part. What you see here is not just an organization structure. It's about how AWS Unified Operations and AWS. Brings in expertise into United's operational framework into their organization structure without disrupting their core processes. On United's side, we had United operations team, incident managers who tackle day to day challenges with operations. And then application teams who are responsible for development, maintenance, and stability of the applications, platform team, architecture teams, etc. And then on AWS side, we have this account team. If you're on enterprise support, you already know technical account managers, solution architects who work with you closely. With United closely in, uh, uh, providing strategic guidance. And making sure they get the required help and expertise for their cloud journey. On top of this, AWS Unified operations. With that, we brought two additional personas, incident management engineers and service experts. Incident management engineers are 24/7 on-call who respond to your critical issues. Within 5 minutes. Interestingly, they also would bring run books. The context The business impact of the application that's involved. So that you get to resolution faster and these folks also along with United's incident managers orchestrate the issue for, you know, getting faster escalations done and bring right people to get, get to the resolution sooner. And then the service domain experts. So these are engineers who are specialized in one or more AWS domains. Right? They bring in. Years of learning by solving problems across millions of AWS customers. In addition to that, since we already have them go through the applications, they also bring business context of the critical applications. So they provide proactive guidance to the application teams. Now, these are not just theoretical suggestions. They work alongside with the application teams to prioritize and help them implement those improvements so that you prevent the issues, you prevent risks from becoming issues in production later. All right. The 2nd pillar in this approach is integrating United's incident management and monitoring tools with AWS support. United is operating, as you all know, 24/7, 365 days. Jason and Nino's talked at stretch about it. Every minute of downtime could impact hundreds of passengers. It's very critical. This led us to design 3 additional ways in which United can engage AWS support. On top of the existing process. The first one is direct critical incident creation. Through this, we integrated AWS support with United's incident Management System, which is ServiceNow. So incident managers from United, when they see an issue brewing into a P1 or P2 incident, they can create AWS support case from within ServiceNow itself. They don't have to log into console. So those who are operating critical applications, you all know every minute during an issue on a critical application counts, and we are trying our best to reduce the detection and awareness phase through this. The second one, and this is an interesting and important aspect of UNIFID operations, is rapid alert ingestion. What this means is we integrated United's monitoring tool. With the AWS support case system. Now, how does it work? For example, If there is a baggage scanner application or a reser reservation application, the transactions are, um, airing out or experiencing latencies for 3 minutes, 5 minutes, whatever that is. When it reaches threshold, the monitoring tool alerts. It fires an alarm. So we use that alarm. To send an event to AWS support case system and from there create AWS support case, a critical support case on behalf of United. So what we're trying to do here is we don't want a human being to look at the dashboard and alarms and decide, hey, I need to create an AWS support case and I need the AWS support. We let the machine do the work for you. So, with this particular integration, and this is going to scale next in the next phase of uh unified operations at United. The idea is to Enable United to shift left further. And reduce their mean time to detect and mean time to engagement metrics. And the third, another important one is the reverse of it. Like, for example, if AWS service experiences impairment, if there's an AWS AWS event, you already get notifications from, uh, health, health, uh, service help desk in, etc. Now what we have done is we've enabled a notification to be directly landing into United's, uh, monitoring tool. From there they get the ability to either engage the right application team. To say that hey this application uses this service and this seems to be experiencing some issues we've got a notification or they can even create a P1 and P2 incident if the incident manager already knows there's an issue and engage. AWS support sooner. So in each of these channels, the idea is To get the engagement sooner. And get to the resolution faster. Interestingly, Regardless of the channel that you create AWS case from, we always initiate the same, same sort of engagement protocol, which is incident management engineer joining, uh, attending your case in 5 minutes. OK, next, with the required people and tooling integration, we ensured AWS processes aligned seamlessly with United's operational rhythm. Our approach included two elements proactive and reactive. We've always been talking about proactive side of, uh, things. Um, Ninos and Jason also emphasized a couple of, uh, examples. And on the proactive side, what we're doing is, as I said, we are bringing in service, uh, domain engineers. who bring in knowledge about AWS services and the context of the application itself. So they review the application from an architecture standpoint, from an operational standpoint, and come up with um improvements. Right, so when we perform these reviews on 4 of these applications, we had some interesting insights. For example, uh, we, uh, in, in the fleet maintenance application we, we found, uh, you know, an opportunity to enable ACS, sorry, ACS, um, uh, the container applications, uh, um, availability zone, uh, rebalancing so that the tasks are balanced across AZS. In the case of AZ impairment, the application would still be statically stable, and you have high fault tolerance on the application. Similarly, on the database side, uh, we found an opportunity to enable point in time restoration. So if there is any corrupt, uh, malformed rights or corrupt data, you have a, uh, you know, a good known state of the database to restore from. So these are, uh, you know, just some examples that we were able to accomplish in the last few weeks. And on the reactive site, Again, like if a case is created, our incident management engineer attends to your case within 5 minutes. And they also bring run books with them, so they know the escalation paths. They know the charade of how to communicate, how to engage on both the sides. Right? With teams aligned, processes, tools connected, we were ready to use unified operations across the four applications. This is the approach we took and think of this as our, uh, you know, clear to take off moment, a 12 week journey into. Enabling unified operations for these critical apps and making sure that. The process works for United and uh fine tune refine some of the nuances that we found along the way so we had some really interesting learnings, understanding and improvements along the way and I'd like to share, you know, some good outcomes that we got out of it. For critical case response time. We observed more than 70% improvement in meantime to engage metrics, and this metric is what feeding directly into the MTTR that Ninos was talking about so we wanna continuously engage with United and see how we can contribute to improving their MTTR metrics which they have as a goal and eventually it's going to, um, you know, feed directly into the metric availability metric of critical applications. And then we implemented small enhancements to bridge call procedures, escalation matrix, and uh the communication framework so that the stakeholders and leadership on both AWS and United sides. Are kept aware of how the issue is progressing, how the diagnosis is moving, how far are we from resolution, etc. so these are some nuanced things that we improved along the way and uh for those of you managing operations teams, these enhancements, you know very well directly translate to business uh impact. So what we are trying to drive is foster awareness, foster detection. And faster faster response results in resolution. And it helps you drive. Near to zero downtime. Beyond incident management, we also had significant outcomes in proactive engagement. For the application context, you know, that we gathered during the onboarding of these 4 applications, we enabled AWS supports an agent. To provide tailored recommendations to support engineers, for example, if United creates. A general guidance case or a performance, you know, impairment case or something for these 4 apps right now the agent not only provides recommendation on how to solve it to the support engineer on the AWS side. It also provides the context of the application itself, about the architecture and the learnings that we had and the improvements that we made on the application. So as we progress more into, you know, more additional capabilities in, uh, AI space, you're gonna see more of this coming and more benefits to our customers and before migration of critical application to AWS, our engineers also helped them identify some opportunities in improving the architecture for example, um, in, in one of the applications we found, um, you know, uh, uh, uh, the core part of the application is failing over, uh, fine, but then the independences was not, we're not failing over. So our engineers worked alongside with the application teams and emphasize why it's important to have dependencies also fail over so that you don't. You don't get into bimodal behavior of the application, so these are some important resilience concepts that we have been driving with the application teams and we want to continue to do that on an ongoing basis. That's why we, we emphasize on continuous improvement as part of AWS unified operations. The focus is not only fixing problems faster, but also to prevent them, prevent them from occurring in the first place. So that's why we are emphasizing on proactive and reactive all the time with unified operations. Right? So, looking ahead, United's journey with unified operations is just beginning. The roadmap is to expand AWS unified operations across to a number of critical applications in the coming months. And it's not just about scaling. It's about force multiplying the learnings we have had during this twelve-week journey. And making sure that the rest of the critical applications also benefit from those processes. And through this engagement, we're also augmenting United with their Shift Left initiatives across applications. This means the applications will go live. After operational reviews, architecture reviews, with the help of AWS engineers or the domain experts that we have. And also, you know, with incident, uh, reactive side of things we wanna also provide a feedback loop from AWS side if you find some interesting opportunities of improvement based on an incident, we wanna feedback into the shift lift initiatives that Ninos was talking about which is the top. Right? So whether you're running financial applications, retail, you know, another airline or anything, uh, if you have critical applications on AWS, transforming operations is not just about resolving issues sooner, it's also about preventing them. Identifying opportunities for improvement and continuously improving them. There are several excellent sessions. I'm sure you must have attended a few in the last two days. There are a few more coming up, especially in AWS support AI, um, observability, operations excellence, and resiliency. Please take advantage of these sessions. If you have mission critical workloads on AWS, talk to your account team and start your own AWS unified operations journey. And thank you for your attention.
