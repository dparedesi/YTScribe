Alright, so hello everyone. Welcome to the last session of the first day of reinvent. That was one of the sentences that I thought I would never make, but here we are. It's good to see you all. I'm Sally. I'm a senior delware advocate with AWS, and I have Matt alongside me. Hey, I'm Matt. I'm a senior principal engineer. I work in, uh, AWS developer tools. You can think of things like cloud formation, the code suite, uh, the CDK, uh, excited to show you guys a bunch of stuff we've been doing with that lately. So today Yes, we have slides, but this is the only slide that we have. Since this is a core talk, we wanted to create something from scratch for you, and what we're going to build is we're going to build a full stack application from scratch. First we will build the front end, then we will do the deployment, add some features, this geneative AI features alongside it. Uh, we will talk about best practices, what we have released recently to help you out to build this stuff, and most importantly, of course, later on we will share some resources for you to try out as well. And today's idea, today's app idea actually came from a need of mine. So that's why you will be seeing we're building something to solve a problem of mine. I play a lot of games, and one thing that I was missing was a platform to exchange games or sell games or see what what my, uh, friends played. I love Goodreads, for example. I can see what they're doing besides selling books, but at this, it's doing a lot of things. I wanted to have a version of that for games for me. And I wanted to build it from scratch and I was like I built something and I liked it and we were discussing and we will build it today together as well. So I guess I will sit so. All right. So we will be relying a lot on agents today. And how many of you have heard of Quiro? Nice. So Qiro is the agenttic ID that is allowing you to build your applications through not only white coding but also Specter in the open as well. And we will be using Quiro today to build our application. And We will start from very basic to build our application then do every connection that is needed. So first of all, what we are going to, I will show you a few things, but before I move forward, I wanna ask you, can everyone in the back can see it or? If not, all right, perfect. So We are not people who are believing in agents or AI that is going to uh build everything and we will just commit it blindly. We will explain the code and of course we know it's not, it's not going to be perfect, but the important point is we wanna showcase the thought process of how to start and move forward with, with everything that, uh, that we have. Alright. Without further ado, first thing that we are going to do is to actually create a front-end project. For the front-end project, I decided to go with React and Ved. I love React so much, and I, uh, Viet is, I think, making my Deer experience better for the folks who are not front-end developers. Vet is a developer tool that is allowing you to build front-end applications in a more efficient or effective way. It gives you proper test suites and so on, so you can have a proper way of building stuff. In this Prompt that I have here I just talked about creating a react application, but we know there's a problem with large language models. They have cutoff dates and cut off dates are making them. Uh, open for not having, uh, the latest version of the libraries and so on, right? So what we are going to have here is we will show how we can add additional context. First thing that you can do is to actually add documentation. Many agentic IDs have documentation alongside it, so you can just search for in this case, react here, and this will bring in the context of React documentation. This React documentation is not the full documentation website that you might imagine, no, it's actually a separate markdown file that is bringing in court snippets and enough information to build information. And alongside I give information about like tailwind for example to build those CSS properly because classic CSS we know it's not very. Uh, nice to go with it, and I'm going to use chats in UI to be able to have the UI components as well, but if I go to my talks here. And if I go to my dogs here and write shut. See, and you can see that I have no result because I don't have a dock that is available on the planet Earth. For this purpose, we are going to use MCP servers. How many of you have heard of MTPs before? OK, more hands, more hands. So MCP is the model context protocol. This is basically like uh. System that is allowing you to plug in additional information to the large language models so they can understand more of the context that you want to tell them. And since they know more about it, they will act accordingly as well. I will use one of the most famous ones which is called Context 7. Context 7 has both open source and official, sorry, third party and official, uh, documentation alongside it. And for that to pick up, I'm just going to say 4 sh CN use context 7. And after I did this, do this, we will start the process first thing that the. Chat is going to do is to actually call the contact 7. It will get first library ID. It will get the most highly rated one. It will get the information about the UI part because ChatN has more of what you can think of and what you can guess as well and. Meanwhile, it does that, it gets every information that is available through the React and how to build it as well. Once we move forward, it says, OK, now I have enough information. I will, uh, create it. Now it's just a process of accepting everything, and it will add the libraries to create the basic project. The command that we have here is not magic. When you were, when we didn't have AI in our lives, this is how we were creating the big project as well. It was not magic that we were doing before. So it actually created the project directly. You can see that this is the most beautiful app in the world. It's a counter app with React. So we are in a good place. We already started with the first task down. The second task was adding the CSS and so on. What to add this stuff, it will go through the documentation that we have either in the ID or bring in whatever we need, and it will go iteratively because in the Prompt here I said do in the step by step that I have provided over here. In the meantime, this does that I wanna take you through a little bit of a journey of how crazy things have changed in the last few years. Like, I wanna ask you how many of you are using agentic IDs like Cloudcre, Cursor, Qiro. Yes, so like we have a, like we, we have a few folks that are not using either they don't like it or like company policies and so on and so forth, but two years ago I remember seeing, uh, some folks adding a comment on an empty file and saying it create a 2 + 2 function for me in Java, and immediately it was like filling it out, uh, with every information, any, uh, simple function. I was thinking, wow, like that's crazy, that's going to change everything. Then like time moved forward into like last year more or less 2024. I'm sure many of you have heard of done that like we went to the chat places like ChichiBT or Cloud and asked like I wanna build this platform and can you just do this thing and we were copying and pasting or downloading whatever file that it was creating and we were saying wow that's even better and now we are living in the age of uh agents which is basically changing everything. And that is what we are going to do today. Like, these are like one thing that I, we wanna emphasize is everything that we do, we have to understand why and how we do it because agents are as smart as you tell them to be. If I just sit down here and say that build me a game platform that will probably build the most ugliest and most like unstructured, uh, app that you will ever see. But if you tell more and more information, if you give more and more information, it will be. Understanding what you mean uh for them to move forward as well. So like we are moving forward and another stuff I wanna show uh talk to you about two things that is, uh, very valuable from the QR perspective. One is every time that I that that it its through something you can see that it checks out these steaming files. Steering files are your rule files that are allowing the agent to know what borders that you have for your application for these rules. You can define either structure or tech perspective. For example, in here, what I said was, for a, for a React project, always make sure that you have NPM run built, run in place. And the second thing that I do is for a TypeScript project, never use any, because In case you're a beginner or a type script and he is your enemy. Just, just saying, don't use it. So this allows me to actually move forward uh faster because it gives me a sanity check that everything will be all right. So, now we have created. Every step that we wanted to create, the next thing that we will do is to create data perspective. In the meantime, it creates the data. I will also take you through the files that we have created so far. So I have created, so what I have here is I say create TypeScript interfaces with user game listing, everything that I might be needing to create this game information. And I, I like, I wanna have a chat. I wanna have an AI chat in addition to this as well, and every information is right now supposed to be mocked because I like, uh, the to turn it into full stack, we will do it in the next stage. So if I go back to my application, you can see that I created something that I that I call my app here. And in my app, when you create an application, it will already create the structure for you, so you do not have any additional information here. One thing that we do here is. And one thing that we do have to uh know here is like. The app.TSX file is our starting point. Everything that is happening, or let me take this way? Yes, it works in the meantime. It allows you to define your teaming, define your navigation, define any information that needs to be dropped in from top to bottom. The provider perspective of React is allowing you to think of a, um, think of a component tree from top to bottom in case you wanna send a message. This is how you do it. So from the team, if you wanna send a message to the route or what like browser router or any UI element like home. You have to like wrap it with the team provider alongside as well. So from the pages perspective, pages is an API that is allowing you to create the navigation flow with the name of the files. So if I go to home here, I have some like information about like summit and the uh counter because we had the counter file that we have created, right, and it just moves forward and changed everything in the meantime. I wanna put a pause as you see, thanks to the MPMR built now I found. An error that was normally supposed to be, for example, get accepted, but now I can go through it and it automatically fixes that. You might be wondering why it is making that error in the beginning anyway. Because it just goes through it, it doesn't see the before it, it, the moment that it's in. It just has the information that we provided as we move forward, it, it is not aware of thinking of like what is going to happen next. It just does with the things that it knows. So that is why you have to know what you're doing needs to uh work out properly. Anyway, so what we, what we have done here is we have changed the, uh, UI a bit. Uh, what we have done was basically we have created, uh. Toggle to have the light and dark mode. We have added some email information to register this is super arbitrary. We will make it better with authentication flow, but what it did was it created a flow of uh. UI to accompany the data that we have. Now we will go to the data, but before we go, let's create the layout components. The layout components that I have here is Just basic components that you would have, for example, like header, footer, some, uh, some information about being responsive like if it's smaller showing show a burger menu and so on and so forth and with the styling and so on we have the uh gradient perspective as well for the mock data. I have some important points that I wanna share. So it created everything, but we have to understand that this is our contract. They wanna build a database out of the information that is provided here. The agent will come here and actually build the database from it because we will tell it to do so, but at the same time it will see this as the uh source of truth. It will go through everything and get the necessary information and if I go back here you can see that even the mock data is arranged in the way that. This when this information is seeded into the database, it is going to be there for us to use. And now you can see that we for example have user data. We have, for example, game data. Since we don't have a game. MCP, it is used in some games from 2023. Legend of Zelda was amazing, but like, for example, God of War, Ragnarok or Halo Infinite, and so on and so forth as well. So if you had MCP for example, for the folks who uh doesn't have MCP we would have for example operators which is the uh hot game of the year right now. Alright, so we have the mock data in place and we have added the layout components. Now I want to create a login page again, accompanying what I have uh created with the mock data. As you see, I see, I mentioned the page where it's supposed to go. Why do, why do I do it? Because I want to make this and make sure that this is part of my authentication flow. The second part is I will use my imagination to describe what I have in mind so it can add that information like center the card layout, showcase this, have a different color on the bottom so it knows what the sign up button does, and so on as you go like more complex, uh, as you go more. Deeper and deeper you would realize that. Just create an authentication page, will not do what whatever you need. So, it goes and reads through everything and it says like now I have a good understanding of the project and it just creating everything in the meantime. After we create the author page, we will have the AI chat because we promised you an AI chat, real-time AI mechanism alongside as well. And last but not least, later on, we will do the timing. With everything in place you can see that each operation or each iteration of the pages, it takes roughly around 2 or 3 minutes. I counted more or less, so I'm relatively sure about the uh like besides the first one, first one took around like 3 minutes to set up everything and everything else took less for these purposes we were actually using templates before but the problem with templates were they were going out of uh. Out of date easily, so we need to have someone working on the templates to keep everything in place and like in the meantime for an intern project or so we were dedicating someone to build this plus bringing everything and hope hoping that everything would work. But right now thanks to for example steering files you can define your country, uh, company rules and you can define everything that is going to work with this project as well. An agent can bring this. Into life, so you can see where you can start off or like move forward as well. All right, so. We can see that the authentication page is created. Now we will add the AI system page. AI system page is going to look like everything that you have seen so far. It's going to have a chat window, it will have some additional suggestions, so you can take it out, and once you have everything in place. It will give you an answer. Right now it will give you a mock answer. The mock answer will have a delay of 300 milliseconds to make you feel like, yes, everything is real data, but it's not. The real data will come on later. With the AI stuff moving forward, of course MCP is not the only way to expand what we need in case you wanna add additional context or in case you want to make them smarter, you can also connect your databases. You can also connect your processes as well. This will allow you to make them smarter. So right now, probably if you're working for a company, you're getting asked like how can we add AI to this? How can we have like make this smarter or make this move forward as well. So these are the ways to do it, like you can add. A large language model, but that's not enough nowadays. You have to make it more specified and more smarter as well. Alright, so right now this committed everything. The AI system page is done. Last thing that, uh, that we are going to do is to change some stuff around this timing. In the meantime, I wanna showcase the AI system page. In the AI system page you can see that we have hardcore suggestions, so it's totally up to you to define what you want to do here. Also, we are using different states of react to be able to say that, hey. We are waiting for a response. We get the response and we are acting on it. There are two ways to act on the AI chat mechanisms. One of them is you send a prompt and you wait and you get the chunk of data and shove it immediately. And the other one is called streaming, um, uh, streaming approach. You can just get it one word by uh one word by word. My brain is slowly leaving my words as well. Uh, you will like, you will get word by word, bring everything together and showcase it directly. But in here we're just sending and receiving the information as well. So with everything in place now we have changed the UIs, we have changed the CSS files. Everybody, including myself, we always complain about CSS, how we forget it, how to do it, and so on. This way you can bring in the colors, the structure, and everything that you need to, uh. Showcase what you have mentioned envisioned in case you don't wanna do this, you can also drag and drop your uh color scheme directly here, and it will create the prompt out of it as well. For us, the important point is, like I wanna emphasize this one more time, we are not here to just say. Style this or change this or something or I'm like we are not here to say that make this modern no we are here to bring our brand we are here to bring our knowledge we are here to bring of how we have envisioned it to go around. I love seeing cards. Maybe it's because like when I saw them for the first time when the material design was out, I, I fell in love with them and I, I, I like using them and everything that I explained here, not only but authentication and so on for UI perspective is coming from what I have envisioned earlier on. So everything is in place, let's see how it looks like. So right now we have this. OK, so more or less we have like uh the game app with the username password, we have the sign up page and I can just add my username. And the passwords as well. And once I add that you can see that it takes me to the AI system page, but we have like we have also like home marketplace self chat and so on that I have told you about earlier on. And if I do this thing you can see the 300 milliseconds and it just gets some information back to me. So now everything in place, I will slowly hand over to Matt so we can take this fun into another level. So Matt, all right, thanks. Um, how many people were surprised that that worked? No, actually, I'm a couple over there. I'm actually not actually. There's actually something really interesting that he did, um, which I think is the best practice, um, that everyone should be following. I don't know how many of you have been, well, I guess maybe roughly half of the people have been using AI-based IDs. 11 interesting thing he did, um, if you all noticed, is he broke up his prompts into very small things, right? He said, first I'm gonna create an app, and then I'm gonna add mock data, and then I'm going to, uh, uh, add AI, I think, and I forget what all of them were, but he did them one by one. And I think that like the um the smaller you break these things up into little pieces, the more likely the AI is gonna understand what you are doing and actually go and execute on it. I'm gonna do the opposite, uh, so this is, uh, this is gonna be a little bit of vibe presenting, I guess, um, so what I'm gonna do, we talked about MCP servers, uh, how many people here have actually built an MCP server themselves? Couple, couple of them, OK, um, so I have one myself. I'm gonna enable it over here. Uh, you can see in Quiro over on the left hand side here there's this little ghost icon, and down here you've got all the MCP servers. I think you had the context 71 installed. We're gonna install mine here, and what this is gonna do, um, there's an MCP server I built with semi-functionality I've been using. I've been taking a lot of applications and trying to deploy them onto AWS with best, uh, best practices, and the experience that I'm trying to, um, enable for my own internal use is that I come here into this and I just type deploy. My app and what do you guys think, is it gonna work? So you can see it's, it's reading the steering files we talked about. Uh, it says it's gonna help deploy it. It called my tool and you can see that it gets a script name called Run deployment Assistant. So this return, this whole big prompt is the net, this is a prompt that's being returned by the MCP server, and, um, we're not gonna go into all the details of it, but what I'm doing, uh, here is you can see that we've asked it, wait, waiting for my input. What's it doing? OK, so, um. I'm gonna be running a much longer workflow here and so I don't have the the ability to break this up into small steps where I ask the model to do one thing and then another thing and then another thing. I'm actually asking it to, to follow a much more complicated workflow and so to do this, um, I've asked the model to actually maintain a checklist of all the steps and I'm asking it to create this checklist and then as it goes through actually walk through them one by one and check them off itself, uh, and this is, um. This is something I've been, I, I've been using. It helps the, the, the models be more reliable and executing these, these steps, and the steps that I'm actually asking it to, to do in this case are actually follow a bunch of best practices to deploy. You're stuck, so you can stuck again where you can just quit this one. OK, thanks, yeah, cool, um. Yeah, that's always a problem in these demos. OK, um, so, um, I'm trying to deploy his application out to AWS following a bunch of best practices, and I'm gonna walk through a couple of them. For me there's, they're sort of, um, I mean, again, my, my goal here is not just to deploy it, but deploy it in such a way that, uh, I can continue to use agents to build, to, to evolve my infrastructure as, as I go along and so. There's a couple of best practices I think are really important. One of them, you can see here, I have a first step, or step 3, I guess, called, uh, make the code base agent friendly. And this gets back to a lot of what, um, Sally was talking about with like steering files and stuff like that. So if I scroll down here, I'll walk you through a little bit of what I've done. You can see that we have, OK, you, well, well, you can see, see here it's checking off all the steps as it goes along. But if we come down to this part, I'm actually asking to create this file called agents. MD. A lot of, uh, um, agent-based IDs and such, uh, um, look at this file, um, and automatically start including it, and you can see I've got a bunch of things that I ask it to do here. For example, look at the directory doc.design.component. This lets me actually check in uh a documentation into my code base and have the agent look at that and keep it up to date as it works on it. Uh, it, it helps the model have a lot of, uh, extra context on why we're building what we're building. I have some things here, some guidance on how I wanted to actually do get commit messages. I have, um. Uh, I, I, I'm also, um, including a bunch of skills, and these are things that we can ask the model to go and learn how to do things like, um, I'll show you an example here is, uh, logging. So the logging.md file is a specific skill that that explains to it all of the logs are now gonna be in CloudWatch. Go there to find logs. And so as I build things and the and the agent runs into errors, uh, Sally showed an example of an error earlier. I don't know if that was intentional. Or not, but there was an error, and the model self diagnosed it. In this case, if I'm actually deploying infrastructure, the, the model may or may not know how to actually go and diagnose that. And so by including this skill here and telling it, go look in CloudWatch here, I give some example commands about how to actually look for logs in CloudWatch. And by doing this, when we later get to a point and we start, uh, deploying this, um, this application, it can self diagnose things and. Um, I, I'm actually hoping the demo fails and there's errors, so it actually diagnoses and I can, I'll show you that, but we'll see. Um, let's waiting for input again. Hold on, OK, uh, OK, so that's, that's the guidance, uh, to agents. Uh, the second best practice as you saw here was generating CDK. How many people here use infrastructure as code? About half of you guys, how many are you using the CDK? All right, how many are using terraform? OK, how many are using cloud formation directly? Couple as well, OK, um, I, I'm a big fan of the, the CDK, um, but in any case, I think one of the, the, um, the really important things for models is that you use infrastructure as code when you're building and deploying an AWS. If you don't use infrastructure as code and, and, and, and, and there's a tons of examples where you can go and ask the agent to, um, to, to do things like, um, like add an S3 bucket or, uh, sorry, I keep having to unblock this guy. So, so you can ask the agent to like go and, and, and, and add an S3 bucket or add a database and it's probably going to go and use the, the, uh, AWS or CLI or something to start making calls and that's great but once it's made the call, when you ask it to do something else, it's not gonna know that that resource. Was there and so if you ask it to continue to evolve your infrastructure you actually want the agent to be able to know what's already out there and if it needs to go call um the uh um like all different kinds of AWS APIs to explore what's in your account it's gonna take forever. But by using infrastructure's code, whether that's terraform, which it sounds like a lot of you guys are using, or OCDK, which we're using here, you give that context directly into your code base and the agent can actually understand these are the, the, uh, the resources I have. Um, there's also tons of old, old documentation online to, um, the, the that the. Model understands you you you you which are gonna help it sort of design that correctly you can run things like uh the the CDK linters and things like that to actually verify that the uh that the, the, um, the, uh, the CDK code or the infrastructures code if you're building is correct. Um, so you can see here we are, let's see, I'm not sure where we're at in this process. Yeah, here, here, here we're generating things like infra. OTS. So this, for example, is our main, uh, entry point. You can see that we're creating a front end stack here. Uh, we're adding tags to it which are gonna help us, um, uh, they'll, they'll go back and find, um, uh, do, do this application and organize it. Uh, let's see where. Yeah, you can see here, here, for example, this is a good example. This is the front end stack, and you can see that we have an S3 bucket we're creating. This is the S3 bucket which is actually gonna have the contents of our, uh, of our front-end application. Um, here's a cloud front distribution, uh, which we're gonna use to get, uh, better page load times, uh, we, and so on and so forth. Here, here we're adding a resource policy, so here we can actually, um, put all the IME permissions and stuff like that directly into here, and then the, um, the, the agent knows everything that, that you have already. Um, let's see where are we getting, so we are at the point where we are gonna deploy this, um. Let's see, OK, we're deploying. And this is going to take. Couple minutes, um. So you finish doing, uh, the, the last best practice I wanna, I'll, I'll talk to you about. So this year, um, this is actually doing a, uh, ready to deploy. OK, it's, it's actually asking me, so I'm gonna tell it yes, go ahead and deploy, um, and while we wait for that to happen, so, so this deployment is just, is just doing a CDK to deploy and so this is deploying what, what I'm calling in, in, in the, in the context of my, um. Of my application here, uh, this is doing a CDK deployment, um, actually, as you can see, there's a, it's, it's using a script that I've, uh, made here, and let me actually show you this script real quick. Uh, where was it? It was in scripts deploy.sh. So what you can see here is, is, is this is actually walking. This is a script that, that, that my big long prompt actually asked the agent to go and create. And what's interesting about this is it's gonna come in here and it's going to do a bunch of like it's, it's, I mean, it's basically just providing the command to do a CDK deploy. But the reason I've decided to model this one in a script. This is a very the the the this is an action I'm gonna ask it to do again and again and again, and I want it to be deterministic. Any time you ask an agent to do something, there's some level of nondeterminism in there, but my deployment, I don't think I need that. And so I actually asked it to, to, to generate a script. If we went back and looked at the original prompt I had, it's actually um. Uh, it's actually, um, I think I actually include a snippet in there, and so it, it, it, it just sort of pasted the script directly into my code base, and this lets me have a lot of, um, control over how I'm doing the deployment. For example, you can see here that in, um, that there's a check that if I'm doing a preview deployment, which is what we're doing now, I enable a flag called Hot swap fallback. How many have you guys used, have you used that hot swap fallback with CDK deployments? So one thing that you, you, you CDK or cloud formation really provides you for you is, um, it, uh it as it deploys it ensures correctness. So you deploy something it verifies, um, has this actually completed is it consistent or do you know that if you've created a resource you can query it and it's, it's already there, uh, sometimes you don't care about that if you're. Doing your like local development, you probably want a faster iteration loop where you can just uh get deployments out there and just check if there are things working are things working you want that really tight loop um that's something you probably don't want in production because you want the guarantees that the infrastructure is created or deleted or updated as as appropriate. So here I've actually, you, you put in here if I'm doing my local development, I want you to use the hot swappy fallback feature which is going to just go and update lambda or S3 directly and not worry about the full cloud formation in deployment. Um, but in production I don't want that and so by, by, by putting this in a script I've removed some level of nondeterminism where the agent might do something that I don't want. So, um, Right, the other thing I, I, I was gonna call out is that here we are doing a, uh, local preview, right? So I'm just doing a CDK deployment directly. This is really intended for my, um, for my local development. Later I eventually want this to go into a pipeline. Um, we're not gonna walk through that in the demo so much, but I think that pipelines are super important, that that this idea of like a continuous integration, continuous deployment, uh, um. Uh, development cycle, um, I'm gonna be using, oh, well, I'm sorry, if we had, um, if we'd gotten all the way in there, we'd be using a code pipeline. Um, one of the things that I think is really important with, uh, with, with developing with agents is that eventually these agents are gonna do things that you don't expect. Right, like, um, and, and, and they might have generated code that you didn't want, and maybe you looked at, I, I mean, how many of you had, how many of you have had that where you've had an agent, you build something, and you didn't look at every line of the code? You guys ever done that? But if I, OK, a lot of people have done that, right? So I, I mean, I, I, I believe pretty strongly in looking at every line of the code, but occasionally we don't do that. Occasionally we get lazy. Occasionally we have teammates that might not have done that. Occasionally you looked and you didn't realize there was a mistake that the agent made. This is gonna happen. Happen and I, I think this is gonna become increasingly important in our software development life cycle because we're gonna have unsupervised code that goes out there and you want checks. You want checks to make sure there aren't bugs that reach your customers. You want checks to make sure there's not, uh, security v vulnerabilities that get out. You want checks to make sure your costs aren't getting out of control. And so by putting that in a CICD pipeline, you can make sure that there are checks there that act as a safety net. Um, I mean, we should still do our due diligence and review all the code, but just in case you want those checks out there. Um, so, so, so that would be the last best practice that's coded into this, um, if we're getting there, uh, we're still doing this deployment, um, and I've run out of material for this part of it, so maybe while we wait, are there any questions that people have? You got one over here. What's up? Just a second. Let me bring you this, so. Oh They Thank you. So, uh, in our company we also do CDK and partially, uh, generate codes of agents, but now I'm thinking if there is an agent generates the code, why we need CDK? want to not, why not to generate, uh, code formation template right away? Why we need, uh, CDK as an intermediary step? What, so the question is why, why are we having the agent generate CDK instead of cloud formation? Or, or your point being that the CDK is an abstraction on top of cloud formation. It's easier for people, but why would I use LCDK with an agent when it can just go use cloud formation directly? Exactly, it's more or both, but it's declarative, so it might be easier to review. It's a good question. I, I mean, I think, um, I, I, I, I think it would be great to, uh, I, I haven't all done this myself. I, I haven't actually compared whether an agent is more effective with CDK or cloud formation or terraform for that matter, and that'd be a really good comparison because, because, um, I think you're right. You probably want the one that the agent is the most, uh, reliable and generating. Um, the reason I've chosen the CDK is I still think that people are probably gonna look at this. So I, I one thing is that that um that that that people are going to be able to read themselves, um, and so putting it in CDK just because I wanna be able to understand it myself feels like the right decision. Um, CDK also lets you do things like create custom resources and I think there's gonna be cases where you wanna manage things that are not AWBS resources, and I think that's easier to do in CDK than cloud formation. Um, those are the, those are my motivations here for it. Uh, but I think, I mean, I think it's a really good point, and I think, uh, I, I think we're gonna need to keep, uh, evaluating that and figuring out what the best choice is, um. OK, want to automate your deployments. Let's not do that for now. Um, as I said, deployments, I think, are, uh, a CICD pipeline is super important. We would do that if we had more time, but I think we have 24 minutes. So I'm going to first pull up the, uh, the link here. So this is the link that, um, we've deployed it to. Let's go back to your browser. Is this your browser? Yeah, yeah, OK. So let's load it. Let's see if it. Cool, so we got our app. Uh, so I think I need to sign up again here. We'll put Matt here. And Not now, and you can see we've logged in. Now, as Sally mentioned before, this AI assistant is not super helpful. Like if I typed in something here like, um, I don't know, tell me a joke, it's gonna give me a, it's gonna give me a hard, uh, a hard coded answer back about he's a, you know, gaming marketplace assistant, blah blah blah. We probably wanna have something more interesting here. So what I'm gonna do is, um. Somewhere in here I have a bunch more prompts so I, I've got a prompt here which is going to add bed a bedrock integration. Um, I'm going to kick this one off. I'm not going to actually, um. Uh, I, I'm gonna, I'll kick it off and then I'm gonna explain a little bit about it. So, how, how many of you guys have, um, I may have already asked this question, but how many people have written or have spent a lot of time writing prompts and struggling with how to get your agent to do something interesting? Yeah, it's hard sometimes, right, um. I, I, uh, so I didn't write this prompt, uh, I'm gonna be honest. I mean I can walk you through you through this prompt, but, but you can see it, it has a task. It says add AI functionality checklist, you know, blah blah blah blah. I didn't write a single line in here. What I actually did was I, um, I, I have another, uh, um, markdown file that I give to agents that tells it how to write good prompts. And what I actually did was I took a bunch of rough notes as I was, I was chatting with Sully to pre to prepare for this, and I just started writing notes about what we might want this to look like, and it was just random notes, and I passed that into an agent. I passed it into Kiro's chat and said, uh, here's a bunch of notes. Can you turn this into a prompt that an agent would actually understand well? And it went and generated a prompt for me. And so like, like this is a technique that I'm, I, I've been using this a lot. I, I've been all the time I, I write things and then I ask the, the, the, um, the agent to write something better for the agent and then I give it to the agent. Often the agent does things. I mean how many guys, how many people have tried this? You write something, you give it to, to an agent, it doesn't you do what you want, and you ask the agent, why didn't you do what I want? How many people have done that? OK, how, how many people have instead asked what would have been more clear in my original message. Um, to have made you do that. OK, some, but not as many. I, I think these are really like, like this idea of meta prompting, I think is super important because you can like if you ask it in one way, the agent is going to respond in one way, and if you ask in a different way, it's gonna give you a different kind of advice. And so I use this all the time where I tell the agent, write this up in a way that is good for an agent. Tell me what was not clear about my prompt so that an agent would unders or or so that you would do it correctly the next time. And this doesn't always work, by the way, but sometimes I do that and it gives me all kinds of crazy ideas, and you try them out and they, and they don't work either, um, but, but I found this to be a more effective way to sort of iterate on your prompts. Um, OK, so checking in on here you can see it is adding a bunch of stuff to bedrock. You can see it's, it's succeeded in some CDK builds. Um, it is. It's going. Um, maybe time for another question while we wait for the, the agent to do its thing. You don't have any questions. Yeah, a couple of here. That gentleman. There you go. Then you, then you. So I noticed that you're using a lot, lots of mark down, saved copy pasting into the prompt. Um, how far is this away from just, you know, feeding those in and doing some like the spec driven flow instead? Would there be an advantage to doing that? Would there be an advantage to do the, to do this in a spec driven flow instead of with the markdowns, um. That's a good question. I, uh, I haven't tried that for this, uh, task. The one thing that I can say for not for this task, but for this approach, we also have some checklists. So this way what we can do is with the spectrum is open what we have is requirements acceptance. Criteria and the test and on the infrastructure decisions in here we keep this in a more MVP level, but we still have acceptance criteria. Our acceptance criteria here are our checklists. We wanna do some certain operations and we want them to succeed. This is basically our version of the specter in government, but if we have fed this into cure to create tasks, it would have taken our checklist as the acceptance criteria in the requirements filed itself. Thank you. I have a very simple question. Uh, you've used, uh, Quiro for the, uh, IDE. Was there a choice, uh, or can we use cursor or something else? Was there an advantage using Quiro? I haven't used it, so I'm asking. You could totally use, uh, uh, I, you could use anyone. I think the all, all the principles we're talking about, I think apply equally, whether you're using Quiro or cursor or co-pilot or a, um, or something like the QCLI, which is all on the command line which actually I use very often. Um, uh, just because I, I prefer using the command line, I go back and forth between that and Quiro, um, but the advantages, I mean, kind of to the earlier question, I think the spectrum and stuff is one of the differentiating things about Quiro, and it's true we're not actually using that here, um. But no My question is actually about the hot swap on the CDK deployment. So one of the things that I feel like we've had to somewhat like architect around is the combination of ECR and lambda, where if you deploy a new container with the same tag, lambda will not pick up that you've actually deployed a change if it's just tied to the tag, and I know it's not what the session's about, so feel free to punt if this doesn't work. Do you see people using that hot swap with lambda ECR combination in order to make the deployment simpler instead of having to do an update code as opposed to just saying maybe the the function changed, maybe the code changed, just deployed again? I, I don't, um. I don't know the answer to your question, but I would love to talk to you after the session to understand more because this is like I do work closely with that team, and I'd like to understand better, uh, the challenges you're seeing on that. Yeah, uh, you have, OK, I would like to see both of you in the session that you will talk to him as well. Yeah, sounds important. Yeah, we, we, we are lucky that we have Matt here to ask these questions so he can, he can consume them directly. Please go ahead. Go ahead, uh, just a quick question. You mentioned you're using, you know, agents to generate CDK code. Uh, I found with, with Bedrock, with anthropic models, chat GPT models that that. CDK code in TypeScript is is not very good. It's, it's consistently, you know, off from, from the newest changes in CDK. How do you, is there a certain prompt or certain tips you have that have helped you to try to generate that CDK code that it's, you know, is working correctly? Yeah, so, so you're saying, so you're saying that it's, it's off because the model has some outdated version of documentation that's not up to date with the latest stuff that is totally a pro, uh, a challenge, and that's what, what, what you were talking about as well, um, in, in my, um. So in, in, in the prompt that we did with this whole, the, the prompt I, I returned for you from the MCP, there's a lot of, uh, snippets that I put in there. So I, I've already put in snippets that I know are correct, um, which, which, you know, you have to know that if you're doing a one-off thing that might be more of a challenge, um, if I'm, I mean again this was a tool I built because I'm, I'm doing this a lot for a lot of different use cases right now and so like, you know, it, it worked well for me to do it that approach. Um, if it's behind on the documentation, so I actually a question for you, have you been using, uh, the AWS, um, there's an AWS e-documentation server that we launched, um, in, OK, um. I might have an answer to your question. Hold on just a minute, um. So, um We'll come back to more questions later. I, I wanna show you just because this deployment's finished. I want to you can see that it's deployed and if we hold on, let's go back to our, our app here it should have deployed to the same place if I refresh, um, I. I think I need to sign up again because there's not actually anything real here. OK, so we come in here and we're back at the AI system. um, let's ask a different question like what games do you recommend? In theory this is now integrated with Bedrock. And you can see it's taking longer, so it's doing something. Um, what are the chances that that this works? Is it actually gonna, you talk to Bedrock or is it gonna fail? Come on, huh, so you can see it's actually talked to Bedrock. It has told me, um, that. Uh, you can see that we're a fan of open world action adventure games, and they'd recommend checking out Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom for the Nintendo Switch. Sully, have you, have you done that one yet, or is that a, I already played, already played it, yeah, yeah, I already finished it off, you know, not the best recommendation, but, but we've now integrated with Bedrock. Um, OK, I wanna come back to, uh, your question, kind of, um, so. Uh, we just announced on Sunday a preview of what's called the AWBS MCP server. How many people have heard of that? Read that announcement? OK, a couple of people. So this, um, I'm gonna come back to, uh, to our MCP servers. I'm gonna disable, uh, my MCP server, and I'm gonna enable another one here that you see called AWS MCP. This is the, this is connecting to a remote MCP server that we just launched in preview on Sunday. Um, and what this does, this, this consolidates two features that we had launched previously and then adds a third one. So the two things that it launched that it consolidated were, um, integration with the AWS, uh, CLI. So it, it, it. It, it, it, it helps agents construct better commands to call um the, the AWBS CLI. Then there's the AWBS documentation which was which was remote just so, so the, the first one used to be local only. Now it's remote with this. The second one is this AWS um. Uh, knowledge, uh, those set of tools, and this was connecting to AWSO documentation and, and best practices and blogs and stuff like that. And so in answer to your question, if you're using that MCP server, I don't know if you were or not, it sounds like you weren't. So if, if, um, if you use that, I would love to know if you get different results because it should be connecting live to documentation and should be able to search for UCDK documentation and get better results. Um, I, I'd love to hear if that actually happens, but that's how, how what it should be doing. The third thing it's doing is, is, um, it, we've added a new type of functionality called SOPs, so standard operating procedures, and these are, uh, so everything we've walked through so far in this, um, in this talk are a bunch of prompts and step by step instructions for the model that we've created for this demo. Um, we, we as a team have also recently, and that's what's packaged in this, have curated a bunch of, uh, of, of, of these SOPs for y'all's, y'all to use, uh, so if we come over here, I'm gonna create a new session. Um, and I'm gonna say I'm gonna ask it what SOPs are available in your MCP? Um, I don't know if that's the best way to phrase that, but let's see what it says. It's going to, in theory, talk to this AWS retrieve agent SOPs. I need to trust it. So this is calling live the the thing that we just launched on Sunday and we're gonna see a bunch of useful things that uh that it can help the agent uh do so you can see that we can create an easy to instance profile set up we can create an Amazon Aurora DB cluster with. Instances we can do lambda gateway API which creates a rest API gateway and connects it to something to a lambda I guess, etc. etc. um, the one I was thinking about walking you through was um. Uh, creating cloud watch alarms. Which I, no, well, I'll give you guys a couple options. We can add cloud watch alarms. We could create a budget. We could lock down our S3 bucket to make it secure. Uh, we could try to add an Aurora database, which I think is gonna be the most complicated one, but we can try it. What, uh, I don't know. They'll shout out what sounds interesting. Alarms? OK, let's add alarms to our lambda function. Um, so it's thinking, uh, in theory it's going to. OK, so it found. What did it do here? ADS lambda. So it's, it is looking at the CD in the CDK infrastructure to understand what lambda functions we have. I don't know why it's calling lambda. OK, it it seems you have many lambda functions. I noticed there's a. What is it doing again this is vibe presenting, so don't know what we're doing. Uh, what is it doing? It is, so this is your lambda function. This is the, the bedrock, um. And the function here it is. Accepting edits. So if you look at the bedrock stack, I think it is actually generating some errors. So I guess it's generating errors, throttles, and durations. Um, it's building and deploying the changes. Uh, it's not following my deployment script, which is interesting. Uh, I mentioned that sometimes it doesn't do what you want. I built this, as I said, I built a, a deploy script so that it was deterministic, but that only works if the agent actually calls my script, which it decided not to do for some reason here. Um, I think it'll work anyway because I think. This command will still, I think it's 000 no sorry, it's building, it's building and it didn't yet make a mistake. I think we're OK. I think it also didn't read the deploy a script yet, so that's why right now it's not touching. Maybe it's the easier option for it to just do the CDK deploy so you can say I have the deploy SH. Is that? Yeah, well, no, no, it, it only built it. I, I, I, I was mis I was mistaken in what it was doing here. The this NPM run build is just building the changes, I think. And then, um, OK, so it's added 3 cloud was alarms to your bedrock stack, uh, so now we can deploy with. My with the or say let's say following guidance. In deployment. MD, that's the actual skill that we want it to use which tells it to go use the the deploy script. Um, And in theory this is gonna go and the place of while we wait for those changes. So you can see here I, I've been in, I, I don't know if y'all have noticed this, but it's actually committing on every change that we do. Um, the, these are instructions I've done that we have, there's, uh, um, different opinions on whether this is good or not. I like telling it to commit every time I, I tell it to, to do a change. You can see I've even asked it here to, um. Include the prompt that I gave it, uh, so that I can later go and look back at this and see what things worked and what things didn't work, um, but the reason I like that is because the the agent does something and then I might wanna undo what it did and get feels like a very common way to do that. Um, the only problem is that then I'm having incredible amounts to get commit to you that I have to go thank you, rebase them or whatever, um, but if we come over to, I was gonna go back and look at our Oh man, you have this set up differently than I do. Um, what I, what are you looking for? I wanna actually go and look at the changes. Uh, add cloud watch alarms. Here it is. OK, so, so, so I, I was just gonna go and inspect the changes it did. You can see here it did add cloud watch, and if we scroll down it has added this cloud watch alarm. Uh, to our CDK, so in theory that's gonna go and work, um, it's deploying it, um, and you know we, we can go log in and check out if that's working when it's done, but. I don't know, more questions, yeah, more questions, yeah. First him, then you, yeah, go ahead. AWS MCP also supports our terraform changes. Like most of our, like in my company, we use terraform heavily rather than CDK. Does A does AWS MCP support terraform changes? Um, this is a unique use case that, uh, if I want to add some alarms or anything in the future like budgeting and etc. will there be a possibility to have terraform also be baked in, or any changes can be passed on? Uh, it's a good cha it's a good question. And, and actually we can if you want. Uh, uh, I'm actually in order to answer your question, I'm going to go back to, so we said here let's add alarm to our, our lambda functions. What you can see here is here it called the MCP tool and you can actually see the respo. No, that's not right. Where's? Oh, this actually did. Did this, wait a minute. This didn't use our tool at all. I think it OK loaded in the beginning. I, I have demoed, I've demoed this MCP tool and I did not demo the piece of it that I wanted to demo. So what this actually did, it turns out again by presenting, um, what this actually did was it called. If you recall at the beginning I said that the MCP server had three things. There's the helping you call the CLI. There's the documentation, and there's the SOPs. What I was hoping this was gonna do was actually grab the SOP for adding alarms, um, which may or may not have specifically said use CDK. It, it, it might have actually said. Go call the CLI. It might have given more generic instructions which could then be applied to um the CDK or terraform or whatever the model decides, um, but what this actually ended up doing was it just went and looked at the CLI directly and just made just made up what what alarms it was gonna add. Um, so this might not have been the best demo of what I wanted to demo. It still shows how the MCP server works. It still shows that it, uh, it can go and make a bunch of cool calls, um, but let's, uh, let's see if we can prompt us to do something different. So we, we said, um, locking down the S3 bucket was one, right? Um, let's just add that. I, I know it didn't get as many votes, but we'll just do it so you guys can see. So, um. I'm also gonna be a little bit more explicit just for the sake of this demo and I'm gonna say use your uh. SOPs in the MCP tool to secure the S3 bucket of my static website. And let's see if this actually does something better and then we'll come back to this other question over here while we wait for it, um, OK, so you can see here it's actually done AWS retrieve agent SOP, and it's actually pulled in the SOP secure S3 buck buckets here. And so here it's gonna walk through a bunch of things, uh, you know, this provides a bunch of, um. Of information about here are the parameters of things you're gonna wanna do here's some constraints you must ask for all these parameters here's some steps that you're gonna go through it doesn't look like this one for example actually. No, this one is actually directing it to make, uh, um, CCI calls. So this might bypass the CDK goodness I was talking about here. Um, I don't know if the model is gonna recognize that this is, uh, a CDK and kind of veer from the SOP script or if it's gonna call the CLI anyway, but we'll, we'll see what that is. I, I presume if it doesn't say CDK and it figures it out it would do the same thing for terraform, but, but that's, this is me speculating and, and. And your mileage may vary. Um OK, so it, it's going through that while we're waiting for that, um, I think we have another question over there. Uh, wait, sorry, uh, what models are available? How the billing is happening, and is there an Amazon and house model exist for for, for code writing? OK, so I didn't we catch the question. Was the question which, uh, lately which model we're using? Yeah, in, in Qro, what are the models available and what are, how are the pricing works and so on. And uh, if, uh, Amazon and house model exist at all. Of code writing I can take this if you want. Yeah, so from the model's perspective we have Sonnet 4.5, Sonet 4, and we have the Opus 4 4.5, which is the latest one I think and. We don't have an Amazon in point, uh, in-house model here. We have an Amazon model. Uh, we have, for example, Titan, which is specified in tech stuff and so on you can use, but for coding we don't have that. These models are powered by Amazon Bedrock. The infrastructure of the models come from Amazon itself. The pricing is with curious's pricing, it depends on which model that you use. The most expensive one is the Opus, but you can use, for example, Haiku 4.5, which is the cheapest one, or you can use the auto mode that will, for example, for a conversation will pick the Haiku for a hard task. It will pick Opus. We have a free tier of let's say like 50 credits, but according to what you do, according to your task, it does a different calculation. You, we have ways to see it within the ID so you can check out what operation would cost, how much, uh, tokens out of it. I can say, for example, I can say for authentication you will have 5, but maybe it's something simple, maybe it's 2, or maybe it's complicated, or 7. But you can observe it as well. One thing about Quiro is it is independent. Like you can keep it independent from your AWS billing as well. So you, in case you wanna try out, download it. We will share the QR code later on as well with you and just sign in with your Google account and just try out the free tier as well. So technically. Uh, it's, you have option to not do it. You can also connect it as well. No, no, no, you don't need it. We don't have also bring your own key stuff as well. We have 1 minute left. We, we have 1 minute and a half, yeah, yeah. I don't think we're gonna have enough time to actually, so you can see here that we've actually, uh, it's, it's gone through this SOP. It, it's, uh, it's recog it, it said that it's already pretty secured, which is pretty good, um, and it sounds like it's got a couple of, uh, small things that it would like me to do. No, it says no additional changes necessary. OK, well, I guess we don't have to wait for deployment, which is good because we don't have time anyway, um, but, uh, I hope this was at least we'll give you guys a teaser of, um, of what the, the, the AWS MCP server can do, uh, and you know we're gonna provide some links. Uh, yes, I'll let you do that, but let's showcase, um, like. OK, I said we have one slide, but we have one more than one. This is, these are the resources like for CDK. This is the CDK documentation. Kiro for the folks who has not heard about it. They can download it from kiro.de and AWSMCP, uh, documentation is the last one, so you can check it out, get it to any agent ID or any code companion that you have to work with. They are working great. Besides that, like we were afraid we would not make it in time, but we actually talked a lot, so I'm really happy we are just in time. Thank you, uh, not this one, this one, this is. So, uh, I wanna thank you all for staying here, listen to us, and actually like being part of this experience with us, and I, I hope y'all learned something, um, and I'm curious to learn from y'all as well about, uh, the things you're struggling with. So thank you everyone.
