Welcome everyone. We're gonna be, uh, talking about scaling AIs scale trusted AI adoption with Salesforce and AWS. My name is Shibani Ahuja, and I am one of your hosts today, uh, but I'm joined by 4 gentlemen, 3 gentlemen here. We've got Amit, uh, Bangga, uh, director go to market applications from CrowdStrike. Welcome, Rushi, principal solution architect from AWS, and we got Praveen, who's the managing director from Deloitte Consulting over here. So good spread, and I am Shivani. I work at Salesforce, and I'm gonna start with a small story of what my role at Salesforce is, but before I do. A love letter from our lawyer, from Salesforce, to say, please make all of your purchasing decisions on all of the products that are readily available today. Not on any future looking products that you might see. obligated to say that. I try to say it in a way with love. Three things we're gonna talk about today. So one, the first part is I'm gonna take you down, um, a few trends that I've seen of CIOs and folks that are implementing AI and this whole notion of AI and what we've, what we've seen in, uh, what I've seen in the industry as far as trends have gone along in the, in the, in the first I'd say for the last year. The second one is we're gonna go a little bit deeper on this partnership that we have between Salesforce and, and. Um, AWS, because a lot of folks ask that question to say, wait, aren't you, are you competitors? Are you partners? How do you partner? I'd love to learn more about that. And then the last one is where it's gonna get a lot of fun, where we're, I'm gonna be able to, to grill and interrogate these three guys on stage over here. We'll learn more about the success that CrowdStrike has had in becoming an agentic enterprise. We'll also leave open time for Q&A. So think about all of those really hard, juicy personal questions that you wanna ask these gentlemen over here. I'll help facilitate that as well. OK, so what I'm gonna start with is a small introduction of who I am and why on earth am I on stage here, uh, besides the fact that Salesforce is sponsoring this event and I happen to work at Salesforce now, a year ago, however, I was not working at Salesforce. I was sitting in your seat. I was, uh, working at one of the largest banks in Canada and I was driving a massive technological transformation thing called personalization, um, also for a little bit, I was at TD Bank. And for a portion of time I also ran all of digital for the Canadian bank, um, so I knew a thing or two about working with Salesforce, um, and so what happened was part of my remit, uh, was the Salesforce stack amongst many other technologies as we were driving digital and creating these personalized experiences for customers, and Salesforce is notorious for wanting to put customer stories on stage a little bit like what we're doing here, where if they've had a success with a customer, they invite them to come up, tell their story. So I was working at TD Bank. I got this invite from, uh, Salesforce to say, hey, we have, Salesforce has this internal conference. It's for Mark Benioff and his top leaders, like 450 SVP plus will be in the room. Um, and the 73,000 colleagues will be dialing in. It's like an internal employee thing. Would you come in and will you tell your story about what you drove at TD with personalization with data 360? And I said, sure, no problem. And they said it's in Hawaii, and I went, Oh, if I must. So off I go. I fly to Hawaii and I'm sitting there. They're asking me questions about the transformation. Say you know how did you use data 360, all the, all the typical questions that they would ask to, to entice and incentivize their sales teams at the end I was asked one question and that question was, Shuwani, you've got Mark who's sitting as far as you are, uh, in the audience. You've got his top leadership here. What advice do you have for them? Now what you'll learn throughout today is I have zero filter and I let it rip like I mean I made it a stand-up comedy show. I said, you know, you guys are like a timeshare you like set us up with really, really nice dinners, but we have to listen to someone talk about sales for 45 minutes and maybe we'll get a nice dinner out of it and we might get a gift and, and I kind of went on and on. Not about what my experience was and I said it's ironic that you're helping me put my customer at the center to drive personalization at scale. Yet when I show up for a meeting with you, you bring 22 people, and I have to know who's sales cloud, who's marketing cloud, who's service cloud, and I went like this is not how you do business. And so, uh, you know, when you're, when you're on a roll and you know that you should stop, but you just can't stop, that was what it felt like. And so then I finally stopped. And Mark stands up and he's a towering guy and I'm very, very short and he shakes my hand and I get a standing ovation. I'm like, OK, so I'm not being escorted out this is good news as I am walking out of the venue, someone, someone says watch out, they're coming for you and I think before I even got back to Toronto, which is home base for me. I had gotten the call to say hey Shivani, you've got a lot of opinions on how we engage with the office of the CIO and with our shift now to AI and agentic and autonomous and agent force, you know, we'd really like your help in helping us better understand our customer and so now I'm at Salesforce and I'm leading my my title is a bit vague ultimately I'm leading our go to market strategy for how we. Engage CIOs and these are enterprise level CIOs because we just don't do it right or we hadn't done it right and we weren't necessarily seen as a as a serious player in the AI space and so we've been doing a lot, a lot of CIO events. What ended up happening was I joined um and I do a lot of speaking. I, I share all of this because in the last year and I just hit my one year anniversary on November 18th with Salesforce, I have met. With over 457 enterprise CIOs, and these are not just high shaking hands, but these are deep conversations through one to many engagement events where I may be either meeting with them one on one and helping them, uh, guide them on their strategy of what, where they wanna go, how they wanna get there, or just general education on not necessarily products and, and, and sales, but what, what this, this era that we're in. And the number one insight that I've seen as we are going through this technological revolution, the number one insight is that AI is the smallest, biggest word and what I mean by that is I can't tell you how many conversations I'm having with CIOs or I'll be in a room with tech leaders, it could be anyone, tech leaders, and you'll have like the sales team here, you'll have tech leaders here, you'll have data folks here, and everyone is using the word AI everyone, good, that's good, that's the conversation we wanna have, but if you listen very carefully. One person may be talking about predictive AI. Another person talking about generative AI. Another person thinking they're talking about agentic AI. And if you listen to the words really carefully, they're literally just describing generative AI. And so that was a massive aha for me to say like I don't know how well people are being prepared to think about architectures of the future. If they haven't really paused for a moment to really fundamentally think about the architectural differences between generative AI versus agentic AI, and then you know that that study hits that MIT study that creates a lot of noise around 95% of of of uh pilots are failing to deliver value. Well, it's ungenerative, that's not on agentic. So this is just the setup and, and what's happening is so these CIOs are having these conversations, they're rushed to try to get a use case in production. And now all of a sudden what's happened is it's not unlike the Internet or cloud or even mobile, the CIO was squarely in charge and was delivering this for the organization. Now suddenly with every board member and every CEO having access to chat GPT thinking they are an AI expert, they're going, I need a use case in production. I need a story to tell my investor. Investors, I need to get something in production. Their, their business leaders are putting this pressure. Suddenly these leaders are under immense pressure to just get a use case in production, and they're going through these thoughts to say, Should I build? Should I buy? Should I, what's, what's the use case that I should get in? And as one thing that I've seen in terms of maturity and again in in a year in this maturity I've only really seen in the last 2 to 3 months is as people pause and recognize the difference between generative architecture versus agentic architecture that would enable a digital agent to traverse the virtual halls of your organization, I'm seeing the shift of build versus buy conversation that also evolved a little bit. And it's changing from one of should I build from scratch, and I kind of I would, I would giggle when someone said I'm gonna build my genic architecture from scratch going like do you really know what that means? That's a lot. So it's shifting from build to buy from that to now talking about. Should I be going with a SAS provider? Should I be going with a, uh, a cloud service provider? And so this has really been the conversation of what is it that you're trying to build? What are you trying to drive, understanding the core differences between predictive, generative, and ergentic, and I'll give a moment because I love it when I see cameras out to take pictures and I'll, I'll flip the slide as soon as you've got those. OK, good picture it's like popcorn. I wait for the popcorn to stop popping. Perfect. And so now this is giving rise to another conversation to say, should I, should I go with the SAS provider? With the SAS provider I can build at scale. I can build it or I can build at speed. They're gonna provide me templates. It's gonna be grounded in my business logic. So you think about the Salesforce platform, we have all of your customer data. So theoretically being able to create agents that are leveraging your customer data, it's in a clean spot. That'll be a fast way to do it, um, and they're gonna be ready-made with guardrails because Salesforce already has all the guardrails that are built within the system. But then you've got another cohort of folks that say, well, Salesforce is kind of like a CRM company. My COO, my CMO cares about them. I'm not really gonna look at Salesforce for agentic agents, and you've got those that are thinking, I'm gonna go with this, uh, a hyper scaler, a cloud service provider. They're gonna give me the option, the, the options to choose my models. Like, I'm gonna be able to build custom agents that I really need and want throughout my organization and with customer security architecture. And this is where we're starting to see more stories like the one we're gonna share with you today is there is a world where both could exist, and that is a world where you start to look at partnerships, the better together story of Amazon or AWS and Salesforce coming together. Where you can start to take all of that rich data that you have on customers, be able to, to harmonize that, create agents that operate with context. You've got model options. So again, as a customer, I also, I often thought, uh, Salesforce is like a beast, beast. It's a monolith. They want me to put everything in it. They want to be at the end all be all, but the reality is choose your lake, choose your warehouse, choose your model, choose your partner. And so there's been a lot more of that aha moment where folks are going, I didn't realize that I could do this and this to bring it together, being able to create a unified agent strategy, being able to create these multi-agent ecosystems and all with the trusted guardrails that are extended beyond just the Salesforce ecosystem and the AWS ecosystem, and the partnership benefits are well beyond even what you're seeing just here on slide. That's really what I wanted to share and really about talking about CrowdStrike, how CrowdStrike is now an agentic enterprise that has taken this leap forward with both Salesforce and AWS to start creating these agents that are gonna operate at scale, and it's with that partnership and the Salesforce agent Agent Force 360 platform that they've been able to get context, clarity, the richness that's necessary, and the safety and security and guardrails for those agents to operate at scale. All right, now chapter 2. I'm gonna hand this off to Rushi, my friend, who's gonna tell us and go a little bit deeper on that partnership between AWS and Salesforce. Thank you, Shibani. Good afternoon. I'm principal solutions architect AWS, and I think, I think since the last few months I've been working very closely with. The product and engineering team at Agent Force specifically uh help guide on the model optionality and the agent interoperability integrations on AWS. So these are the two key topics of today's session. So let's dive in. Now. Before I get into the further part of it, I want to bring the first thing is that for building any agentic enterprise you need a trusted data to fuel your AI agents, and by this time you must have known looking at the agent 360 that Agent Force works on this trusted data. It runs on this trusted data. Now we, as we have established that trusted contextual data is critical for any agent to work, the next logical question comes is how about giving the empowerment for the users to choose their preferred AI models when it is like if you look at an agent, agent is powered by the LLMs or the back end models. So to do that, Salesforce just launched, uh, I think 2 months ago, support for anthropic, uh, cloudstone model on Bedrock. This enables the joint customers or our cus customers to keep the data within the Salesforce trust boundary. Right, and this helps actually specifically when it comes to Uh, thinking about the models which we use here, you will make sure that the data never leaves the trusted boundary right now that we have kind of, uh, if you look at the various, uh, LLM flexibility we have here in the prom builder in the reckless reasoning engine, we can send a bunch of models from the Amazon Bedrock. So with LLM flexibility our customers can now build, have a, I would say rather maximum control on their security when building the agentic enterprise. So now that we talked about the unified data strategy or the model choices for powering your AI agents, now let's think about taking this digital labors to the next level, like coming up with a unified agent strategy and how do you do that? So this is done through the way uh if you think about. There are agent force now actually supports the agent could say multi-agent orchestration and multi-agent orchestration is possible through few things, right? So one of the thing is that if you as a customer in order to build, you know, an agentic enterprise using Salesforce and AWS what. You have to think about here is that the agent force with MCP client support can now talk to the MCP servers provided by AWS and plus the AWS MCP servers are also made available on the Salesforce agent exchange which helps you to deploy your agents rapidly in a production environment. Right, so this way I mean if you look at the other options which it has is the agent to agent collaboration. So agent to agent interoperability is based on sales forces or you could say agent forces open agent colla collaboration which is based on the standard protocol called as A2A. That helps the sales force agents or the agents for agents to talk to any other agents. So here what we have shown is that you can talk to an agent sitting on Bedrock Agent Corre. Bedrock Agent Corre Run time is one of the several less managed service from AWS to run and scale your agents. You can talk to those agents or you can. Talk to any third party agents and also coming up in very recently we can think about is also the the tools which the other agents can call assuming that the agent force agent is as a tool so they can call those tools through the agent core gateway that will help you to route the tool traffic to the agent force agents. So with that let me pass it on to Shibani and to our amazing CrowdStrike customer, a leading security provider, and energetic Enterprise now. Perfect. Thank you. Alright, so this is the part where we're just gonna get into conversation and I'm, I'm short, so I'm gonna like lean up so you can see me over there, um, we're a few slides more. Sorry, what's that? You can click a few slides more, yeah, yeah, um, so we're gonna talk about CrowdStrike. CrowdStrike is an is an agentic enterprise and to, to, to ask and get deeper into those questions of how did they become that agentic enterprise? What were the aha moments that they went through as they were becoming that agentic enterprise, and think about the questions that you have. I have a couple of questions that I've got that is that are warm-ups. But this is an opportunity for you to learn from your peers and from those that are on the stage, both from an implementation, a partner, a platform SAS provider, and our customers' point of view. Um, the first question that I'm gonna ask you is not on the script at all. What's your guilty pleasure? So, and as you are, as you are, uh, introducing yourself, so maybe as you're answering the question, give a small intro of your role. Awesome, yeah, guilty pleasure. What is it? So my guilty pleasure is chocolates, chocolates, OK. And dark chocolate specifically, so I'm totally up for it any time during the day, during the night, so that's my guilty pleasure. So briefly introducing about myself, uh, I'm Ahmed Bangit, director for, uh, go to Mar applications at CrowdStrike. Um, I have been part of CrowdStrike for close to 3 years. I've been part of this ecosystem of Salesforce and go to Market Systems. For more than 15 years, um, at CrowdStrike currently I, uh, manage that platform and I'm primarily in this context responsible for building those high value agents, uh, which not only bring operational efficiency but also reimagine the complete end to end process when it comes to Asian tech enterprise. Amazing. Thank you. Guilty pleasure, yeah, go for it. I think electronic gadgets, electronic gadgets, any, any in particular, specifically laptops, laptops, OK. Do you know, as a kid my dad and I, every time Sony would release something, MP3 player, laser disc, we'd be the first to get it. So I get it. I get that, I mean obsession. My son was behind buying, buying a gaming laptop, so he was thinking about, hey, what's your budget? I said, no, let's, let's look at the specification and then think about it. So that's all I meant, yeah. But yeah, I mean I have introduced myself. Um, I've been with AWS around 6 years now, um, and I've seen a lot of AML startups and ISPs I've worked with. I'm not happy to, you know, give my insights into how things work here, what questions you have good to understand that and explain it to you. Great, Vivien guilty. OK, so I, I was gonna use one of the guilty pleasures which was already used. So I'm gonna switch to the other one that I got. I think it's anything and everything around Indian food. Indian. Oh yeah, really. So if I go out, that seems so healthy. Yeah, I know. Like I give you my guilty pleasure. I'll tell you how it's done. My daughter keeps telling me that I need to start losing weight and then how I should not eat a lot of Indian food, but as you. Imagine that's what's your favorite Indian food so I know when next time you come over what I'm making. Yeah, I, I think so that my favorite Indian food is anything which is spicy and non-vegetarian like chicken or goat. Got it, noted. Yeah. So as a quick introduction, uh. I'm managing director in Deloitte. As part of my role, I, I primarily focus on like helping my clients with like business transformation engagements, which are focused on not only just driving the operational efficiencies, but like truly driving like revenue growth for my clients, right? And as, as we do that, I've been working with the Salesforce plus AWS ecosystem for a good part of like, I guess 1516 years now. And prior to that, I was also working with the go to market systems. I used to. Help with implementation around like one of the old CRM solutions called CIBil if you guys have heard about it. Uh, and internally at Deloitte I also lead our what we call as a customer 360 practice and considering like everything around AI and then everything that we have discussed about like how data becomes the fuel and the food for AI that has been one of the core areas that I've been focusing on helping clients, getting on that strong foundation that can help them scale, uh, their AI journey. Great. OK, so my guilty pleasure, let me tell you, since you all are so innocent, bourbons and burger. So I, I'm coming from Canada where if you aren't aren't aware there's no more bourbon on our shelves because of, you know, for whatever reason there may be. So as I, uh, every time I cross the border I make sure that, uh. I get my share of bourbons and burgers. Which brand is your favorite? Wood well, Woodford is good for every day, yeah, for the, for the everyday. OK, now to get into the tough stuff, Amitth. Tell us about your team. Why is AI so important to your organization? What are you driving, yep. Um, so I lead a team of, uh, a combination of engineers, testers, analysts, product owners, architects, so that's my team, but what's really important here is, uh, whom do we support, right? So we support our business internal business teams across marketing, across sales, across customer success, legal, finance, product, etc. Beyond this, we also build tech solutions for our customers and partners to use on their respective portal. So AI is not only important for us, it's basically, it's a foundation of how we think about our three S's, right? So which is speed, scalability, as well as, uh, um, I mean, speed, scalability, and strategy. So added score really AI helps us to um think faster. Understand faster, so understanding the customer behavior, that's one, then beyond customer behavior, the internal inefficiencies, right? So AI can surface this information with speed and it's basically like thousands of analysts working for you and surfacing information, um, which otherwise would not come to the forefront, right? Beyond this, AI also helps you to ask, uh, basically act smarter, I would say. Um, be it your mundane day to day, uh, routine task that you're automating or be it complex workflow simplification, AI helps you to focus the focus and channelize the human energy where it matters the most in building relationships and, um, um, uh, in building relationships, then, um, um, also, um, just the experience, right? Um, beyond this, I would say not just tech, but AI is a game changer, right? So AI is a cultural shift, so it's super important for us. Sounds like you've got a, a good balance between where you're focusing on colleague enablement but also customer engagement, customer experiences, and it's important when organizations are thinking about it from both sides of the house because it creates those more holistic. rounded use cases throughout the organization. That makes sense. Thanks so much. All right, Rishi. Oh, that's uh the Salesforce trust boundary. Why is that a non-negotiable requirement? I'll start with a very serious note that when it comes to security and compliance of our customers' data, both Salesforce and AWS take them as priority number one. Right, so enterprises basically trust us and when it comes to like a trust boundary they want an absolute whether it is like a user prompt or the intermediary workflow where the agentic AI workflow is trying to process the data or the final AI response all has to be done or none has to be actually uh cross that trusted boundary, right. So together actually both I mean AWS and Salesforce designed and built a solution that meets the data residency and compliance requirements for our customers globally across 22 regions and we're counting I guess right? so 24 or maybe something like that but the key thing here is that the customers wherever the customers operate from, no matter I mean world we are making sure that and we're assuring that your data remains within the trusted boundary that you have established with Salesforce. So trust boundary really in um data residency and ensuring the safety, security, stability of that data but also as you start to provision that data access to to agents is ensuring that you've got the consistency, uh, particularly I think about it in a world where you start to think of agents that are talking to other agents and how to ensure that same trust boundary across it's, it's both I would say it's both north south and east west, for example, agent to agent or agent to models so you have to keep, make sure that your customers' data are secure. Compliant. Right, thank you. OK, one more for you. Oh yeah, and you got the cheat sheet right there. So the, uh, the integration, I'm not gonna, you've got this. How does the integration with Amazon Bedrock ensure compliance for our joint customers? So I'll start with first Amazon Bedrock, right? Amazon Bedrock provides you the secure connectivity to the frontier models like Anthropic cloud, Amazon NA, and others through a technology called as Private link which which makes the, the entire application to talk to these models privately within the private network of AWS, right? And certainly I mean uh like if you look at the agent force there are two modules which we talked about the prom builder as well as the the reasoning engine, and these modules typically use agent force uh if you look at these modules, these are using the Amazon Bedrock's models, right? Anthropic clot. For reasoning engine, and there's a bunch of models within Amazon Bedrock like the Cloud Haiku, Opus, Sonnet, as well as Amazon Noa Noa Lite, NoA Pro. They are used in the prompt Builder. If you have used prompt Builder, that will give you model optionality. So depending on customer's preference, Agent Force also supports a feature called as in-country inference profile of bedrock, which lets, which I would say which restricts the data to remain within the country where you're doing influencing or you're running the agentic AI applications, right? So I would say the compliance rests on these three pillars. One is your secure connectivity to the model. Second is no data at rest. The third is, depending on the customer preference, they can pick and choose the in-country influencing so that the data never leaves the country boundary. Perfect. I like, I'd love to do a quick poll just to see how many of you are, uh, Salesforce customers. I would imagine that you all are AWS customers. Or it might be easier to say who are who who in the crowd is not a Salesforce customer like this would, would this be news is this something that is coming as news to you that ah there is a partnership again like as a as a customer. Salesforce didn't necessarily do the greatest job at the onset of talking about how open extensible uh adaptable the the stack was and it was it took a bit of finally convincing and getting time with the with the reps to say OK I didn't realize that that there was we could choose a model let alone from a library of models through partnerships like this I like this is pretty important for the. That are starting to explore and understand and really understanding how Atlas Reasoning works where Atlas Reasoning is not the model it's the one that helps to choose what is the right model fit for purpose based on guardrails that a customer establishes. Yeah, I would say it's a true multi tenant environment. I mean agent forced to scale to these multi-tenant requirements of model optionality. I mean, uh, tool optionality and other things it's really, um, based on your own requirements. I mean these tenants have given those requirements to us, yeah, yeah. OK, Amit, what are your primary drivers that made you choose Anthropicon Bedrock? On agent force, there would have been a plethora of options. Why this combination? Yeah, I think we had three primary drivers. One is the data residency and compliance in general. This model ensures that the data stays within the salesforce managed trust boundary and it does not leave the trust boundary, which is critical for organizations with strict data compliance requirements like such as ours. That's one. Um, second driver is, uh, in general, the security, uh, the security first architecture from Cloud, right? So Claude is known for a constitutional AI which emphasizes a lot on transparency, on safety, and less hallucination risk. Um, this just gives another layer of reliability index for us. So that's driver number 2 and, uh, third. Key driver is meeting people where they are like for example in Salesforce in Slack, right, um, when deployed via Agent Force Cloud actually runs on Salesforce Infra which offers tight control over the prompt execution as well as the model behavior. So those were our key drivers, yeah, and there's a lot of native integrations I think ultimately is what you're wrapping it around is to say this is again how the the conversation. that evolved with a number of CIOs over the course of the year to say I'm no, no, no, no salesforce I'm gonna build I'm gonna build shop to then recognizing hang on a second, what exactly do you think that you're building when you think about all the individual tiles that are necessary to build the genetic architecture to then exactly what you're describing is this, you know, I really wanna think of a partner that's gonna have native integration, someone that's gonna do the work for me, someone that I've already got the stack that is constantly upgrading, updating, and. Identifying the stack that I have and building those partnerships and so all the more reason that we really wanted to show up to make sure that people really recognize that we've got this better together story now. I know I've got a I've got, I've got more questions, but I also wanna open it up to the crowd because we can, we can mix it up with the crowd and then go back to the questions that I've got. Is there any questions that we've got in the audience? Yeah, OK, I don't know if we've got a mic runner or if you want to just yell it out. Yeah, um, so on the question of the, of multi-model and the ability to choose your model, yeah. I guess 11 alternative here is. Then drop those. For. How, you know, But what I don't understand, and we've been kind of looking a little bit at the sales post and I and so. Um, I'm trying to understand how, you know, you've trained obviously on something. Whatever your existing cats. We've got David sitting, you know, In the Salesforce But we're making a choice of a different model. How, how is that model operating against the In your environment That I cannot re So I'll, I'll take this up. I mean there are two types of, uh, machine learning techniques here. One is on the predictive models where the models are trained on your data which is in the sales force which you are training themselves to give some predictions or some kind of uh, uh, attritions or some forecast, right? That is a different aspect. This is an agenttic aspect in the agenttic world. The agent is a set of instructions or you could say user context and the user query, right? Uh, that orchestration is using a backend LLM, and the back end LLM nowadays are so powerful that you don't have to train with the customers' data. The LLMs can make and decide based on the user query. Let's say if someone wants to take a time off and they want to go and call multiple tools for that, so that that intelligence is in the model that if a query comes with this particular agent instruction context, then what tools I should be calling to complete that particular task. So that way, so to commit to your point, the models which are behind the choices which we are giving those models for, those are the frontier models which are quite intelligent to come up with the workflow given the right instruction, right context. That context, that cluster data is what Salesforce is providing as part of the in-flight data to the model. It's nothing to do with that models are trained or not. The thing which are surely is coming in the middle are the trust layers, right? So those models are trained for specific toxic detection or prompt injection. Those are something it has to be a proprietary models, but coming to your point, the model optionalities for those LLMs which are giving these workflows and the other thing that I would say is again that's coming in now is this this. Idea that you don't necessarily want nondeterministic responses and so this the, the ability to have adaptive reasoning and to be able to put in parameters against those models and against the instructions where you want a finite and definitive response versus where you do want the LLM to be able to to reason to to think to consider what the response options should be. Let me expand it. Yeah, and, and if folks we're gonna, uh, once the question asked, we'll just make sure that everyone can hear if not whoever's taking the answer can if you take the same concept and talk about, you know, company data which helps you. Truth of we know what the fact is, and not training the other way by using that as economical fact. But changing the choice of the number, right, you could be on a deep. tomorrow. Changes the perception or changes the response of what you may have spent. month to a year, right now you're changing because there's Better model, cheaper model where it's, it's performing well and it's, you know, more data sufficient than the other one is. So you see some incremental gains with that, but there's a whole lot of Pipeline building work that needs to happen. I think that's where we got we're part of the same thing. So this is where we interaction with Salesforce could not wrap our head around to say how are you guys solving this, and we never were able to have that clapping. Yeah, so I mean, by the way, I mean we have a sorry, sorry, just quick question, did the folks on the ends of the room hear it? OK, can you got the question clearly? Yeah, paraphrasing the the question. Yeah, so the question was about. Yeah, when you're building this gentic AI system, a local, local environment, right? How are you giving model optionality without making big workflow or pipeline changes because every other model has a different tone, different, different way of responding to a particular request, right? Uh, so what, so I mean I will not uncertain deep, but there is a session on that ISV 309. Please do come on that part, um, but the thing is that it's all possible because of, because Salesforce thought this way ahead and they built all these things so modular and have having a different. Or complete dedicated data scientist team also helps a lot. So this is, I mean, combination of these two being modularity, bring some adapter level things which you can always choose the target model even when you're describing the agent actions or descriptions, right? If you make it AI assisted, that makes it easier for the target model to interpret. Alright, we'll go back to some of the questions we have. Think as this this is hopefully prompting you to think of other questions that you've got within your own environment or just even broader questions on what we talked about in the earlier parts. OK, Ravin, so what is the most tangible business impact clients are seeing when they implement AgentForce and AWS? Yeah, I think that that's a good question, uh, but before I get to the exact response. Let me take a step back, right? If you If we rewind back, like say 12 to 18 months, or maybe even like 8 to 12 months now. Every AI and GNII conversation that was happening in, uh, like at least the conversations that I was having with my clients was essentially dominated by like a DIY thinking like I want to do it myself, right? Like uh there was a there was a lot of concern around like security, the compliance and what it is at risk, right? Uh, now fast forward to today and if you think about it, the landscape has changed drastically. Uh, now the clients, for them, the focus is more on, like, obviously the cost, but more important than that is time to value. Am I able to deliver something to my stakeholders which can really drive the value for them? And with that context, now the lot of clients have started reevaluating what is feasible and that reevaluation is leading to like, hey, maybe there is, obviously we all knew like most folks in this room probably knew that like doing it yourself or like building everything in-house is not the smartest and uh and never has been the fastest way to get the value. Because there are like these big players like AWS and Amazon, they are investing heavily, uh, in the innovation and coming up with all these frameworks, interconnectivity and all those things, and that make a huge, huge difference. So now there is a lot more appetite for our customers to consider this like very credible alternatives. That can drive the value, while also getting them, like, giving them the trust boundaries and the frameworks that can, they can use for scaling it at a, at a pace that that can drive the value for their business. So, where are we right now and what I'm seeing from my customers? Uh, I would say like there are like 3 or 4 things that I would call out. But number 1 theme is about like, time to value, like faster time to value. Like, am I able to deliver something for my cust stakeholders, which can drive the immediate value. And then the other thing that is like the key thing that is really originating from all of this is we started with like a lot of like point AI use cases, right? I want to like we almost started like thinking about like automation in the agentic sense like what we used to do historically as the automation of like predictive things and then that's what we call that like a. Agentic behavior, but now it has become more like, hey, I can reason with it, right? And I'm, I'm able to drive this value and then I can do this at a scale and at a speed which my teams can like literally deploy some of the AI infused capabilities or features for a particular subset of the group in days or weeks as compared to months and years that we had to do it. That's number one thing. I think the second theme that I would talk about is operational efficiencies. As, and I think this goes back to that automation concept, right? What has happened is like the mundane tasks that we used to do, and those are repetitive tasks, a lot of clients are like essentially evolving towards like, hey, these are the things that I don't have to have my resources spend a lot of time on that. I want to free up my teams to do more strategic work that can truly lead to my like revenue growth. And then the third thing that I would say. is around like, uh, essentially cost optimization of like doing some something like this, while also having the flexibility and agility to scale in different areas where you want to scale. So I would probably stop there with 3. There are a lot of other things that I can talk about, but those are like the top 3 themes and the real benefits that clients are clients are seeing. And there are clients who are like really making that like shift, like it's almost like a tectonic ship now, right, where you, you, you're like very concerned and you're like, hey, should I do it or not? What if it goes wrong to a point where, hey, I want to do it. Tell me how to do it the right way. And what you've talked about is specifically like from a use case perspective value time to value efficiency effectiveness experience risk and control. I think the partnership brings so many more benefits uh in the how you also do it whether it is the fact that you can now purchase Salesforce through AWS Marketplace like. It's not just the what that you're implementing, it's the how it's that there is an agent ecosystem or the agent exchange where you've got agents that you can now, uh, get that are pre-built, um, through AWS and through Salesforce together so it's a lot of the what and how I'd say. Yeah, I would agree, and I think like what and again just going back to like what has really fueled this tectonic shift is like this powerful alliances and the partnership and the interconnectivity between different platforms. Obviously we are talking about Salesforce and AWS yet, but the similar thing is happening with like Salesforce, Google Cloud, like there is a Microsoft doing their own thing. So all these big platforms are like come together and they have forged these partnerships because now everybody is realizing that like hey. You can't really do it all by yourself. Doesn't matter how big you are, whether you're Amazon, Google, or like, uh, Apple. Like everybody is realizing there is a need to partner and collaborate with each other. But here the partnership is most important in Salesforce and A for sure, for sure. I, I agree. I have not heard about that. I didn't hear anyone else. I didn't hear any other name in that response. Um, Amit, what, uh, what governance factors are important to you when you're choosing to deploy Agent Force on AWS? Yeah, so, uh, beyond just security there are 3 key governance factors for us. Uh, one is control, then compliance, and then finally collaboration as well. Um, yeah, the 3 C's is, uh, easier, right? The 3 C's. So, um, when it comes to compliance, first of all, right, so, uh, a, yeah, um, this model basically contains the traffic, the LLM traffic within the virtual private. A cloud of salesforce, right, so the data is isolated. It does not leave the private environment, um, couple it with data isolation and uh the policy of cloud to not retain any data, it just helps us to know. I mean it just improves the compliance posture for us to know that this data is not being used to train the model model itself, so it's added layer of privacy, um, that's like one area. Um, second is, uh, when it comes to control, um, it, this model also gives us access to the command center, right? So with command center, uh, we can control and we can also monitor agents real time for their performance, especially, um, their error rates, right, or their escalation paths. So this is super important for us, um. Beyond this, the third aspect is obviously collaboration, right? We talked a bit about agent to agent, right? So agent collaboration is very real. So, uh, agent build on agent force, um, is expected to collaborate with the agent build with a totally different LLM and, totally different ecosystem seamlessly. So basically this model checks all the boxes for us and, uh, um, you know, uh. With the use of A2A as well as uh uh you know, MCP protocol, um, this absolutely helps us, right? so it fits right well into your enterprise strategy, great, great, and you, you talked about command center going on to a small tangent for a moment like the command center you talked about it, but like the importance of it again as as CIOs or uh tech leaders would think about build versus buy, these are the things that they wouldn't think about necessarily to say. Am I also gonna build the the interface that is gonna allow me to test if I'm building it from scratch that's gonna enable me and allow me to test it or the interface that allows me to do, you know, I think about an agent uh so generative being a co-pilot, something that's sitting on the side that's helping me. I type it and it helps me do something with the copilot with the with agentic being like a colleague, a virtual colleague that's traversing the halls of my organization. Now, when I joined Salesforce, I needed all the things that this agent needs, including the quarterly check-ins that are happening post 1 year in the job, and that command center acts as a bit of that quarterly check-in to say is this digital worker performing the way that they were expected to perform. So just like just underscoring that that point, it's very important. Um, I'll take one more and then we'll open it up to the crowd again. Um, Ame, back to you. So what mechanisms are you putting in place to ensure control, auditability, and prevent agent sprawl? Agent sprawl, my goodness, like this, this feels like it's real. I, I can only imagine that you are being inundated with every vendor under the sun going, Well, I've got an agent for you. No, no, no, I've got an agent for you. So what do you do? Absolutely. I think this is a really, really important question, especially for organizations who are. Um, adopting autonomous AI at this point, and it's not an easy answer to this, right? So you need like a multi-dimension framework to address this. Uh, it's a combination of people, process, and technology, I would say. Um, when it comes to control, first of all, to ensure that the agent is indeed responding or actioning within the boundaries and with human intent for those high priority or really critical use cases like for example processing a payment, right? So you always need a human in the loop initially, right, till you gain a lot of confidence, uh, with this. Particular framework, right? So that is really, really important. Beyond that, I think it's very important to have like a stop switch and a rollback mechanism for an agent if you see that it's either hallucinating or uh let's say it's drifting a bit, right? So that is number 2 which is very important and you also have to periodically uh. Just take a look into what, what is, uh, what is the data this agent is accessing, right, and just reassess and, uh, kind of build those, uh, guard rails around, uh, just look at the security posture of this uh the risk classification of this particular agent, right, and all the action that it is doing and keep on readjusting. So that's very important when it comes to control. Um, the second aspect is auditability. I think we talked a bit about auditability, uh, but really auditability is all about we should be able. Able to trace everything back, every action and decision taken by the agent back all the way to its origin either, you know, for compliance purpose that's one, and second is if there is an incident, the post incident, uh, kind of analysis, right? Um, so we talked a bit about command center, but then there is also testing center which is really, really important beyond testing center enhanced audit logs, um, those are really, really important, and we at CrowdStrike, we love to use this information. Um, process into a language that we really understand so that we build, we will be, we build, uh, those additional layer of traceability and detailed logging into the tool of our liking. So that's what we all of this out of the box as you had invested in agent obviously it starts there, uh, we have all the information and you know, front facing people are used to different layers, right? So we apply some layer homegrown layer. Um, I think the 3rd most important topic, agent sprawl, right? So again this is, uh, a rapidly evolving space, so, uh, new terms are getting coined, right? So agent sprawl is basically proliferation of agent, right? I know folks might know here, but just reiterating, proliferation of agents, but agents which are unmanaged, unsupervised, redundant, right? The risk is, um, you know, they might be security risk number 1. 2nd is there might be a lot of cost overruns with this agent. In order to avoid agent sprawl, it's very important that you build an agent registry. So agent registry is very simple, right? The concept is very simple, right? Like, what is the agent, right? Uh, what is the scope of the agent? What is the API scope of the agent? What is the data scope of the agent? Uh, what exactly is the risk classification of this particular agent, right? You need to have all this information. Beyond that, once you build the agent, you also need to outline its complete life cycle right from the inception of agent all the way up to, uh, the decommissioning or archival of the agent. That's really, really important. Uh, if you, uh, I mean, these are a couple of areas which will help with the agent's sprawl. Beyond that, I think the agent should also have some owners, right? And ownership is, it's, it's going to be a shared responsibility, right at this point we are at a stage where business is super excited with the Asian tech, uh, uh, world, so they want access to the agent. They want to build because they look at it, it's a prompt we can go and we can build. Something they wanna do it right? yeah yeah all over again, yeah, exactly. So I think it's very important to draw certain boundaries initially while you are on this journey wherein you know an agent gets a business owner, right, who is responsible for mainly its value and then uh agent also gets an IT owner who is responsible for its maintenance, right? I think it was a lot of talking, but, uh, you know, if you combine this particular framework, I think. This may avoid the chaos and uh help you run the agenttic enterprise successfully yeah and I'm I'll put in a shameless plug on behalf of Salesforce is that this is exact agent sprawl what you just described what what a lot of organizations are facing is exactly why we released um MuleSoft agent fabric. It's a it, it's a. Capability that enables all oh and we've got a question here we'll come to you after um it's a capability that enables you to be able to look at agents that are not just sales force agents, not just agent force, but agents across the ecosystem and be able to put, put a layer of governance and control over those agents and trans uh the transparency. a little bit about your Same models to manage. Of course and also uh No any emergent behaviors from your politics God, OK, so I think you should, uh, go for it. Uh, so, and let me repeat, try to repeat your question. So you're saying that for this agent orchestration, are you using a separate LLM for it, or yeah, OK. So I mean kind of you could say that way because there is always, uh, there could be a headless agent orchestration there could be a one agent which actually does all the distribution to the various other agents like uh, a main agent orchestrators sitting over top of it. So yes, wherever there is an agent module, it has to be backed up by an LLM. But it also has to have a good agent SDK like what Salesforce has its own agent graph to come up, come with a very deterministic rule that what exactly and how exactly you're going to execute this particular task. We'll be calling multiple agents, so that particular combination of, uh, right SDK and the right LLM at every other, um, agent hierarchy, multi-agent hierarchy is important. So I would say, yeah, I mean to, to, to answer your question, yes, there is a separate LLM for each of that, and those LLMs you could select in the model optionality part. always I think the the emergent behavior is it has to be really uh bidirectional context sharing and a lot of things which you need to really have an A to a type of communication um but I would say uh the these are some of the things which we are seeing that that that's trending is more of like. Agent to agent collaboration is more towards how those shared systems are or how the systems are shared together like all the way from as Shibani mentioned about observability governance and other things so that's coming up now a lot of things are trending on that area where governance observability identity. These three things, I mean, I think I would say are key important roles. So, I wouldn't say that it's a behavior, but it is an insight that has come. Um, I think when, uh, uh, like just to back it up, agentic or autonomous agents have only existed for 1 year. Like it hasn't even existed for a long time. Like it's, it's as old as I am at Salesforce. Um, one of the patterns that has emerged is, I think early days of agentic architecture, autonomous agents, there was this idea that they're non-deterministic. You know, you ask them a question using these LLMs, it'll give you a response. You ask that question again based on the context that it gains, it might answer it slightly differently. Well, one of the patterns that emerged was actually there are times where you don't want autonomous agents to answer a question inconsistently, and that's where adaptive reasoning really came into play. I think that I'd say maybe what 3 months ago, 3-4 months ago where there was a greater focus to say no, no, no, there, there are times when particularly in a highly regulated industry there's no discretion in how a question is answered it's black and white and so that is something that's been really emerged or a pattern that that I've seen that uh. Again, at Salesforce we've, we've doubled down on that to, to ensure that we've got adaptive reasoning, meaning where you want a consistent response you have the ability to hard code that in where you want there to be some autonomy, some thinking like mimicking the patterns of, of a human that you can also enable that. OK, I'm gonna go on to the next one that I've got Rushi, how does the combined power of Agent Force and AWS help teams enforce AI governance and guardrails, and you could see that governance and guardrails, like this is a pretty big theme that we've come out with because this has been top of mind for a number of the, the tech leaders that all of us have been speaking with. So I, I think, I think Amit you, you talked about a bit on that part. Let me expand and show my perspective here that AI governance, specifically in the agent for stack, is, uh, three integrated layers at the application layer. It's an agent force trust layer that brings comes into the picture which does like data masking of PII data or prompt injection detection, toxicity detection, and also does a complete audit logging at all agent force interaction, uh, adhering to all the organization policies at every touch point including the agent interoperability, right? And the second layer which is basically the model layer. So agent force using anthropic cloud sonnet on bedrock, which is giving the, which is basically the anthropic cloud model is built on, as you mentioned, the constitutional AI principle to be helpful, harmless, uh, and honest by default. So this actually helps reduce the noncompliant or toxic data, even triggering the sales force trust layer it gets activated before that, right? So it gets a double protection in your thing and the. The Third thing which I will talk about is, in addition to that, I would say Consonant is also very strong at instruction following, right, that will help to do a kind of a reliable, you know, adherence to the organization policies. Now the last layer, which is the influencing layer which is on the bedrock and some of the trust models runs on the Amazon Sage maker in the private network of it, uh, of, uh, Salesforce that gives you like a complete control about your data not leaving the, uh, trust. Party, more importantly, it also gives you good traceability, you know, good, uh, auditability, and then I think good visibility to this entire thing. So entire governance stuff, um, so I would say just to, uh, summarize this, it's a kind of a defense in depth approach where our customers are getting, I mean, it's a complete visibility and control on the AI behavior with compliance audit clogging and all those aspects available to them. Fabulous. OK, Vivien, back to you. Top 3 steps Deloitte is recommending to clients to quickly and effectively enhance AI data governance. Yeah, that's a great question, and I, I think, uh, it's also timely because I think we have spoken about the governance throughout this. Amit, uh, uh, covered it, uh, part of it you mentioned some of it as well. I think, uh, obviously for all the right reasons, every enterprise is trying to get on the agentic enterprise journey and as they do it obviously for all the right reasons because there is like a huge business impact and the benefits that could be gained from that. At the same time, there is also a need to recognize the risk associated with it, like if you don't do it right. And some of the key things that obviously one of the very first thing that we did at Deloitte, and this is almost like 1824 months back, we defined what we call as a trustworthy AI framework, and that's what we take to our clients. And obviously if you go to like uh Deloitte.com or like Google it, you'll find like more details around it. But the top 3 things that we recommend to the clients based on the experience is, number 1, is you need to define and stand up your AI governance framework. And uh there needs to be a recognition that AI governance is not no more like a security or IT teams uh program, whatever the word is that's not, it's not their own ownership anymore. You need to recognize AI governance as a business problem and it needs to be dealt as a business problem and you need to solve as a business problem, yeah. Yeah, and then you need to have that top down buy-in from your leadership, and that's one of the things that I like when we work with Amit and his team at CrowdStrike is there is this top, top level like right from CIO down there is a full buy-in on like uh we want to be on the agentic path, we want to be an agentic enterprise, and we are invested in making it happen the right way. The second thing that I would say is, uh, obviously making sure you're defining your overall data governance, and then make sure you create a visibility of your data's life cycle. What that means is from the standpoint of documenting all your data sources, where the data exists, what elements of that data you are using in, what context would they be used in your models, how they enter into the models, and what leads to what happens from. Like the time they enter into the model to getting into the out the outputs that it generates, right? And having that like inventory of like your data and creating that visibility creates that trust with your stakeholders. If you don't earn that trust upfront, then you're going to struggle with like getting that adoption from your business stakeholders and even your customers. And then I think the 3rd, uh, maybe I will say 4 things, but the 3rd thing is more around like making sure you're automating some of your, uh. Ongoing continuous monitoring of what Amit was mentioning, right? You cannot really rely on somebody doing it periodically or uh some, some human trying to do those audits for you. You have to like automate it, make it proactive, and make sure you get those proactive alerts and you, if something is going wrong, you can define your thresholds around like, what is your hallucination threshold, what is your error threshold, and if those thresholds get breached, the system is able to alert it and you are able to course correct quickly. And the last thing that I would say, and this is going back to the point that Amit was making around like agent sprawl and like documenting all the agentic use cases, one of the things that we tell to the clients, and we have had these conversations with Amit as well is, is documenting your agentic use cases, but also documenting all the models that you're using and make sure. You're not creating another terminology that is in the industry right now is shadow AI. So you don't want to have the shadow AI. Somebody wanted to do something fancy because they liked it, and then nobody knows about it. And if you don't know what you're trying to protect, you're not going to protect it. So that's, that's the key. So those are the four things that I would say. Uh, are the top things, but obviously we can talk more. Like this is one of the topics where we can keep talking about. Well, good, and for, for those that are in the crowd, if anyone does have a question, we'll make sure we corner these gentlemen, make sure we keep them behind so you can ask any of the questions that you've got. Um, OK, one more. Amit, I, you know, because we're, we're getting down to the clock. Tell us about your journey with Deloitte, your path to success with Agent Voice AWS Deloitte. Like, just this is an open, more broader question. Absolutely. Were you gonna do it on your own? Did you decide to do it with a partner? Like how did you get to that? It's, it's an exciting partnership equilibrium, right? So Deloitte has been a trusted partner for CrowdStrike. It's been years, um, and, uh, Deloitte brings those transformative. Uh, mindset right on the table helps us think outside of the box. Uh, when you guys are starting with your agenting journey, you really have a few options like A, you can train your internal team, that's number one. Second is you can hire new talent, right? Third is you work with a partner and, uh, the partner can really give you a jump start or rather a slingshot I would say because, uh, uh, I mean this is that era, right? So they can bring in the governance leadership, the execution acumen. And that's where Deloitte comes in, right? So, uh, we started our journey on AsiaTech pretty recently, uh, but looking at the output that we have delivered, uh, the past quarter and what comes ahead, Um, in the next fiscal year and coming quarters, I'm really, really excited about the roadmap, right? Our strategy is very simple. It is, yeah, we give those tactical accelerators to business folks, right? One that they ask for, right? And beyond that we don't lose sight to the wider Asiantic roadmap, right? So we want our business teams to really reimagine. In their existing workflows as well and uh really come up with a very different mindset and open mindset to identify stuff right so and I think the path to success is exactly the same right like it's not only delivering the strategic like high efficiency games uh in like a quick turnaround time that's number one but at the same time also ensuring that the wider processes are reimagined um via engentic lens. That's great. And, and again, while Agenic, uh, autonomous might have only existed for one year, partners like Deloitte really bring the, the learned experiences from even generative implementation, AI abroad implementation. They see it across all of their clients. They bring it to you. Absolutely great. Thank you. Um, any questions from the crowd before we. Yes. So uh. Saslow and Yes. So I can Oh look at this. We're, we're getting the curtains. We got 6 seconds left for that, for that, uh, that question. Um, so Data 360 now Data cloud is called Data 360. I'll do the very quick version of it. You have a lot of lakes and warehouses like at, at my organization I had Azure. I had, um, Data Blake, Snowflake, but all of those lakes and warehouses you couldn't actually extract data to operationally leverage that data. Data to activate it across your ecosystem. What Data 360 or data cloud ended up being it was a thin activation layer. It wasn't a lake. It wasn't a warehouse. It has zero copy, meaning the data stays within those lakes and warehouses through a zero copy partnership. You could extract that data. You could activate it. You could use it, whether it's for personalization, whether it's for an agent to perform actions, and it would remain in the respective lakes and warehouses. The other clouds, those are just products. I, I don't know why we're, we're, we're changing that as well. Uh, like marketing cloud is just a, a suite of modules that enable marketing, um, in a more efficient way. Sales cloud is your CRM. Service cloud is like workflows and, and case case management as examples. OK friends, they wanna thank you all for sticking. We got right to the end. Got a couple of uh questions from the audience. I wanna thank you all for today and I wanna thank the crowd as well. Really appreciate it again we'll be here for, we'll be outside lingering questions. Thank you. Thank you.
