  Carlos Caruz frames the session around why data underpins every business outcome and why “digital transformation” is a continuous discipline rather than a time-boxed IT project. He argues that IT is inseparable from the business and that a clear data strategy—covering governance, accessibility, and security—is essential for innovation, competitive differentiation, and feeding emerging AI systems. AWS positions itself not as a single silver bullet but as a collaborator that tailors a blend of SAP capabilities, AWS native services, and partner tools to each customer’s risk tolerance, skills, and goals, noting the broad install base already running SAP workloads on AWS.
  He outlines three typical approaches customers take: leaning into SAP Business Data Cloud (BDC), choosing AWS native analytics and open table formats, or mixing in third-party platforms. Running BDC on AWS brings baked-in benefits such as Graviton processors for price-performance, the global AWS network backbone, and Amazon S3 storage. For customers preferring AWS native stacks, open table standards like Hudi and Iceberg offer time travel, concurrency, and lakehouse performance with AWS adding enterprise-grade security and manageability. AWS also publishes reference architectures and supports deep integrations with ISV partners like Databricks (Unity Catalog, Delta Lake) and Snowflake, plus a partner ecosystem that can execute migrations and proofs of concept.
  Customer guest Gustav Hilding, chief technical architect at Swedish retailer Axfood, explains how the company harmonized disparate systems by moving core processes and master data into SAP S/4HANA with IS-Retail and SAP CAR for point-of-sale feeds and promotion planning, while relying on AWS for analytics and faster-cycle innovation. Axfood now runs more than 100 machine learning models in production—about 20 focused on store and warehouse fulfillment—delivering roughly 30% better accuracy than standard systems by combining SAP data with additional signals. Models also power assortment optimization, promotion simulations, and e-commerce personalization (cross-sell, upsell, and next-best action recommendations across 50-item baskets).
  Hilding stresses replication over federation: Axfood copies SAP and non-SAP data into open formats on AWS to maintain a single master data foundation, avoid lock-in, and fuel both current and future agentic AI use cases. He views S/4 migrations as high-risk core work best kept one-to-one, with innovation layered on after establishing a clean, right-sized ERP baseline. Looking forward, his team is investing in data products, semantic layers, governance, and exposing data through MCP-style services so agents can act on business events autonomously.
  His advice: prove value early with high-impact AI cases to secure executive sponsorship and funding; build cross-functional teams that unite data scientists with traditional IT; reconcile timelines and agendas across suppliers; and choose robust technology (AWS in Axfood’s case) to sustain momentum. Carlos closes by inviting customers to engage AWS experts to co-design data strategies that blend SAP, AWS, and partner solutions based on each organization’s skills, cost profile, and desired outcomes.

Hello, good morning. How's it going? Welcome to Reinvent. Welcome to Vegas. Uh, thank you so much. Is this the first session that you're attending? No, not you. 3rd. Hats off for those of you that have decided to come to this session, uh, today to start and kick off, uh, real men, uh, folks, really, really appreciate it. Uh, let me introduce myself. My name is, uh, Carlos Carruz. I'm head of technology for Amazon Web Services. I've been in the company for like 12, kind of 12 years now, and I'm focusing on business application with a strong focus obviously on SAP, as you can think of, right? Uh, today with me, um, I also have, uh, Gustav Hilding. He's sitting there. He's coming from one of the nicest customers we have, uh, in Europe, uh, Axford. Everything that I say is like, OK, that's the theory, that's what AWS says. Everything that he says is the reality, right? The voice of the customer. So, uh, if you for whatever reason want to spend more time listening to him than to me, makes total sense. That's the way you will get really ideas and value out of this, uh, session. So the agenda is quite simple, right? First, we are gonna talk about, at least from our perspective, what data matters. What's the big deal with data and what's the big deal with data on, on AWS, right? Uh, we're gonna have a look at the products that are working on AWS from SAP, from third parties, from ourselves that you can leverage. To get the most value out of your data, right? We'll have a look at SCP products, AWS products, third party products, so kind of the, the whole thing, the whole picture. Then we'll try to see best patterns and, um, you know, reference architectures, uh, things that help you get the idea what's the art of the possible. And then we will spend a bit of time sitting here, Gustav and myself, and this is where Gustav is gonna tell us, uh, his journey, how he's, you know, dealing with the data strategy in his company, what are the things that are making him more competitive, more innovative in the market, so that's kind of the big deal of the, of the conversation. So the first thing is like, OK, data, what data matters, um. OK, spoiler. Data matters a lot. Data is the foundation for every single thing that you can do to be more innovative in the market. There is tightly, tightly close and related to what are the business outcomes that we are all looking for. Um, usually when we talk to, to customers, there's this sweetest spot when we identify customers that want to be innovative, that want to break the status quo, that want to think like, um, out of the box, right? It's like, no, I don't want to do what everybody else is doing. I want to do something different and then. If we are lucky we're able to talk to them and then together we try to work on how to make them more successful, more competitive, more innovative, how to, you know, again, break the rules and be ahead of their competitors in the, in the market. And usually all these things tend to start with this kind of topic that you've been hearing for the last 1015 years, digital transformation, digital transformation, right? We want to transform our company to be digital. Um, we ran an, uh, survey a few, uh, few time ago, and 90% of the respondents that were customers were telling us, I'm struggling to understand and to respond to my customer needs. 9 out of 10. I'm struggling to really get the reality to push check of my customers to give them what they are looking for. And the funny thing in that same survey. 45% said, I've completed my digital transformation, and I'm like, something is not working here, right? If 9 out of 10 are telling me I'm struggling to understand my customers, I'm struggling to get the proper data to really see what's going on with my customers and what they are looking for, but 4 or even 5 out of 10 are telling me my digital transformation is over, is that there's something that is not working here, right? It's something that is like, uh, missing. And talking to some people, some of them say, no, it's digital transformation, it's digital, and suddenly it's like, oh, that's the IT department, that's something that the CIO will take care of. I don't care because I'm running the business, and that's kind of a problem because it kind of isolates the companies, right? Some other customers are telling us, no, it's a transformation. This is a 12 month project, and I will do my digital transformation in 12 months. Like if you could set boundaries to this. Technology moves so fast. Technology advances so, so fast that this is the transformation in our belief. It's something that is never ever going to stop. It's an ongoing effort that we need to push to make sure that we are really ahead of the curve if we can and take advantage of all these beautiful technology, new solutions that are coming our way, right? And then you have this other topic, IT and the business. This is IT, this is the business. And that's wrong by default. Have you ever heard a CFO saying that's finance and that's the business? They don't think about that or from someone from marketing. No, I'm doing marketing. I'm not doing business, but for whatever reason, in many companies like, you know, this is IT, uh, it's like a cost center, and then there's the business where it's totally wrong because at the end of the day if you're working in IT, IT is the fuel of the business. IT is the part of the organization that really makes things happen. And also, IT, if managed properly, is able to change the business. It's the part of the company that is able to look behind corners. It's the part of the business that is able to identify patterns to detect trends, to be ahead of the curve, to forecast what is gonna happen and be ready to really generate new revenue streams, new business, new value. That's the kind of things that IT is able to do for the business. Why? Because, very simple, IT. Is the business and not only that, it's not only that IT is the business, it's that data is the fuel of IT. Data is IT. IT is the business. The data that you are getting, that you're gathering is what is driving the business. Imagine your companies that suddenly you don't have access to the data. You don't have access to information. Could your business work? Maybe yes, I don't know. I would struggle to see many companies, even ourselves, being able to run our business if we don't have the data. That's why it's so important to really have a clear view on what we're gonna do with the data that we are generating. What is our data. strategy because having a proper data strategy is what is going to be able to give us the proper foundation to really start securing things that will make me more competitive in the market, therefore to have a better and stronger business. And when we're talking to, to, to customers and, and they talk about, OK, these are the challenges that I see with SAP, right? Or or what I'm looking for when I'm looking at data on, on SAP. Some of the things that you are telling us is like. I need to feel half a clear. I need to have this need for having a speed in the way I'm able to consume data. It's not that I need to wait for a whole week for this report to come to me and see what happened during the previous week. I need to have real-time information. I need to have better visibility on my projects, on my processes. I really need to understand what's going on right now so I can take, or I can take better informed decisions. I need to have control of my data, everything that is happening, so then I can use this data to feed. New technologies, uh, probably you are coming here to reinvent, you're gonna hear 2 million times the term generative AI, agentic AI, agentic systems. All these things, if you want them to be valuable for you, you need to feed them with your data. And also you need to make sure that this data is controlled, is secure, is accessible, is ready to be used by the people that want to use it in the way they need to use it, but only for those people that can use it and access it. And then people tell me, OK, but why AWS? So all of these things that you see out there, forget about them. I mean, they are there. They are totally right. I mean, it's like we have strong integrations with SAP. We work with third parties, state of the art technology. The thing that's really I would tell you, and that's something that I want you to remember is The value that AWS can provide to you is that together you and our teams can start defining what is the real or the most valuable solution for you. We have an incredible team of solutions architects, experts that really know every single thing about how the data works within the SEP world, with BDCs. AW's native solutions, third parties from data bricks, snowflakes, having this conversation with you is what is going to make the difference because I guarantee you something. If you came here just looking for this silver bullet about what should I be doing with my data management on SAP, sorry folks, there's no silver bullet. What we can do with you. Is to craft, is to build your silver bullet for yourself to meet your needs and be more again, efficient, competitive in the market. So many customers already using AWS to run their SAP workloads. Thousands of customers from many different industries, from many different places with many different use cases, all of them totally different one from the other, and all of them using their own solution for their own needs, um. When talking about data, there are like 3 main patents. Imagine that's like the kind of way of looking at things, right? Some comes from much are telling us, you know what, I'm really enjoying all the SAP solutions, and I really want to go with BDC. That's great. That's beautiful. Use it nice, and you have all the solutions there. Some others are telling us, you know what I mean, SAP, we have the information there, but I want to use the AWS native solutions. You have a plethora of beautiful solutions, uh, enterprise great open source solutions that I can start using with the security and the safety that I know that the AWS is providing this layer of enterprise superiority on top of them. That's great. That's fine. Use them. Some others basically I'm telling us, you know what? I want to go with third party tools, right? I really love data breaks. I really love Snowflake. I want to integrate with them. That's good too. Again, what I can tell you is let's talk about it and let's find what's the best solution for you in terms of risk, cost, knowledge, skill set, outcomes that you want to achieve. That's the value that we can provide you. Because at the end of the day, what we really see is not that there's the solution A or the B of the C. It's a blend of all of them, right? For this particular use case, I'm gonna go with this third party solution. For this other use case, I'm gonna use this AWS service. For this other use case, I'm gonna stay with what SAP is already bringing me because it's working pretty well, and that's nice and that's good, right? Reality, you need to adapt the technology to your needs. That's the trick here. An example that we are seeing so late, so, so many times, you know, that, uh, SAP Business warehouse, SAPBW is an online 2027, right? So what should I do with that, right? I need to move to something else. Should I go from, I don't know, I have a very old ACC system and I want to move to HANA, and then I want to move to, to BDC. Do I want to do the migration from scratch and created everything from new? Again, no silver bullet. Let's try to identify what's going on. Let's identify what are your challenges, and let's work together on that. An option could be staying with BTC. An option could be staying with AWS Native Solution. Another option again could be using third party solutions that you all already know. Let's see what's the best ocean that fits your needs depending on so many different angles out there, right? If we go and look at the SAP products that we have right now for, for data, um, BDC business data cloud. What happens if you are using BDC already? If you're using BDC on AWS, you know, it's been running on us for kind of a year now, more or less, right? You are taking some functionalities that are super interesting out of the box. The first one, Graviton processors. Anyone familiar with the graviton processors rings any bell? OK, uh, this is a cellphone, right? Uh, this uses an ARM processor. What we have done is we've created our own ARM processors. We call them Graviton and they are the most price performance processors that you can ever find. They are super fast, incredibly reliable, huge bandwidth, and super cost effective, and the power consumption is, is lower. Basically, the ERM processors have really taken the market very strongly and using this grarithm. This gives you a performance that is incredible. It's strong, super, super strong. But also if you're using BDC, you're already leveraging the AWS backbone, our whole network that is connecting, you know, systems, uh, regions all over the world. So you have this interconnectivity already there. So you have the security, you have this strong foundation for your systems. And of course you are using Amazon S3. One of the most famous storage systems, uh, that you already know, S3 is kind of one of our foundation systems, one of our, we call the building blocks, right? And Matton S3 is one of the building blocks that we already have, and all the BDC is running on top of, uh, S3. Long story short, if you're already using BDC, you can take advantage of AWS advanced features that we already provide to SAP so you can enjoy them directly. What about the AWS natively? Um, I can't go very technical here about open tables, hoodie, iceberg, all this technical stuff. Incredible things. Open tables, you know, it's the next big deal in the usage of, you know, uh, data lakes, uh, but the trick here probably for me is these are open source standards. And these are the ones that are really providing the state of the art in technology, right? You have like indexes, travel back in time, uh, direct record access, concurrency at maximum levels. So all these things that is stored in a data warehouse were challenges for you with these new standards, they are already being solved. What is the beauty of. That that if you're using AWS solutions, what we are doing is we're getting these tools and we are in this extra layer of enterprise great solutions. So you have the security, the performance, the stability, all these things that you're expecting from this products that are great, but when they are given to you by AWS. So the trick here is basically is like how do I democratize these solutions so they are very easy to use for you leveraging the AWS systems that we already provide to you. Uh, of course, uh, we have standards, reference architectures, like if you want to start using those things, there are like best practice out there that are really working pretty well. Directly connecting to with Amazon Blue, with Pel Solutions, with, uh, many other things. But basically the idea here is that both. The SAP world of data and AWS can integrate very, very easily. And also we have reference architectures done by SAP with us. That's another example. If you go to to this QR code, you will go to the SAP Discovery Center and basically you will see all those, you know, reference architectures that we have built together with SAP so you can take the solution that really fits your needs. What else? The other one, ISB solutions, uh, you know them. We've been working with these folks, uh, since forever, right? Uh, there are like several places, but the two big ones you already know the names. First one, Data bricks, right? You can run data bricks nailed natively on AWS. What you can use BDC with the data bricks flavor, and the beauty here is that you have all these beautiful elements of the Unity catalog, uh, Delta Lake, and basically all these elements that help you to run. Your Spark work gloss in a very easy way. When do you use it? Are you familiar with data bricks? Do you already have that? Let's go and talk. Let's see how we can integrate it together. It's super simple. Same thing at the other side of the house with our our other friends at Snowflake, exactly the same, right? Snowflake has a beautiful, beautiful product, very easy again to integrate with AWS, to integrate with our plethora of solutions on generative AI with our LLMs with our. Identical elements. So basically the idea here again is so simple is let's identify what are your challenges, what is your skill set, what are the tools that you already have, what are the tools that you think that you will really need? Let's talk about them and let's create the proper strategy for your needs, right? And of course we have many partners. I'm not going to go very deep here, but for instance, one example is Selvatech. Sell Vech is a partner that is super focused on SAP and AWS, and they can do the proper assessments on, OK, you want to go to BDC. That's the way to do it. Let's run if you want also POCs. Let's move things to production. So long, long story short, the idea here is that it's not that you should have the skills is that we can help you to find obviously the right partner. To execute all these uh migrations, all these projects that you have in a super convenient and secure way for you so we can maximize the success that is gonna happen in these projects. Last thing for you, summary and call to action, so simple. If you are running into a data project with SAP or non-SAP data, let's talk, right? We have the experts who know every single thing about how to, you know, work with SAP data. You wanna go to BDC? That's great. We can help you. You wanna go with AWS Native Solutions. Beautiful. You want to do a blend of all of them. That's nice. That's great. Do you want to integrate with an ISB like the ones we already discussed? Why not? Come on, let's go and do it. The beautiful thing here is that we have the expertise in-house to help you succeed in these projects. And with this, I told you it was gonna be super, super high level, very, very fast because I think the very big deal right now, that the interesting part of the session is listening, uh, to Gustav, to Gustav Hildin. He's the chief, uh, architect officer of Ax Foods, but, well, uh, we will introduce him in a second. So Gustav, welcome to the stage. Thank you. So very excited to be here in Vegas. Thank you, Gustave, for, for being here. It's not your first reinvent at all. No, no, no, no. I've been to a couple of reinvents before. I think it's my 10th time in Vegas. So I, I thought I was here many times until he told me he's the 10th reinventing in Vegas. Yes, awesome. And hey, why don't you introduce yourself? I mean, you're working from, you're coming from Sweden, uh, you're working in Axwood, one of our nicest customers, retailer, but tell us a bit about, you know, Axfoood and, and, and yourself. Yeah, thank you. Well, Ax Food is a Swedish retailer. We have around 800 stores and we serve millions of customers every week. I think we have around 25% of the market share of all food that's being sold in Sweden, which is quite a lot. So we're really into volumes and uh. Yeah, it's a nice company to be at. Uh, I've been there for 15 years now. I started back in 2010. Uh, I've had different responsibilities with our teams of web development, portals, and also within architecture. So last 8 years I've been a chief technical architect at Ax Food working with both SAP and AWS. Before Ax Food, I was a consultant. I was an SAP consultant, so I know my old Abob code. And yeah, uh, it's about 20 plus years of experience there. wow, nice. And um I know you have a pretty decent SAP footprint, right? Like um massive amount of CPUs, huge amount of memory you're using. And the ERP, so, so many different, uh, components here and there. Tell us a bit about, uh, how you're using SAP, on your daily basis at. Well, our journey with SAP started, uh, over 15 years ago. I mean, back in the days we had a plethora of different systems. Uh, we really needed harmonization, so we got a lot of business value just by introducing SAP, getting integrated data, integrated processes, and simple ways of working instead of having multiple systems. So for us, we keep most of our data in S4. That's where we have our master data. Since we're in retail, we're running the industry solution for IS retail as well, so we keep our articles there, the assortments, uh, our campaigns, and a lot of our core processes really run on SAPS4. Uh, and we really need to be able to customize S4 as well because doing retail you need to customize. So on top of S4 we've got SAPCAR, which is the customer activity repository. I think it's got everything except the customer object right. Uh, anyway, the car is where you have the point of sales data, so all the receipts from our stores, they flow into the car. C is also the place where we do more unique customizations because we plan our assortment and our promotions in the car as well. And on top of that, we use AWS. On AWS we've got our data stack, so we build all our AI and machine learning on top of AWS and we also build our analytical applications right now on AWS. So more innovative solutions and more uh shorter time frame for our solutions on AWS than in SAP. Nice. Also more innovation. Cool, that, that's nice. So basically, Uh, you have a blend of SAP solutions and also AWS to run your data analytics, AI. Uh, I know that you are running a lot of, uh, models for forecasts, assortment management, so super cool stuff that has been built on top of the data systems that you have built, right? Tell me a bit more about it. How do, how does it work in retail, many flows are about moving goods from point A to point B, and really volumes are key for us, and we're also working with fresh items. We need to have the stuff at the right place at the right time. Uh, so we do a lot of optimizations on our forecasts and um do a lot of predictions on where stuff needs to be. So we are running, uh, for instance, a lot of machine learning models right now. I think we have over 100 machine learning models in production, yes, over 100. Around 20 of these models are just for fulfillment of stores and warehouses and uh. By doing custom AI models, we get an accuracy that is around 30% better than in standard systems, so they are your models, our custom built models definitely because standard systems are great, especially when you have regular flows and everything is as it should be. But if you introduce campaigns, seasons, irregularities in your flows, the deviations, that's where you can beat them by using a lot of data that we don't have in SAP. Together with the SAP data and build better forecasts, so that's one area where we do a lot of work actually. Uh, another area is in our assortment planning where we, it's kind of like a tug of war between different parameters in assortment planning. I mean you, you tweak one parameter and then something else goes bad. If you lower the price for one article, well, something else sells less, for instance, so you get cannibalization. We try to do simulations with AI models and to get the best outcome for us and our customers and also to get the good volumes flowing through our company at the right time. So that's not a big area for us for uh AI and machine learning. And also when we're doing e-commerce, uh, in our e-commerce, well, uh, our shopping baskets are normally around 50 items, so. Customer experience is really, really important. If you have to click 50 times at the basket, you get tired quite fast, right? So we do a lot of article relation models. We use them to do cross-sell, upsell, and recommendations for our customers. We also look at your purchases. History for instance and serve you with your most favorite items, your most purchased items, and we try to predict what your next best action is going to be so we also can serve you with recommendations based on what we think and also give you inspiration on what other customers who are similar to you what they are buying. So that's another area and yeah, I think I forgot about half of our AI models right now but but that's massive to have so many, you know, models trained, but. In order to train them, uh, you need to have data, right? Your data, yeah, which is the one that provides value, right? And, uh, right now we're talking a lot about, you know, the, uh, GDP, uh, unified data. We need to have like a really frame, clear framework on how we are using data, where we are placing data so we can take the best out of that. Oh, for me it's, sorry folks, for me this is vital, right, for, for a company to really have a proper strategy on, on data. But what's your point here? Well, I think what's happening right now is that many application providers like SAP, Salesforce, and other companies, they're building solutions, applications that use big data. For SAP, for instance, they are extracting data from their core systems into BDC and then they're building new modules on top of BDC. So if you want to buy a new replenishment model in a couple of years when it's finished, it's going to require you to have BDC probably. Uh, at the same time, most customers have already started to build up their ecosystems in the cloud, so we've done that on AWS. Many other customers have done it on some other cloud maybe. So we have kind of chosen a different way already, uh, where we are with our data stacks. And now you get the question, well, how are you going to marry these two worlds together when SAP comes with BDC and you've got something else. I think you need to have a good data strategy that answers questions like, are you going to work in data silos, are you going to federate, or are you going to replicate all the data? Uh, well, at Axfood, we've been replicating data from all systems, both SAP and non-SAP. For a very long time for us, the answer is really simple. We need to replicate the data. You want to have a master. We need to have a master exactly. I mean, could have their use cases if that is interesting in the future, but. I think you still need to have one master for all your data and that needs to be in open formats and on open standards as well. I mean you will get some lock in whatever you choose, but I would, I would definitely go for the thing that's most open in this case. So, basically, in order to, to have this, you know, differentiation that you're talking about, right? Like I'm gonna be, or I'm gonna try to be, you know, more efficient than my competitors. I'm gonna provide a better user experience to my customers. You're using all these models that you have trained leveraging your data strategy, right, with all the elements, SAP or not SAP that are able to generate this, this data there, um, but there are some situations where, um, you know, this kind of Decisions on how I am going to run my data strategy are more like financial, maybe call it that way, like, um, a cap ex thing than really an innovation. What I'm hearing from you is basically innovation. What, what's your point there? Imagine, uh, when this, uh, you know, conversations have been taken by the CFO, maybe another someone that is able to see, you know, a bit broader and say, OK, what I want to run is this differentiation that is gonna make my company still be valuable and strong after some years, right? Yeah, I think what's going on right now is like, well, most customers are migrating from ECC to S4 or to some cloud for that matter, and everybody's like, can I introduce some innovation in that process? I would say that depends on how much you use SAP. For us it's really intertwined in our business. We've got it everywhere basically, so doing these projects is a big risk. It's really core processes. You don't touch them easily, so to say. So really also most other customers I know, they, they tend to go for like a 1 to 1 scope when they do the S4 migration. And then after that you can do innovation because having a clean, right sized ERP running in the cloud, that's basically the basis for innovation in the future. Of course, if you're only doing like uh uh re-hosting project, well, you might need some use cases where you can do infrastructural innovation. That might be a case, but still, it depends on, on the risk you have in the project, I would say. So. Innovation is hard to combine this really, I think get a good baseline and then innovate. Now that, that makes sense. And, uh, again I, I think it goes with the idea of, um, you know, there's no single way to do things, right? You know, to really understand what's my projects, what are my objectives, what are the best projects that I can do here? What are the people that can help me minimize risks, optimized, uh, outcomes. So that's kind of the, the idea here. What about looking forward, uh, what are the projects that are keeping you awake now or super excited? What are these things that are telling you like, mm, these are gonna be the next big things that we are gonna do to continue disrupting the market? Well, data strategy is one important topic. I mean, it's never finished, I would say it's. Continuous work that you have and we are building data products we've been using data for professionally for over 1015 years right now. We build multiple layers of data. We've got a semantic layer as well and when you introduce data products to that, you need to think through how do you structure your layers in the data stack. So really we, we're working a lot with data products right now and also with the governance on them. That's one area where I see a lot of innovation. Other than that, um, the world of agentic AI requires you to have good clean data and also support technical support for the use cases, so we're looking at MCP servers, looking at how to expose the data in a nice way, uh, to be able to have the next generation of agents running. I, I'm dreaming of this system where you have the data and you can have sensory stuff in your data layers like this happened in my business, so I'm going to do that actually. No, so we were discussing, uh, remember about this idea of, you know, the work of the integration between system eventually is gonna kind of disappear because, you know, the, the agents that are gonna be able to talk, uh, to, to each other and, um. No, facilitate this, so the, the focus would be on really optimizing, as we were saying, right, the interconnectivity within different, um, elements here, here and there. Um, I don't know any final advice for the, for the audience, Gustav? Anything that you can tell them, OK, if out of the lessons that learned throughout all these years, these are the 23, you know, golden nuggets that I want. To share with you, definitely, well, we introduced some high value use cases early on for us and that got the attention of our management and they started to measure the impact of AI on our business and really that was key for us to get funds released to get an organizational maturity, and in that way we could create teams. We have the right staffing, we could focus on collaboration as well between data scientists and more traditional IT staff. So that was one thing that was really good for us. Uh, otherwise I would say like it's a hard world for your suppliers right now. They have different agendas. You might have your agenda, the timelines might not align. I would say try to find some common ground where you can build from, um, and then besides that, use good technology. For us it's AWS. For somebody else it might be something different. Thank you. Yeah, so basically try to prove the value of the things that you're doing as soon as possible. And leverage the state of the art technology to be able to be more effective and and competitive. Get management on board. Oh yeah, yes, exactly, uh, so folks, uh, if you really wanna go a bit deeper on, uh, Gustav's story and with Ax F this afternoon, uh, your session MAM. 2:14 if I'm not wrong, you're gonna be on a stage, yes, you're gonna have the slides. You're gonna show some, uh, a nice deck explaining all these things and many other projects, uh, that you're running. So I would really, really encourage you if you wanna go deeper into all the things that he's been able to do at his company to, to attend that session because it's the one that is gonna really show you what's, you know, internally happening within Axford, right? So that was it, uh, folks, hope you enjoyed the session. Uh, Gustav, thanks a lot for being here with us today. It's been a pleasure and of course if you have doubts or questions we will be more, more than happy to go and talk to you once the, the session is over. Thank you so much. Hope you enjoyed that and have a lot of fun, learn a lot from Reinvent. Thank you so much for being here. Thank you. Thank you.
