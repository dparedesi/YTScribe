summary: "This session, titled \"Seamless Network-based Fraud Protection for FinTech & Digital Business\" (SEC216), features Oscar Rodriguez, Senior Director of Global Partner Solutions at Vonage, who provides a deep dive into how leveraging mobile network intelligence can combat the growing threat of industrial-scale fraud facing modern digital platforms. Rodriguez begins by establishing Vonage's robust infrastructure as part of Ericsson, serving over 100,000 enterprise customers, and argues that the nature of fraud has fundamentally shifted from manual, isolated incidents to a highly productized \"fraud-as-a-service\" economy. In this new landscape, sophisticated attack chains—including voice cloning, drag-and-drop phishing kits, and automated SIM swapping services—are available for purchase, allowing even non-technical bad actors to launch massive, automated attacks for mere pennies. This democratization of cybercrime has drastically lowered the barrier to entry while exponentially increasing the volume and velocity of attacks, creating a scenario where traditional, reactive defense measures are no longer sufficient. Rodriguez pinpoints social engineering as the persistent \"weak link,\" accounting for 70% of breaches, and identifies the mobile phone number as the critical vulnerability often exploited through techniques like SIM swapping and SMS pumping. To effectively counter these threats without degrading the user experience, he introduces the concept of \"network-based intelligence,\" which exposes real-time data from the mobile network directly to businesses. This approach allows for an invisible, \"always-on\" protection layer that silently validates crucial risk signals—such as whether a device is legitimate, if the subscriber matches the account holder, or if a SIM card has recently been swapped—all happening in the background without user intervention. This significantly contrasts with traditional friction-heavy methods like SMS One-Time Passwords (OTPs), which are increasingly susceptible to interception and phishing. Rodriguez details Vonage's \"Protection Suite,\" specifically highlighting the Verify API for silent authentication and the Identity Insights API, which provides granular data points like \"current carrier,\" \"roaming status,\" and \"location verification.\" He performs a technical demonstration showing how a simple API call can return a \"subscriber match\" score by comparing user-provided data against authoritative carrier records in milliseconds, potentially preventing million-dollar breaches. The presentation concludes with a compelling case study of Lydia, a European neobank with 8 million users, that implemented Vonage's silent authentication. The move resulted in a 50% reduction in authentication times and the complete elimination of SMS-based social engineering attacks—since there were no codes for users to inadvertently share—proving that network-level verification can simultaneously enhance security, lower costs, and improve the customer journey."

Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining me as I talk to you about seamless network-based fraud protection in FinTech and digital business. I'm Oscar Rodriguez, senior director of global partner solutions at Vonage, and today we're gonna look at how the mobile network can help stop fraud before it ever reaches your, uh, business. Now FinTech and digital platforms are under constant pressure to balance security with user experience, and attackers are getting faster, cheaper, and more automated. Now I'll walk you through how network-based intelligence, uh, silent authentication, and branded communication can create a seamless layer of protection that improves trust, strengthens conversions, and lowers cost. So let's jump in. First of all, let me take a moment to ground us into who Vonage is today as part of Ericsson. So we are an end to end communications provider that serves more than 100,000 enterprise customers across more than 100 countries. Our platform supports 1.7 over 1.7 million registered developers and is powered by a global team of over 2500 employees, including over 900 in product and technology. On the left, uh, on the left side you can see the full suite that makes this possible. Uh, we combined unified communications, contact center capabilities, and our full range of communication APIs covering voice, video, messaging, and social channels. Then on the, the right, uh, half of the wheel you'll see the next generation of network. Work powered solutions. This includes mobile identity tools like verify with silent authentication and identity insights, fraud defender fraud defender services, and new capabilities for location, network insights, and connectivity experience. Together this creates a complete ecosystem that lets businesses engage, authenticate, and protect their customers using both traditional channels and intelligence from the mobile network. It is a foundation that enables everything we are talking about today, especially the next wave of fraud prevention powered by network APIs. So one of the problems that we're seeing now is that fraud is no longer a manual one-off effort. It has become productized. Entire attack chains are packaged as easy to use services that anyone can buy. Criminals no longer need technical skills. They can subscribe to a $5 voice uh cloning sass, spin up a drag and drop fishing kit with built-in support, by the way, or even purchase SIM swap as a service. Now these tools make it simple to launch attacks at a massive scale. And the cost to run these attacks has collapsed as well. What used to take time, skill, and resources can now be executed for just since. AI and automation are doing the heavy lifting, which means more attacks launched faster and by more people. Now the barrier entry has never been lower. What once required a sophisticated hacker can now be done by a script kitty with a credit card. This is why defenses need to evolve. Fraud has become industrial, and our protection strategy has to match that level of scale and automation. Now you should know that fraud is exploding across every channel. The average data breach now costs $4.4 million and nearly one in four US adults have experienced some type of account takeover or fraud just last year. Anybody in the audience experience any type of account fraud or takeover? No, no, maybe know somebody that has. There you go, so you're not alone. Even the most secure of organizations get hit. In fact, in January 2024, the SEC's official Twitter account was hacked. A single fake post about Bitcoin ETF approval sent markets surging before the breach was confirmed. So what does that tell us? If the SEC can be compromised, anyone can. Now, the SEC hack wasn't a technical exploit. Uh, it was done through social engineering, and this is the same pattern we see across industries. That's where fraudsters pretend to be customers or employees. They use SIM swaps to take over numbers, fish for credentials, and spam users with multi-factor prompts until somebody finally gives in. All of these start with one weak link. Anybody guess what that weak link is? What's that? You're getting close. What's that? It's the phone number. Everybody has a mobile device that has a phone number attached to it, even a wearable that has a phone number attached to it, and we rely on it for many things. So Let's imagine in a contact center scenario, an agent gets a call, the phone number presented in the caller ID matches that of a customer record. The name provided by the caller also matches that customer record. But in reality, the caller is a hacker or fraudster that took over that SIM an hour ago. Now, without trust signals. Which Vonage can provide, the agent might help reset the account, or approve a large transfer in a banking scenario, which could drain somebody's life savings. Ruining lives, and of course, brand reputation. Now every incident like this erodes trust. And brand loyalty. And since 70% of breaches start with social engineering, prevention must happen in real time. Now on this slide we're introducing the idea that uh next generation fraud protection is now possible because it taps directly into the mobile network. This gives businesses a way to stop fraud before it ever reaches their systems, and it does this without slowing down or inconveniencing legitimate users. The mobile network quietly verifies who is on the other end of a phone number. It confirms that the device is real, that the subscriber is authentic, and that nothing suspicious is happening behind the scenes. So during an account creation, login, or high value actions like Large transfers, real customers move through with no extra steps because the checks are happening invisibly. In the background Now this same intelligence can block a wide range of threats in real time. Fake accounts, account takeovers, refund abuse, social engineering attempts, phishing and smishing, even traffic pumping all become detectable because the network can see signals that apps and browsers alone simply cannot. If something looks off, it is flagged, and before it even becomes a fraud, everything, and, and, and if everything checks out, well, the user continues without any friction. Now this creates a protection layer that sits under your business and your customers. It is always on and it is always verifying. Customers never notice it, but it is constantly shielding them from account and communications fraud. It reinforces the entire fraud prevention stack while keeping every trusted interaction smooth and seamless. Now when you look at the full customer journey, fraud is not isolated to just one stage. It can show up anywhere from the moment the user first signs up to the interactions they have months or even years later. What is powerful about the mobile network intelligence is that it gives you protection at every point without changing the customer experience. At the very beginning during account creation, the mobile network can confirm that the person actually possesses the phone number that they are using. This happens instantly and invisibly using silent authentication. And it helps prevent fake or automated account creation without forcing the user through extra verification steps. Now, when the user logs in, uh, or performs any sensitive action. The network can silently verify that the device and subscriber match what you would expect if someone has hijacked an account or is trying to break in, well then the access can be blocked right away. Now during account recovery, which is one of the biggest points of vul vulnerability. The network can detect SIM swap activity, and since SIM swaps are often used as a precursor to fraud, catching that signal early protects both the user and the business during the reset process. Now even in day to day interactions like customer service calls or outbound outreach, the network adds trust. Branded calls and messages ensure that the customer knows the communication is legitimate, which helps eliminate spoofing and impersonation attempts. So across onboarding, authentication, recovery, and engagement, the mobile network acts as a continuous and invisible shield. It strengthen security at every step while keeping the experience simple and smooth for real customers. The Vonage Protection Suite is our umbrella set of capabilities for mobile identity and fraud prevention, all powered by the intelligence of the mobile network. Now, the first piece is our Verify API with silent authentication. This is our network-powered two-factor authentication solution. It confirms possession of the phone number directly with the mobile network, which makes it harder, harder to spoof and far more reliable than traditional SMS-based OTPs. Next is our identity insights API with SIM swap. This brings network level intelligence into your fraud and risk models. It gives you real-time signals about the status of the device and subscriber, helping you strengthen decisions around onboarding, login, and high value actions. Remember our earlier example where the uh agent could have approved a large transfer? If he had known that the same was swapped, he would have blocked that. Now then we have branded uh communication. This allows businesses to, um, send trusted branded messages and calls that are hard to spoof. It helps customers know that the message is message or call, uh, they are receiving is truly coming from you, the brand. Uh, which reduces scams and social engineering attempts. Now together, these solutions form a comprehensive protection layer that helps secure accounts, reduce fraud, and build trust across every customer interaction. So I'm gonna go ahead and switch over to a, a quick demo. So let me walk you through this, uh, short demo. So notice the for this particular, uh, request, we're using our identity insights API. now the payload in this case includes, uh, insights, uh, for format, SIM swap, subscriber match, uh, I'm sorry, uh, SIM swap and current and original carrier, all of which are now generally available for all US major carriers through Vonage. Location verification, subscriber match, roaming, and reachability insights are planned in future releases. So as you can see, current carrier gives us the type of line. In this case it's a a mobile line we're using this UK number being a mobile line, so it means that we can get additional insights on that phone number from the network. Next is format. Uh, the format insight, uh, tells us the country the number belongs to, including, uh, the country code and regional time zones, and of course, uh, country specific formatting as well. As an example, in North America we use the parentheses around the, the area code. Uh, next we have original carrier. Uh, original carrier, um, if, uh, it differs from the current carrier, from that you can derive that the number was ported, uh, and if it was ported and you combine that with a SIM swap signal, well, that can be some type of clue that there might be some type of account takeover. SIM swap not only tells us if the SIM was swapped, but it will also give us a time stamp of when it was swapped last and you can actually include a parameter in the request, uh, indicating a period that you want to check. So if you wanted to check uh the last hour, um, up to the last 100 days to see if a SIM was was swapped within that period of time. Uh, for subscriber match. Um, you basically provide us, uh, any information that you have on this, uh, particular user, uh, and phone number. So if you have, uh, their name, for example, a date of birth, and even an address, we'll go ahead and check that with the mobile network, uh, records, and we'll provide you with, uh, a match on that. In this case you could see that the first name, last name match, um, and then, uh, looks like we've moved on past that. Sorry about. Uh, so, uh, you might have noticed that the first name and last name match exactly the date of birth. There was a partial match. Uh, for location verification, this allows us to check if the device associated with the phone number is within a certain radius of a location, such as where a transaction or a login attempt, um, is, is expected to take place. And then roaming will return true or false, uh, just depending on if the the user is roaming and also return uh where the user is roaming, which country, and then reachability will determine if the device is connected to the network through uh SMS or a data channel. All right, so that was a very simple demo of our identity insights API. Very simple. It's a quick API that takes milliseconds to execute, but really it could save what I say $4.4 million the average data breach cost. For an API call that costs just cents. All right, so let me finish with a real world example of silent authentication at scale. So Lydia is one of Europe's fastest growing neobanks, serving more than 8 million users. Uh, they were looking for a way to strengthen security without slowing anyone down, so they moved to Vonage Verify and silent authentication. Now the impact was immediate. Authentication times dropped by 50%, giving users a faster and smoother login experience. Now, when silent authentication is used, they also eliminated eliminated SMS-based social engineering attacks entirely because silent Author removes the need for one-time codes that can be intercepted or uh fished. And on top of that, they were able to lower their total cost of ownership compared to their previous solution, since Silentoff reduces reliance on SMS while improving conversion rates. This is a great example of how network-powered authentication can protect users, improve performance, and optimize cost all at the same time. That has been my presentation. Thank you for your time.
