Can I get the water? I don't know. Sorry. I don't know where the water went. All right. Welcome. Look, I know it's happy hour. I know you have dinner plans, and I'm gonna just start with that in mind, and I will let you know the whole reason I'm up here is that I hope that you guys go back there to booth 435 and check out Sunry. Thank you. Um, that's the agenda, right? So, we, um, have been partnered with them this past year, and this presentation is really about that partnership and what we, and what we found valuable about that, and hopefully you can do similar. Really it's gonna be 4 simple steps. What was 5 serves challenge? Why were we looking for anything? Uh, number 2, we're gonna talk about tools a little bit and what can feel like, uh, when you're trying to go through the process. Then also the turning point. What was it that we did with Sunry that actually made a difference and why we then chose to, to actually move forward and then of course the results. So PIServe is a financial services company. We're global and we probably, I think it's been said that we touch every household in the United States. I don't know if that's physically true or not, but we have grown and we have merged and we, and we still continue to buy companies and merge. Companies and that has led to over a period of years where we are now multi-cloud we have thousands of accounts we have to manage those globally as well. And so what happens is every time you bring another company together, another, uh, buy another product, you have this permissions tornado for lack of a better word, right? And IAM is difficult and we know because when AI is, is all the hype and, and of course we're a regulated, we work in a regulated industry, so you will always have to prove that you have your cloud under control. And so one of the things that we were trying to implement, especially with the rise of AI because the, uh, you know, uh, everybody wants to know what are you doing about AI? What are you doing about AI. So we had actually tried to implement some controls and we, we, we didn't fully well we made an assumption about some SEP inheritance then turned out it worked that way and we actually took an outage and so this happened like middle of last year right before AWS reinforced and so it just happened to be at reinforce where um I saw I was swag hunting, right? We all we all walk around we look for swag. And in that process I ran across Sundry. There's some thing there called a zombie hunter, and I was attracted to that. And so, you know, walk up and we do some small talk. We exchange, what are you doing? What are you doing here? And, um, but in that process they said we automate. Creation and deployment of SEPs. At that point I forgot about the t-shirt that I was hunting for. I forgot about the sticker. We exchanged numbers. We had a second date. We did a POC with them, and that went great. There was a few cloud formation templates. I think it was like 30 minutes to set up. Ryan, my, my partner has set that up, and it took several days to do the analysis and. When we saw the numbers, which we'll show you more of this in a bit, it was like, hey, wait, there's, there's more to this than just our immediate need. Um, so we said, let's see about buying it. Like, let's continue this relationship. And then this is what happened. Now I'll tell you right up front this has nothing to do with sundry. This was our processes, um, but real questions do we need another tool? Why this tool? Isn't, don't we already have a tool that does that? Who's gonna pay for it even after we get it up and running? Who's gonna operate it? Is it a cyber tool? Is it a cloud infrastructure tool? Like what is it? And so for us, um. The fact that we did the POC and I would encourage you to do a POC is that we had our data right there for us to see and it was easy to do demos with other partners in our business and in particular leadership and when we did work out the fact that Sunry offered something that we didn't have in any other tool in any other way and. And it was even more than that, we decided to, to go ahead. And the reason I brought all of that up is because this is what it feels like sometimes when everything's going on, you're, you're one more meeting, one more question, do we do it again? It's worth it if the if the solution, if any solution here, if it fixes your need, it's worth it. And that to me is why we did that. All right. One second. So this is, this is where I'm gonna spend most of this time. I'm actually gonna explain this. Sorry about that. Um, And I'm only gonna explain enough for you to be interested to go to booth 435. Remember my agenda? So at the top, what you'll see is the scope and the little drop down at the top. You can do that at the root org, any of your OUs, or you can go down to individual accounts. And by the way, these are not our numbers. This is a stock photo, um. Whatever, whatever scope you pick, those numbers will change to reflect what's based on that scope. So what is, what is this? These are hero cards, I assume because you're a hero if you take action on those. The first one is IM users. And rolls with excessive permissions. So the easiest way to say this, this is where we show you all the policies that were probably written with a wild card, right? They're over permission, but in particular, they're not in use. So they're being flagged, not just being over permissive. They're just not being used and you can take action by clicking on that button and it'll stage some stuff it'll do some stuff. I'm not gonna tell you all the stuff that it does that's these guys' uh job, but what it does is it prevents them from being used. And if they try to use them, the, it'll, it'll set off an alert, so to speak, and there's a workflow then that you can take to give people that permission to use those if they need to. But what it does is quickly gives you that con that layer of control. The second one, the whole reason I was hunting those stickers, the zombie hunters, zombies represent, um, identities which haven't been used. It doesn't, it's not about the permission of just not being used, right? It's junk in your accounts and again, much like this protection here, you can quarantine the zombies such that whenever. Somebody try, like if, if say it was a quarterly thing that runs, when that happens, again, there's a workflow, it'll get triggered. Someone can then take action, ask, OK, they can reach out to that to you, hey, I see this alert. What is it? Do you really need it? And there's, and, and again, there's action, automation, and then also the workflow behind it. Those were the things that we didn't have in our system. Um, we don't, by the way, we predate control tower. We have our own control tower, so to speak. And, and this type of stuff wasn't built into that, at least not in this, this way. The 3rd 1 is the one that is what we were really looking for out of the gate, right? We have new services, new AI services coming out. We're gonna leave here. There'll be more, and we can, you can use this to turn them on or turn them off. And so it was nice to be able to see across thousands and thousands of accounts just how much we have. In use, not in use, and then we can drill down to any level. So anytime we're working with one of our teams, one of the app dev teams, we can pull this up and we can get a, a just another view of the data that shows that they have junk in there, over permission stuff in there, and, and do they need that service. So we use that now as part of the AICOE, our center of excellence, that when teams have an AI project, they can come, they get approved, and then we, this is how we turn those services back on for them. Um, The 3rd, or the 3rd parties was actually not something that was on there when we first looked at it. That was something they were adding. Um, And that Or it might have been the regions. I forget now, but anyway, the third part is, the, the nice thing about that is in a single place we can go and we can look in any account and we can see who's partnered with us a lot of, you know, hopefully, hopefully it's all OK, but normally it's been. Vendors, SASS vendors, um, people they have relationships with like Snowflake where you have database connections and things like that, but you can also from there drill down into to see the policies and so that, that is something again to try to go see all of that information the natural way through a query or whatever that's a lot more difficult right here just from this console we can really drill down and if we choose to take action you can block it um so. That takes me then to the regions. Regions is, um, just like it says, every, there's new, there's new regions. AWS brings up good examples like India. For a long time, there's only one region there. In the banking, you need two, you know, for DR we've always struggled with that other region. So when the regions come on, we can now say, hey, do you, this application, does it actually need to be there? Um, so we can control that that way. Um, down at the bottom you'll see are the services. So if, if you click on where you click on up there, the numbers across the bottom or in the service layer will tell you how many people are using it, and you can also drill into, um, the, the, the sensitive permissions. So this is the thing that Sundry's done for us, which is they have people all the time working in the IAM. That's a full-time job and that's just made it very easy for us. We don't have to guess now and we take, we take their sensitive permissions and you can choose to protect again. So the key to all of that is when you take action in the far corner up there, you'll see the deploy button and any, and it'll take you to see what is staged and from there you can deploy it and I'll let them explain exactly how that works. All right, I'm at 20 minutes, so let's just. Finish up here. Real quick. Though I want to point out the lines of code and the hours saved that essentially refers to the fact that if our policy is about 38-40 lines per SEP and we have over 1000 accounts, that's lines of code that we didn't have to copy and paste, change the information and deploy. And if I just calculated an hour per account, we've saved over 1000 hours. So the numbers are probably a lot more than that, but it is a way for you to look at getting, how, how can this tool pay for itself, OK? All right. Uh, with that, I gotta go cause I'm over the time, but thank you, everyone. Uh, you can, I'll stick around, you can talk to me. Sundry guys are at booth 435. Appreciate your time.
