Hello everyone. Um, welcome to DVT 208. Thank you for joining us here today. I'm Ali Maz and I head the go to market for AWSS portfolio of developer services. And today we will be talking about how AI is transforming software development life cycle. We will share some practical frameworks for you to think about this transformation and maturity of this transformation. We will share real world examples about how some of the companies have done this transformation, and towards the end of it, we will also talk a little bit about what the future holds for all of us. Um, So let's get started. This is an image which is super interesting to me, um, and I want you guys to spend 5 to 10 seconds looking at it and imagining this as a parallel to you shipping software. So as you think about it, right, what do you see? It's a busy road, there's a lot of delivery happening, there's a lot of software getting shipped here. What you don't see and what I am sure you don't see in the real world as well, is the backlog that never gets addressed because that is what never comes out. So this is an audience moment for me. So with a show of hands, tell me if you have been part of a developer team where you have had more backlog than you can possibly deliver. Exactly, um, but keep your hands up. Tell me if people who have been in those rooms, um, you have had to sit in gruesome, painful meetings where you have had to take decisions about prioritization. Thank you. So, and so there are things about software development that are very awesome and amazing, but then there are things we never talk about, and there are reasons we don't talk about, um, irrespective, um, if you have agile, you use, um, waterfall, you use kanban or whatever methodology is your flavor of the month. The reality is there is almost always more work than people available to deliver it. Before AI, right, there are only two possible solutions around it. Either you increase the number of people, or you ruthlessly prioritize. The issue with that is that even when you do both together, nothing happens. The problem still persists, um, and so there is this notion in the industry, and I want to, before I introduce the two gentlemen here, I want you to think about this, right? Like this is a notion or a or a situation where we are shipping against capacity and this constraint has defined software development for the last what, 2 decades or 3 decades maybe. So with that, um, the idea of AI driven software development is all about AI taking over the undifferentiated heavy lifting while you and your developers um focus on the critical and the creative aspects of software development. Now I'm sure you would have heard about this a lot of times and today we're not gonna talk about that because that is a boring topic now. Um, as we sort of get into the session, you will see me talk about the problems space, how and why AI matters, and how to think about maturing and that organization that you represent and talk about what maturity looks like. Um, then we have, uh, Mr. Ricardo, Doctor Ricardo from Erickson. He's been leading that effort at Erickson, uh, particularly leveraging Hero CLI to drive about a change in software development processes. Um, and then finally we have, um, Doug, who's the principal product manager for Quiro CLI, and he'll talk to us about what the future holds, um, for us, uh, and for you, and how that future fundamentally redefines how software is going to get shipped in the future. OK, so now that we have set up some kind of a preamble of what we're going to talk about, let's just spend a couple of minutes on how did we get here. So let's sort of all date and age ourselves and go back to the 1980s. Uh, for some of us, at least that's a reality. Um, software development, the way it matured is we started with agile, we start, there was waterfall, then they became agile as Internet speeds came in and all you could ship and update software on the fly. We then sort of realized that developer teams and ops teams need to work together really well, so here you have DevOps, and then we sort of said, OK, you know what, why don't we automate everything and manage only things that matter. And so then we started automating CICD, we started automating testing, and so on and so forth. Now in that journey of 30, 35 years, notice human is almost always at the center. Any tool, any process, anything we do was all about making the developer more efficient. Here comes 2023 and all our worlds changed. Um, and so in that world we started, we get, we ushered into an era that we personally call the bolt on era. You had AI plugged into everything and everything you're writing in code, you need AI to assist you there. You are writing unit tests. You need AI to assist you there. You're doing code reviews. You need AI to assist you there again. No human is still at the center. If you go back to that highway, that road, in that road, the driver is now going faster. That's the intent. Now as we end 2025 and get into the world of 2026, we are now sort of in that era of AI native, and in that world increasingly with LLMs getting smarter and tools getting smarter, we are increasingly getting into the era of asynchronous and autonomous workflows. Now it doesn't mean that anything is going away. It is that things or technology is adding itself into your existing processes. And so now it's not just about technology. What we really need to think about is how do we change processes, how do we change culture. And so before we get there, right, like so far we have sort of talked about Two or three things shipping against capacity, we are moving from human centric to AI native, and the third is remember some of you might remember the capability maturity model right as organizations get into that journey of people and culture change, you need to sort of have a rubric with which you measure where you are in terms of maturity and where you need to be and so. That's the, so hold with me right now. This is where we are. And now let's talk about the few concerns that some of the personas have, right? And that's what our internal teams tell us. That's what our customers tell us. That's what you tell us. And so 28 million developers out there, they talk about, hey, an unprecedented change is coming to my industry. I don't know how to be prepared now. Some of those developers are also practitioners or managers. They have evaluated for the last two years 12 or 13 or 14, you know, number is just a number, um, development tools, and they are concerned about reliability. They almost always compare these tools at a point in time and by the time their evaluation is complete, the product has fundamentally changed and so they are concerned about real reliability. Now when you go to the top, you talk to the CEOs, uh, CTOs, CIOs, CFOs. They basically understand the value of AI, but for them it is all about scaling it across the organization. All of them, so think about it, right? Like developers are worried about relevancy, practitioners, managers, middle tier is, is, is worried about relevancy, and C-level executives are worried about scale. But underlying all of this is one big question that they're all asking, and that's to us, that's the common root for all of us. And that question is, how do I achieve a paradigm shift rather than a step increment, and this is it. That is the question that matters. Everyone can add another AI tool to their toolbox. It's a step increment. It does not fundamentally change the way you are going to think about software today. The debate and the discourse is all about how can I make my development processes or developer 10% more effective. You know what? I will be awesome if I make it 15% more effective. How about 18, but that's not the problem. I think that's we're still thinking too small. I think where we are going in 2026 and beyond is about 10x thinking, 10x creativity, and I think that requires a paradigm shift and it's not just about performance improvements or doing it faster. And so the answer, right? The answer for us um is we prepare the development teams of tomorrow by positioning AI as the central collaborator. That does not mean that the human is out of the loop. All it means is that AI is orchestrating in the Bolt-on era you were, you had AI that was acting like a GPS. So if human centric design developer is designing or working, AI is the GPS that guides, so you accomplish the task faster. In the world of AI being the orchestrator, the relationship completely flips, and once it flips, uh, the paradigms are different. I'll give you an example. So today AI is not just an assistant, right in this world, in this world of AI Native, it is actually a collaborator. It is participating with you in planning. It is helping you decompose complex requirements into tasks. It is also helping you design or create architectural patterns that are relevant to your situation. So for all practical purposes, it's no longer an assistant but a peer. Is no longer a tool, but somebody sitting right next to you and once you it's it requires a little mental shift, but once you make that mental shift, possibilities is open because if you go back to that highway, now you have literally created another lane. And that's where it's not humans driving, it's somebody else driving while humans are still. So now the question really is, should we as developers be worried? I don't think so. Quite the contrary. It's actually elevating the developer from just a practitioner to something that they do really well, which is. Decision making, which is all about insight, which is about validation. You've got to be there to steer the lane that AI is operating on more efficiently and more productively. And so now let's sort of culminate this into a very simple framework, right? It's as simple as this gets is you have AI assisted development. This is where 2023 started and you are there now. We are increasingly getting into this area of AI driven development where AI is taking the role of the central orchestrator and you humans are staged around it and in that world. You're now moving from the realm of individual productivity to system level or team level productivity, and now the, the, the area where we nobody is and we will probably get is the AI managed development. In the AI managed development, think of that highway. And now think about all the lanes being run by AI and human is sitting on the side making sure all the decisions are being validated, all the right sort of structures are being insured, and the system integrity is ensured, and so roles are going to morph, and that's what we think, but this is another way of sort of thinking about where you are in that journey in terms of your organizations. And so, now, um, sort of, I will um give the floor to um Doctor Ricardo, who actually is leading that effort real-time. Um, how long has it been? 6 months since you've started this journey? 12 months. So who better than to um talk about it from a real world example point of view than Mr. Ricardo? Over to you, sir. Thanks a lot. So I have a surprise for you because I think we have such a nice audience and we are prepared here, you know, for more like a rave party, right? So I just talked to Steve Aoki to come here and give a show for us here in the like 30 minutes we have. No, I'm just kidding. We're gonna talk about Eric's journey here. Yeah, so thanks a lot, Ali and for the invitation to be here with you today. Um, as you said, we in Erickson have started this journey, um, quite some time ago, and it's a journey that we have had actually many people contributing towards its success, I should say we have even colleagues here in the audience like Doug and other people who have been also kind of doing great work in the parts of Exxon to also help the company to be successful in this whole AI transformation, but you know. To add the kind of context here, the first thing I'm going to ask you is. How many of you have heard of Eriksson before? Can you raise your hands? Yeah, quite many. Maybe if it was, uh, years ago, I think the complete audience probably would raise their hands. Um, we used to be in the consumer market back in the days, we have very nice uh mobile phones, probably the best in the market, but basically consumer market was never really our core business, and then. We, we decide at some point to, to focus really on our core business which is actually to provide top class, uh, high performance networks. So, in one picture, uh, I'm trying to give you the scale of how, let's say impactful Exxon is to the world. Around 50% of the entire 5G traffic outside China. In the rest of the world is actually going through Ericsson Networks as we speak right now, so we're talking about billions of subscribers that are using Ericsson products even though they don't know that. So probably if you are navigating, you know, the web right now, you are using uh indirectly some of our, our products in the market, more specifically. I'm part of uh one group in Exxon that's responsible for the products that actually help the operators to monetize their networks because basically it's not enough really, you know, to have the top radio equipment and etc. that Exon provides you need to have software on top of that to be able to make money out of your networks. So here in the US, AT&T, T-Mobile US, Verizon, etc. Those are examples of cosmos we have, and then. In this part of Ferguson that I'm kind of uh supporting the the organization there, we are actually delivering products to to those big operators and also small operators in the world to enable them to sell whatever products they they want to sell to the subscribers to deliver. The services in the best way possible enabling a very smooth experience for those subscribers and of course to get paid right because they are here to make money then we are helping them to to monetize things but you know the the reality is this is very hard type of software to develop. Both here where I'm in Ericson, but even let's say globally when we talk about telco, uh, it's, it's very complex and then it's complex. C is just going up because there are every day just more expectations. People want to have extremely low latency in their networks. They want to have endless amount of data flowing, you know, through, through the networks, and they don't want to pay much for that actually. So then how we have those operators to provide great service, it's a challenge. And then we need to actually keep improving ourselves to provide to our customers, the operators, best in class products and really fight in a very fierce market and then. Basically just kind of know the traditional ways of developing software, they're not enough anymore. And then I tell you even more than that if you just kind of bring, you know, AI tools to your kind of set of process and etc. that will not help you either. You need to think beyond that and how you can actually transform how you actually introduce AI in your ways of working and then basically bring to light what we call. AI in nature of software development. So In, in practice, what we call here AI native software development is in a way back to basics. So basically In the context where we develop software, as I said, we are handling very complex systems, right? We have thousands of engineers working together around the globe, so it's very hard to have those AI principles, the small teams working very close together. No handovers, you know, and etc. People just doing things end to end because those seasons are just too complex and then. In AI and nature of software development, then we introduce a set of agents that actually help to handle this complexity associated with developing those very complex systems so that I can actually be true AI even in large scale software development, which is the case of Ericson. Another thing that's very important to highlight here is in AI nature of software development I'm able actually to. Do an extreme version of what scholarship left that you all here probably have heard about where I'm able to introduce quality from the very first day until the very end when I'm releasing whatever new requirement in my product basically having those agents supporting doing the process of designing the solutions I need to put in place, uh, supporting the process here to develop the code following whatever conventions I need to follow. Reviewing solutions and the code in real time to make sure I'm actually taking into consideration very early whatever nonfunctional requirements that I need to take into consideration throughout the entire life cycle of my features. So the AINH is about having, let's say, um, nonfunctional um aspects being taken into consideration from the very first day. And then we are making sure here that we are not, let's say catching um coaching things we make sure that we're getting code done right in a way it doesn't matter if we are coaching or an agent is doing that on our behalf. What matters is we are fulfilling those requirements we need to provide in the best way possible with the right quality level and with the right time to market. Then basically here. We have established a blueprint that includes the 7 agents that you can see here of course you could do this in various ways. This is the way we have done. And this is the way we're doing today is you would this be the same forever? Oh, there is a chance we keep evolving this, right? And then maybe we're gonna add other agents, but today those 7 agents, they, they are the ones we have. Then basically they, as I said to you before here those agents, they have different skills. Then basically we keep adding skills so that those agents can help the. Um, cross-functional chain that will be developing each requirement end to end to take into consideration, as I said, those especially again I'm highlighting a lot non-functional requirements because those are the, the hard ones to take into consideration very early in the software development process. We tend to focus a lot on functional for obvious reasons, but if we don't have actually and not focused on nonfunctional, we know what happens later on in whatever development process that we need to, to kind of put forward. So here those agents are really helping us to focus on especially nonfunctional, very, very early in this process here and then basically starting there having product managers working very close together. With the engineers, the reason I, I even highlighted in red here, you know, I was talking to my manager, and then, but why you have the product manager there in red? We don't like those guys, no problems here though. I like you. I I kid you, right? But the pro the problem is there is always, you know, a kind of, uh, let's say, uh, debate between the engineers and the product managers because they have different responsibilities. They need to focus on different things and they have the. Let's say let's focus and at times they are not focusing on the same thing, right? And very often they are not close enough and then in air and age of software development, the product managers, they need to be here together really with the software development teams because again we want to do things end to end. I'm developing one requirement. I want to see it realized from the very, very beginning here when product manager is actually. You know, kind of pushing out a specific requirements, helping to clarify what needs to be done there, and then following up that until the very end when I'm actually releasing that software, taking into consideration whatever again nonfunctional aspects that I need to take into consideration, security, performance, UX, you name it. And then basically here is where we we have had, let's say great support from AWS to realize this. Because we, we have been working together with AWS from the very beginning when this product was you called Code whisper. And I tell you, it was a bit painful beginning because the tool was not where our engineers expected it to be. And then they were kind of complaining. I'll be very open here. Why are we using this crap? I said, no guys, not crap and this starting now, right? We're in the beginning of the journey. Give it, give it some time. No, but I want this. I said, no, you want too much. Give it some time. We have the confidence this will improve fast. And of course, in a very open relationship with AWS guys have showed us time and time again that they had what would take, you know, to, to evolve this product very quickly, and they deliver it. So today we are now the name of the Prosquiro, as you probably know. And then there was actually uh uh uh let's say kind of a big breakthrough around April when AWS introduced by that time it was called QCLI so basically providing agentic capabilities to this product. And you have heard a lot of hype about agents, right? It's everywhere. People are talking about agents here and there. You know, even an agent you put some coffee or some biscuits and etc. right? We don't need to go that far, of course, but you know, the thing is. This is really a game changer, and I tell you, before and after, day and night. Before QCLI QCLI nowadays with IGHT capabilities, um, was there, our engineers, they, they were not as excited about using. Um, this type of tool in the soft development development cycle. After that we had to start stopping you guys. No guys, wait a bit, we need to take into consideration a bit, a little bit of security aspect this and that. You cannot just go on your own because everyone got so excited. About having actually entity capabilities supporting them in realizing the ideas, helping them to let the creativity flow, right? So, so this was really a game changer. And then of course the other two things that actually make this really spectacular I can even say. Is actually Combining the right context that we give to the agents that we have here that are operationalized using Kiru CLI. But also giving access to tools because if we, if we don't do that, then you are limiting it, right? It's like your agent has no arms. How much you can do without that, right? So here this uh model context protocol has been the other let's say breakthrough that has helped to bring things to the next level and then we the combination of these that we call system knowledge playing where we actually provide more digested information to the agents here so that they know about our products otherwise they would never know really. I, I hope that's the case they'll not know about our secret sauce right in our products. I cannot expect it's there in Quiro because if it's there we have a big problem, right? And then I need to provide that and it's more than just, you know, giving access to everything. It was just too much talking about millions and millions of lines of code here guys and of course lines of code. To have a terrible code base, maybe it doesn't mean much, right, but just to give a sense of scale. We're talking about millions, large, massive products here, so I cannot just give you everything. I need to help the tool here to really know where to look. And that's what we do with this system knowledge plan where we have developed a few knowledge graphs and basically provide this kind of digested type of information at the right time to to Kiro so that it will help us to realize those features we need to develop and then together with the tools then we we can achieve a lot here using this product. So I will ask again another question to you. Um, how many of you are using QCLI, uh, using MCP servers, etc. How has been your experience so far? Do you like it? Hm? Yeah, but maybe what we're missing is exactly the system knowledge plane that we have here, right? But then one thing is We're talking about thousands of people in Exxon that we are going through this transformation now and then, you know, many people, they are kind of excited and they are kind of going on their own, right? But with this entire work we're doing here, what we're trying to do is we're trying to kind of raise the bar so that everyone starts from a much higher baseline. So that I can have as many 10 factor engineers in the company as possible. And the ones that are in factory engineers today, they will become maybe 100 factory engineers or 1000 factory engineers, right? But then globally we're gonna actually enab be enabling here the community of engineers in the company to achieve much more, but I need your help. Let's say those people should know where they are. And then basically we have introduced. Uh, matuation model that basically helps with people to, to compare right where they are today to where they need to be. And then This is actually very simple. We have 4 levels here. First level is software development with AI. We just give access to the tools, people start exploring using best effort, you know, best way they can. Then the the second level. I started providing templates, access to some MCP servers, and etc. so that rather than just spinning around and oh my God, what is the best way, where I should start, etc. people already have a good starting point really to start having impact then the, the second level. I, I add the, let's say more dynamic agents there plus the system knowledge plane where I have those graphs that I showed in the previous slide that actually provide the right context at the right time. Finally, I actually merge this technical enablement. With a complete revamp of how the teams are organized and how they should behave, and then we finally achieve what we call here AI and age of software development where I really transformed completely the process of developing software by introducing agents again natively in in the ways of working really transform whatever we have there today. So How we really do that? You know, technology is essential here and here of course we have this great partnership with AWS. We are working very well together and then that's a, a key element to it. And then we also at times we, you know, realize we actually need to do some things, some stuff ourselves, and then we, when we should do that, we do that. But that's part of the story. Without the other two pillars you see here. Without proper really change management, you know, where you, you have the right governance approach in place, it's very hard to change a large organization. You don't need this kind of type of very structured approach if you have maybe 5-10 people, but if you have 1000 people, if you have 10,000 people, sorry my friends, you never succeed introducing a big change like this, so you need to have really a formal governance approach to be successful here. And finally, if you actually part of this change approach, we don't focus on the cultural side of things. Again, you'll not be successful because this really requires people to think differently. You probably find yourself like, oh, I have worked like this for 15 years and it just works for me. Why I'm gonna change, right? But you can do better and that's what we're saying here and then we need to help people to realize and understand they can actually do better and then how you do that? You need to help people. We need to help them to upskill themselves. You need to give the right incentives, right? You need to use this as well in even your performance management of people. And at the same time, again, I said we provide some good baseline to people. We should not shift innovation. Let people innovate. They will bring things here. They will surprise you and tell you that then you realize that what you started here like this, it will just explode and then you know it will be bigger than what you thought in the beginning, so. Basically to wrap up here. It's not about replacing people. It's about augmenting people, right? As I said, I want to have 10 factor engineers everywhere in my organization. It's about Get you the code done, not about coaching again. AI will be more and more doing that path for us, but we still are in the driver's seat here. We still need to be behind, you know, be accountable for whatever goes through here. But then having the support of those agents will actually make the difference. And then, you know, I can give some numbers here about this transformation there I said I'm showing the numbers connected to my part of Erickson, which is one kind of part of a very large company, right? But we have other parts of X like in dogs organization, etc. Also the transformation happening as well. So if I see X as a whole, the numbers are even bigger. But of course I'm talking about the ones I'm responsible for. So we have 1,500+ engineers already using design approach here. So making use of some of the agents, we don't have all those agents yet because it is a journey. We have heard of spec-driven development, right? Uh, AI and H is a, kind of, uh, it's bigger than that. So, um, spec-driven development is part of it, right? So we, we have some of the agents already there and people already using and help you, help us, you know, to keep evolving that. And then we already see the benefits. So rather than weeks to have software specifications in place, now we can have it in some cases in hours or just a few days. Software testing, troubleshooting can be very tricky. Imagine I said in the beginning these are very complex systems. Here we're seeing some situations even weeks. It's not because people are not good, I tell you we have great engineers in Erickson. It's just that the complexity is too big. But then now with the support of AI, those agents helping us here to read it in weeks, in some cases, a few days, even hours helping us to troubleshoot and test things. Are we done? Not at all. We are just kind of, you know, going through this journey as I speak here. We have already achieved a lot, but we know we're gonna achieve even more, and it's where Doug actually will talk more about what is yet to come when it comes to Kiru and how it will help us in our journey. Thank you. Yeah, thanks Ricardo. I really appreciate, uh, your insights and you just learning a little bit more about Erickson and, and, and your journey and how you've adopted this AI native. Now my name's Doug Clause and I'm the product manager for the Quiro CLI, and I'm going to walk you through how we're building that future of AI development here at AWS. I wanna start from Ricardo's last slide and talk a bit more about how we see Quiro, which you know you've heard about a few times, how we see it fit into this picture. So we wanna, we wanna support you across all three of these initiatives, but the reality is, as Ricardo said, that change management and the cultural shift are likely very unique to your organization. For example, you know, your governance requirements are unique or your legal frameworks might vary by an industry or or a different region, and your culture and, and how you see yourselves adopting AI is something that really only you can define. What we think is a bit more universal is that technology layer, and that's where we've been actively investing in building over the last couple of years, you know, that's the tools and the infrastructure and the capabilities that will enable this AI driven development. Now I'm excited to show you today how Quiro can provide that technology foundation, but before I jump into a few demos, I wanna level set on what Quiro is and what you can do with it. So Quiro gives you flexibility in how you want to work, and we have both agentic IDE as well as an agentic CLI that's gonna integrate AI development from prototype to production. I'm gonna talk about the IDE first. So we just launched this in preview earlier this summer. We launched it in GA, uh, on November 17th, and one of the coolest features to me of the Quiro IDE is that it has this structured spec-based development where Quiro can guide you through the requirements, definition, the design, and then the implementation. Anybody tried that? See a few? Good. What, what I think is what Quiro forces you to do is align on the spec first, and then Quiro executes the plan step by step after that, or you can choose to use a conversational chatter as the term came up, vibe coding. You can vibe code as well and then iterate on that. It's really your choice. You choose how you wanna work. You can also automate workflows with a feature that we call agent hooks. Now agent hooks trigger on you set them up on what you want them to trigger on, and then they take an autonomous action after that. So just it's probably easiest to explain by an example. So if anyone has ever worked with localization files where they help your app work across, excuse me, across multiple different languages, it can be a lot to keep them up to date. The agent hooks solve that problem. So you know you can set up an agent hook so that whenever your English localization file gets updated, the hook triggers and automatically updates your other localization files as well, keeping everything in sync. And these agent hooks allow you to, uh, they focus on those repetitive tasks, allowing you to focus on other things. And then finally, the context management, you know, feed Kiro your documentation, connect the MCP servers like Ricardo showed you. Uh, share UI designs help Kiro understand your whole project context, not just an isolated request. On the context side too, Quiro can automatically generate what we call steering files, and steering files are a summarization of your project, but also give you the ability to customize how you want Quiro to build. The result here with the Kiiro IDE is you get an AI assistant in the IDE which adapts to your way of working and not the other way around. Now, before the demo, I do wanna talk just a tiny bit more about spec driven development and why we feel like it matters. Here we go. So what aspective development? Spect driven development means creating specifications as the central artifact of your development process. It's really not new and in fact, I would, I would argue that most of us have done it before. It's just this whole introduction of vibe coding has caused us to sort of walk away from it. So spectrum spectrum development is a set of proven principles and formal requirements, but it introduces AI agents or it's it, the introduction of AI agents has made it even more important to sort of cycle back to this. As I mentioned, tra traditional vibe coding with an AI is great for prototyping or maybe a low risk task, and it focuses a lot on that implementation phase. But really less on the other aspects of software development which are just as important. You can iterate fast, you can generate lots of code and maybe you get a working solution, but what it does do sometimes as well is if it's a complex task, especially, it creates this stream of consciousness problem where you know your design and requirements get buried in the chat log, your requirements of what you started with and now drifted to something else, and 6 months later you come back to it and nobody knows why you built what was built because there's no documentation to go with it. Anyone had this issue even without AI, right? This happens, so, uh, I know certainly we have as well. Now spec driven development solves this. Specs create a, they serve as a contract between you and Quiro, and Quiro translates your natural language into a structured format that will preserve the intent while being actionable by the agents under the hood. Now the result is higher quality output with better alignment between you and Kiiro. I think it's easiest to see this as a demo, so let me show you what it looks like. So as I mentioned, Quiro supports vibe-based development. Oops, there it started. But for this then we're gonna use spec mode with Quiro assisting us through this process. We're gonna start by submitting a new prompt just like we would with tell it what we wanna build. In this case, we're building an events planning app, and we wanna add the ability to add a category to these events and then sort by the category. And this change is gonna require some database updates and some new UI components, so Kiiro is gonna analyze that prompt and get to work. Now to access Quiros specific features in the IDE, the easiest way is to navigate to that Quiro tab, and here you'll find the features I mentioned before like the specs, the steering, and the hooks. We're gonna click on our spec. Now specs generate 3 key deliverables, requirements, design, and then the implementation of the task list. We're gonna start with requirements. These are structured as user stories with well-formed acceptance criteria, and you have the opportunity to review these for completeness, and modify them as you see fit. In this case, I saw that it wasn't going to display any events that had no category, so I'm asking you to make that change. I type in natural language. And Kro's going to make that required update to the acceptance criteria. And there we go. So with these requirements finalized, we're gonna move on to the design, by clicking that move to the design face button. Now the design outlines high level components like the API routes, the air handling strategies or testing strategies. Now you can modify this. Or you continue to the task list. Overall, this looks really good to me, so we're gonna move forward by clicking that move to implementation plan button down in the lower right. And it's going to create our task list. Here we go. And here's the task list. So notice the requirements traceability here. So it's linking each task back to the specific requirements that it's addressing. And now Kiiro gives us a choice. It wants to know, do we wanna build the MVP or do we wanna build everything at the same time? If you know anything about how we like to build an Amazon, we call them MLPs, the minimum lovable product. You've probably heard that a few times, so we're gonna choose the MVP first. With that selection, Kiiro's going to automatically go through, update that that implementation plan, the requirements, and the design to that new MVP scope, and we're ready to get going. So you, you, you start building by clicking the start task button on any of those tasks in the task list. This gives you control over the execution, letting you verify each task individually as it becomes completed. Now our first task here is gonna create the category model. And so we're gonna go ahead and it's asking to run a Python helper script if it can run that help that helper script, so we're gonna let it do that. And it's running and I fast forwarded a little bit here, but you can see the code is all generated. The tests are passing, so we're in good shape here. It's also asking now to run another command because it wants to validate that the database schema was run properly, if you see there in the lower right again asking if it can run a command. So we're gonna give it approval for that. And now with the test passing and the database schema validation done, this task, this task is complete and you see it marks the task is complete up top. It's really that easy. Now again, I did a little bit of demo magic here and I fast forward through some parts, but I think you'll find for some of these larger tasks that these specs add some structure that to what you're building. It'll feel familiar if you've done this before. It'll give you the features you're looking for and it'll also help you build some additional artifacts along the way that will help others understand the future why you did something that you did. Now I mentioned this up front, but Quiro is more than an IDE, and, and you know Ericson's one of our, uh, great customers on the CLI. So let's talk about the CLI as well. So the Kro CLI is your AI powered companion that lives right in your terminal. First, it handles your complete workflow from planning and and debugging issues, writing code, deployments, all without switching any context between different tools or interfaces. Second, and probably my favorite thing is it adapts to how you work. You can build custom agent profiles and use steering files that match your team's standards, your performance frameworks, or your specific use cases. It's really not a one size fits all. It's configured to your workflow. These custom agents are the thing that Doctor Ricardo just talked about in using and what he built with their security expert and their architecture expert and their user experience expert. It's all built on top of the the CLI. They're a game changer because they let you adopt AI driven development the way you want to adopt it as opposed to what a a a more structured approach would take. Here's a real example going back to the steering files of me using the steering files and just an application that I was building for fun. So I was building a Nex JS application on Bracell, uh, and for those that aren't familiar, each request that you make, like loading a URL costs you what they call an edge request from your quota. Kiiro, which wrote all of the code, was using a capability of NexGS called prefetching, which was automatically loading all of the linked pages on the, on each of the pages that got loaded, which is fine, except for that it was costing me an extra request every for every linked page that was getting loaded. Now as my project evolved and got bigger and I had a lot of linked pages, it was costing me far more edge requests than I wanted to, and honestly for me the the pages were simple and it was a fun project, so it wasn't worth the quota that I was spending on that. So how do I disable that? I use my Quiro steering files and I told it that I don't wanna do prefetching anymore. And now even if I forget to tell Quiro as I'm building something that and it starts creating links, I get no more prefetching because it's in my steering files and it's something that I wanna do. And then third, the KOCLI is context aware and it can share a context with the IDE as well, so you could feed it your documentation, your MCP servers, those UI designs we talked about. And it will understand that full project context. The result of the CLI is that, you know, you stay in flow in your terminals. So for those that like the terminal-based experiences, this is the one I'd suggest that you try, um, but it understands your way of working and it's very, very adaptable as well. So again, I'm gonna show you now a demo of my like probably my favorite features of custom agents because they've been so powerful in helping customers adapt the way they wanna be developing. All right, so here we are in the chiro CLI. And I'm specifically going to show you, like I said, those customs agents. So the CLI works off of what we call tools and MCP servers. So a tool is something that allows it to take a command like reading or writing a file or searching a website. So I'm showing you those, the tools that are loaded are trusted for the default agent. I've also got a bunch of custom agents that I built for special purposes for me, so I have a Jira assistant, I have a security officer, I have a solutions architect, and I also have this DevOps agent that I just swapped into. This is changing the way the CLI is working based on how that DevOps agent is configured. Let's take a look at how it's configured. So it has a set of pre-approved tools and MCP servers, and it also has a custom prompt, which tells the CLI how I want it to behave and how I want it to work. Let's look at that custom prompt as well. So in this case, you see, it's very verbose. I gave it very specific about how I want to build infrastructures code for my project. Now, I'm no infrastructures code expert. And so one of the things that I added oftentimes in my files is I when it proposes a solution, I want it to tell me why that deployment strategy is the right thing to go do. This helps me learn as I go, but also helps Kira be a bit more critical about the actions it's taking. So now I'm showing you the MCP servers that got loaded because we were switched into this agent, and then you'll see here that from before that, the, um, the tools are also slightly changed. So now I'm gonna ask this DevOps agent to generate infrastructures code templates. So in Terraform for this project and this is the same project we were working before with this events based planning app. And this would have taken me honestly hours and, and maybe for me probably even days like I am not an infrastructure code expert and my ability to write terraform is not good, right? Um, while I know what I want to do, the specifics of doing it are something that I'm not great at. But here you're gonna see the DevOps agents creating all of this from scratch, and these terraform templates again are not, they're, they're not generic terraform templates, they're custom built for me based on what I requested. Alright, so we're gonna let this build for a second. I've also told it, I don't know if you caught this up front, but I also told it what I pre-approved and what I, uh, allow it to do on its own, so I gave it the ability to read files, but upfront I had to give it approval to write any files. So we'll get just a few more seconds to complete. And while it's doing that, just remember these are built like these are custom built for me based on how I've configured that agent. So if you want something different, you build it differently. And now you can see it's complete. It's complete. It's giving me now a summary of, of what was got, excuse me, giving me a summary of what got built and then what I needed to do next, because again, that's how I told it, so I wanted it to work. Again, these custom agents are super powerful, and as I've already called out, they let you build how you want to build. They're flexible and if you haven't tried them, give them a shot. Um, you can write a very long and verbose file about how you want to build and it will follow all your rules when you're building that and they've allowed a number of customers, including Ericsson to sort of build their AI driven development processes the way that they want to build them. Now we've been using, as I'm sure you imagine, um, we've been using the Kiro ID and the CLI for a long time, even before we released it, and so we have some tips and tricks that might help you just build a little bit faster. First and probably most important, provide the context up front. Don't just ask a question. Share the relevant files. Paste an error message. Paste a compiler error. Um, be even better, create a custom agent to change the way it works based on how you want to build. The more context Kiiro has about your environment and goals, the more accurate response you're gonna get and the happier you're going to be. And also be very specific about constraints, so tell it your security requirements, tell it your preferred programming languages. If you're building production, tell it what production ready means for you. Be very specific and it will work with that. But don't make hero guess, you know, oftentimes, uh, I, when I work with folks in teams, they're typing a single line of, you know, generate this API, and then they're like, Well, that's not the result I wanted, and I'm like, Well, but you didn't really tell it what you wanted. You just told you something very simple, right? So be very specific in this. This customization and and the way you prompt is very important to get the results that you want. Second thing, start with specifications for production code. This will emphasize good workflow hygiene up front, and it prevents, you know, the generate everything and hope it works. I'm sure we've all done this before, um, or the YOLO pattern as I like to call it, um, reviewing these specs gives you and your team something to look at prior to the code getting generated, and oftentimes it's easier to look through natural language and a set of requirements than it is to look through the code to figure out did it meet all of those use cases, right? In this position, this will position Kiro more as a, a, um, discipline development, a piece of a discipline development process rather than just an ad hoc code generator as Alie talked about around those bolt-on solutions, right? This is not what we're looking for. Third, iterate and verify. This is a conversation. Review what gets generated, test it in your environment, and refine. Even better, shift everything to the left. Give Kiro the ability to run your unit test. Give it the ability to run your integration test. Give it the ability to shift your application and if you're using any canaries, run those canaries, see the output, let it then regenerate a solution until it has a working solution and let it provide that to you. Uh, it's really, it's really, um, your expertise combined with Quiro here that's going to drive the best solutions, but everything you can shift left will help you get a better answer earlier than the process. And then 4th, and probably another very important one, use it for the right tasks. So Kiro excels at generating code as we've talked about and plans and researching options and helping debug issues or maybe even exploring alternatives, but you're the team lead. You excel at knowing what done looks like and you're responsible for assigning work. The more you use Quiro, the better you're gonna understand what it does well. And if you can, if you get to the point where you understand what it does well, it's just like working with a new colleague or maybe learning a new programming language, um. It takes some time to understand how to make how to work with the AI, but as you start to learn that you'll get better and better at at prompting what you want and the solution. And you'll get even better results. And then for example I've been talking about partnership, um, going back to the project that I was building, um, I wanted users to see the latest information on my web app so this is kind of an embarrassing story for me since I just told you guys all these things to do and I didn't do it myself, uh, so I asked Kira to help, but I didn't dive deep enough into what it had built and I tried it and it seemed like it was working. All the web pages were getting updated near real time and I'm like, oh this is working perfectly, so I shipped it and I should, I should also say keep in mind this is just something for fun, not a production app. I would, I wouldn't do that. Next morning I checked my Vercell dashboard and I saw thousands of edge requests and again this is a personal project. There's no way I had that many visitors, so what happened? Well, I didn't look at the implementation and Quiro had shipped uh the ability to um. If the client side pulling on all of my sites so that when any of my web pages were open every single minute on any browser that had the site open was asking for a new version of the site consistently so that's what that's where my wizard request went, right? And I learned my lesson about the oversight and the partnership and like not passing all of the judgment onto the AI because that's not something that I wanted to do. The bottom line is Quiro is gonna work best when you use it as as a skilled collaborator and not a replacement for your judgment. Oh. It's not going forward. Oh, you gotta click out of there. Here we go. So I want to close out by coming back to where we started. I changed the slide just a little bit from where we started, but we're at an inflection point for how software gets built. You know, Quiro can handle the orchestration of development and the planning, the task breakdown, and the code generation. The transformation is about you making the architectural decisions and you're validating what gets built solves the problem. You're validating that what gets built is what your customers need. You're providing the judgment and direction that Quiro is not replicating today. What I'm really excited for is the top circle of this, right? We're in this AI driven development today, but we're just getting started. So today's Quiro's assisting and orchestrating based on your direction, but we're moving towards this AI managed development world where Quiro doesn't just execute based on your plan, but proactively considers other alternatives, so maybe suggests improvements, and then even potentially takes autonomous action based on your performance or real world user data. So imagine that future where Kira's not asking for your approval and doesn't wait for you to ask, but instead it's asking or it's telling you what needs your attention and where it needs help. So with Kiiro we feel like we're not and we don't think you will be just writing code faster. It's more about building better software with more context, more consistency, and more of what matters to your customers. So we think AI driven development is here and we're super excited to see what you guys do with it. Thank you. If you have any questions, we're gonna stick around up front for a few minutes, so come see us.
