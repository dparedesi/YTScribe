>> Thanks, Dave. Hi, I'm Payam Mirrashidi at Apple. We're
driven by the idea that the products and services we create
should help people unleash their creativity and potential.
We build some of the largest internet services on the planet,
and many of them run on AWS. My team works on services such as
App Store, Apple Music, Apple TV, and podcasts. The service
has billions of you use every day, and what I like to call
the fun stuff. We also build the underlying Cloud
infrastructure across AWS and our own data centers. That
makes it all possible. Wow. That's a lot of technology
power on one slide, and not just the kind you see in the F1
move, but the kind that powers experiences for billions of
users all over the world. And that's why we're always looking
for ways to optimize how we develop and deliver our
services. Now, many of you are navigating a hybrid world,
balancing your own infrastructure with the power
of AWS. And let me tell you, at Apple, we get that. We face the
same pressures and challenges you do. We're in a massive
operation. We're tackling the same problems scalability,
performance and reliability. And we're solving it with AWS.
Like many of you, my journey as a developer started with coding
in C, and then in 2002, when I joined Apple as an engineer on
the original iTunes store, where a Java shop. We're a
small team with big dreams that had to change how the world
consumed music. Over the years, we mostly stuck with Java and
when we needed more performance, we use C++. But it was, well,
cumbersome to develop and even more difficult to support at
scale in production. And as our services scaled, we also face
new coding challenges. The tools we had when always up to
the task. Now, around the same time, Apple's own operating
system team was creating Swift, initially the premiere language
for developing the apps you know and love on your iPhones
and Macs. Swift's performance, modern design, and built in
safety features reveal this potential for server side
development. Now I know introducing a new language,
especially on the server, can raise eyebrows, but with Swift,
a single developer can often handle both client and server
side. You can turn client side logic into a library, run it
server side, maintaining a single code base. The power of
having the same logic on both client and server is immense,
and I think you'll find it incredibly valuable for your
teams to. Today. Apple uses Swift to power everything from
Apple Silicon all the way up to the pixels rendered on your
screen. It's with this easy to learn scales beautifully from
embedded systems to massive architectures, and is perfect
for building distributed services or complex system
software. Apple is processing billions of requests per day,
with apps built in Swift running directly on AWS
Graviton. We've seen a 40% increase in performance and a
30% reduction in cost by rewriting core services in
Swift and moving workloads to graviton. The transition from
x86 has been seamless, with a near drop in replacement for
Java thanks to graviton. Apple moved to ARM more than a decade
ago to power our devices, and now we're seeing the same value
moving to ARM based graviton. To get more out of our
infrastructure, higher throughput means fewer
instances, lower costs, and a smaller footprint. A win for
our customers and for the planet. A great example is our
spam detection feature in iOS 26. We use Swift on Graviton to
scale the compute heavy operations behind the service
that helps us detect suspicious phone numbers while maintaining
privacy for hundreds of millions of users. In fact, the
messages app running on your phone, the spam detection
feature running on the server are using the same language and
scaling seamlessly. This feature is built with
homomorphic encryption using a Swift library that we open
sourced, enabling private and secure computation of data
without the server ever decrypting it. This allows us
to handle massive volumes of data and protect billions of
users with incredible speed. In an era of vibe coding and AI
development. The languages we choose are critical, so it's
legibility and safety. Make it a great addition to your AI
toolbox. Ten years ago this month, we open sourced Swift
and shared this incredible language with the world and the
response has been remarkable. Today, Swift is available on
Linux, windows, Android and more. It's embraced by a
vibrant community, and millions of developers globally are
building apps from everything from devices to data centers.
It's time to consider Swift for your next project. Check out
Swift.org for language that's fast, expressive, and safe.
Running on the next generation infrastructure of AWS and
graviton. And in case you haven't heard, there's now a
native Swift toolchain available for Amazon Linux the
first distribution to have an official package to the AWS and
Swift on server community. Thank you for your vision and
your partnership. I'd also like to thank Dave for having me
here today. We can't wait to see what you all create with
Swift on AWS Graviton. Thank you.
>> And thank you, Payam. The
