  Nick O’Brien and Keith Grimm explain how AWS is using agentic AI to accelerate workload modernization for customers and partners, aiming to satisfy “divinely discontent” stakeholders who want more choice, lower cost, and faster delivery. O’Brien highlights CEO pressure for innovation, the value at stake, and early proof points: AWS applying its own agentic tools across 10,000 internal application transformations, saving nearly 5,000 developer-years; Thomson Reuters cutting mainframe tech debt 50% while transforming 1.5 million lines of code per month; and partner Calance reducing migration timelines for customer NetSmart. He frames partner funding programs (OLA, MAP, POCs, open-source incentive funds) designed to de-risk assessments, mobilization, and modernization while moving away from purely labor-driven approaches.
  
  Grimm introduces the AWS Transform suite, positioned around the classic assess–mobilize–migrate phases. Transform for Assessment brings agentless inventory, cost modeling, and a downloadable business case directly into the AWS Console within ~15 minutes, avoiding the friction of prior request-based processes. Transform for VMware automates discovery, wave planning, network mapping from on-prem hard-coded IPs into VPC constructs, and execution via AWS MGN to land VMs on EC2, helping customers exit VMware licensing and rightsize quickly. Transform for full-stack Windows modernization expands on Transform for .NET by porting .NET Framework 3.5+ apps to cross-platform .NET 8/10, containerizing Windows workloads to ECS/Linux, converting SQL Server (including stored procedures and business logic) to Aurora PostgreSQL, and offering UI porting (ASP.NET MVC/Razor to ASP.NET Core or Web Forms to Blazor). Eliminating Windows and SQL licenses can drive ~70% runtime savings; Experian reported a 40% effort reduction across 687k lines of code and 300 engineering hours saved using these tools.
  
  Transform Custom allows agent-driven conversion of any code pattern (e.g., Java/Node runtime upgrades) using out-of-the-box or user-defined transformations, enabling broad technical-debt reduction with human-in-the-loop validation and regression testing. The Composability initiative lets partners and customers plug their own domain-specific agents into AWS workflows, creating differentiated offerings atop Transform. Transform for Mainframe analyzes IBM z/OS (COBOL) estates, generates technical and business-rule documentation, decomposes code, and refactors or reimagines workloads (often to Java) with built-in testing; Toyota uses it across 40 million lines of COBOL, modernizing 50% faster while developers query generated docs via Amazon Q Business.
  
  O’Brien closes by revisiting partner-enablement models born from earlier migration waves: AWS subsidizes partner services to deliver assessments, mobilization, and selective POCs; funds third-party tooling (e.g., mainframe refactoring partners); and encourages adoption of automation over brute-force staffing. Customers can engage incrementally—validating latency, open-source migrations, or cost cases—while partners embed Transform into delivery to boost win rates and margins. The net promise: modernization projects delivered at roughly half the cost and time, greater choice in landing zones (EC2, containers, PostgreSQL, Java/.NET), and a faster path to realizing cloud value.

Well good morning everybody, thank you for joining us. er it's good to see see you all here and my name's Nick O'Brien. I'm joined by Keith, Keith Groom. Um morning. er we've got uh a session, we've got um we're gonna be talking about how we can increase er workload modernization using a new wave of uh agentic technology. Uh, and it's gonna be me, so I'm setting it up, I'm gonna be talking for a little bit to begin with, and then I'm gonna pass over to Keith. Keith's gonna run through all of the, uh, new services that we've got and sort of like explain that and break that out for you. And then I'm gonna wrap up a little bit more for our partners specifically in the room and talk about how we help you and, and help in some cases fund that as well, so um. That's essentially the uh the content that we've got. Keith, do you wanna just introduce yourself? Yeah, hi folks. Uh, my name's Keith Grimm. I'm out of Seattle. I built AWS for 9 years, always working in the partner space, and I, I lead our worldwide strategy for migration, tooling and services. So think VMware and containerization. Helping partners really understand our services, help you embed them into your practice delivery, and help you win more migrations and modernization projects. So I'm excited to get into it in a few minutes. Thank you, Keith. So I was thinking about this session and And I was thinking about the theme of this week and what you will have also been attending over the last few days. And uh the one thing that struck me is like er there is more and more pressure as we're releasing brand new technology to sort of see how companies and customers can implement that in their own organizations. So there's this sort of like real desire. To act quickly at the moment and I know it's 10 o'clock in the morning, so I don't want to be getting overly philosophical with you, but it did strike me that it kind of touches a nerve about sometimes we're never happy. It's a kind of human condition that we always want more. We want things faster and As I was thinking about the theme of this session, it struck me, uh there was a quote that Jeff Bezos did, and I, it sort of resonated, and this guy kind of captures it for me, is that we as consumers are sometimes divinely discontent. And er what he, what he was referring to about that is he was recognizing like our human nature, and er and and like you know, a very clever man who's been very successful in his business career, you know, one of the things he's capable of doing is like reducing. His business into sort of what he referred to as three universal truths, and I think it really relates, and I felt it resonated with the discussion that we were having today. And those universal truths are, uh, we always want more choice, right? We always want more choice, we're never satisfied unless there's more things that we can decide and choose between, and we always want the price as low as possible. Our resources are finite, so we want to spend our resources carefully and we want to get as much as we can. And then when we make those decisions about what we want, the third thing is that we want it really quickly, we want it immediately, and I think about, you know, what, a moment I haven't bought anything on Amazon, the next minute I need it straight away. And, and really what uh Geoff was saying about this divinely discontent, this status that we are often as consumers. Is that you know there's that that we should be driving our business around those three things because they're never going to go away. And um I was thinking again about the theme of what we would be discussing today and uh and I was um I was looking at this research about CEOs and ultimately what they're trying to do as the custodians of businesses is drive their own organizations to value as fast as possible. Now whether that is they're worried about top line growth, they're looking about differentiation, they're looking about their operations and their business, bottom line profitability, they're accountable for all of that, accountable for. The Employment that they have for those organizations and therefore, invariably, innovation is a key way of staying on top of that. And so when polled, unsurprisingly, 84% of CEOs believe that innovation is critical. But then asked the second question, which is how pleased are you individually with your own performance, then unfortunately, many people don't come back with a rosy impression of how quickly they're moving in particular, and you can see that only 6%. In this instance, and and like we can't think of that in an abstract world, like these are people that run organizations that we often in the room if we're partners are serving. So we have to look at ourselves and think like what are we doing to help those people be satisfied satisfied about the pace of innovation that they have within their own business. And the question is like why are they so impatient and like the analysis that we see. There's a huge prize up for grabs for these companies, and so some research from McKinsey, find that you know across like you know the largest global organizations, trillions, trillions of value available for those companies that are able to adapt fast and sort of like capture the sort of changing landscape. In the organization, so I was thinking about that and I was connecting it with some of the things that we are introducing around transformation, modernization, migrations, and I was thinking. You know, like, like, how, how can I sort of convey to you, like, you know, what are we seeing so far in these sort of early days? And uh first and foremost, just from our own, you know, we're a large company, we have like thousands of applications. And uh and they need to also be maintained and modernized and and and migrated as well. And you know we've been using in our own business, our hygenic technology to sort of like speed up the way that we can do that. And you can see like just on the stats here, we've done that 10,000 times, so we're like using our own technology in our own business to sort of try and move the pace and improve uh the sort of services that we run. And then we notice when we're using like agentic technology to help us with that journey, we are saving a lot of time. You can see that when we quantify that, nearly 5000 developer years in time saving. And like all organizations, that helps us release capital that we can reinvest in our business. So we're doing that as well. So we're seeing and we're convinced about the impact that it's having for us, and we want to share that with with our customers and partners. We're also looking at this issue through the lens of some of our customers, and there is a phenomenal appetite now to go back and revisit some of those systems that they thought perhaps were too difficult to move, and we've seen a huge uptake in companies that are like looking at maybe. Some of their legacy mainframe environments and thinking about how they could modernize that and how agentic technology could help them on that process. And I pulled out one example, it's Thomson Reuters, like phenomenal attempt to drive down the technical debt in their business. 50 50%, sorry, um achieved already. You can see the stat there yourself and doing it 4 times faster than they'd previously been able to do it, and they're running at a real clip, 1.5 million lines of code every single month that they're transforming and then sort of like bringing back into their business in a modernized platform. So again, we're seeing it for ourselves, we're seeing it from our customer, and we're also seeing it from our partner and some of the stories that we're seeing where they. They're adopting this themselves. This is one of our partners, their Migration Partner of the Year in 2024, Calent. They've developed their own technology, uh, Accelerate, and um their customer in this instance, a company called NetSmart, they were also like applying this type of technology, and you can see the reduction in speed of the project. So I'm seeing again this recurring theme about being able to save money, do things faster, get to outcomes quicker, so. I was gonna, so, so I wanted to sort of say like, you know, we are really convinced about the impact it was gonna have and we wanted to share that with you. Keith's gonna come up and like now just talk a little bit about like how you can embed that and what we've got available. Keith? Yeah, I thought you had one more slide. I, I thought that was gonna be for you to. All right, perfect. Thanks, Nick, and um our clock isn't working to the folks in the back. I don't know if it's supposed to. We'll have to watch the clock here. There's a little clock they give us up front tells us how much time we have, but uh it's just started to work, so, um, nevertheless, um, thanks very much for being here this morning. Um, how many of you are, uh, consulting partners? Everyone a partner in this room? OK, how many of you an ISV partner? How many of you are customers? Oh, a lot of customers, wow, mostly customers in the audience. OK, so this was really a session focused on particularly consulting partners and how you're gonna transform your practice and your delivery. So now that there's a lot of customers in the room, I'll kinda make sure I talk, uh, both sides of the equation here, um. We have this new suite of products to help migrate and modernize workloads to AWS, right? I've been in AWS for 9 years. We've had lots of tools to migrate workloads over those years. We've never had the tools like we have today, the capabilities with Transform, so we're incredibly excited about the capabilities of Agentic AI to help customers more quickly move from on-prem. Into the cloud on AWS and or to modernize those workloads on AWS and for our partners in the audience this is never gonna be, uh, this is a transformational time in your delivery practice. Our objective with these services is to dramatically reduce the cost by a factor of 50% or more. How long it takes to deliver a project so that you can do more projects, you can deliver projects more reliably to customers, and so this is the thing that um Transform enables us to do. So we're at the very beginning stage here and there's about 4 products that I'm gonna, I'm gonna talk about today, uh, a tool for VMware migrations, tool for full stack Windows modernization. A tool for mainframe and I'll talk about another service we have for custom transformation. So it's um, so stay tuned we'll kind of dive in. This is more of an overview session. There are deep dive technical sessions throughout uh reinvent so I encourage you to attend some of those, but let's get into some of these. So we think about every migration, it really begins with 3 phases doing an assessment of your current state environment on premise or on AWS. And then what we call a mobilized phase where you're building out your landing zones, you're building out your operating model for the workloads and then actually migrating them and so I'm gonna talk about how these tools fit into each one of these stages and as a consulting partner this is where using these tools is gonna change your delivery practice and for the customers in the audience, this is our mental model of how we think about. Helping you if you're doing it yourself or if you're using a partner, we really break migrations into these three critical phases. So let me start with uh assessments. And the first tool, our current state is we have a native tool called migration evaluator. And how it works is as a customer you would engage AWS through our sales teams we would deploy an agent list tool to your environment, collect your inventory, and then we would produce an assessment outcome report as a result of that. You have to engage one of our sellers to get the tool deployed to work with our product team for that particular service. Now with Transform for assessments, it's right in the AWS console. So that's a totally different experience. We're going to simplify how you can access an assessment tool very quickly to deploy in your environment. So it simplifies your migration planning because every migration requires an assessment. It's really critical because it helps you make sure you're not missing things. It helps you remove the guesswork and helps you do better migration planning, and it's a lot more efficient. And what we've observed is when we do an assessment we right size those workloads from both a licensing perspective and from an infrastructure perspective, so optimizing, and that's what drives roughly 60% cost savings compared to on-prem when we have to optimize both sides of that equation. So how it works with Transform for assessments is you can either upload your existing inventory from like an RV tool export. Uh, from our MPA tool, our migration planning assistant tool, or other, you might have a CMB database you wanna upload or even an export from our current tool, migration evaluator. So what the tool will then do is it'll analyze it for X86 servers and storage and database and licensing and so it'll generate this cost and infrastructure set of recommendations and then you can view and download the business case report, then you can interact with the data through the chatbot feature and it can produce a report in about 15 minutes. It's very fast and so you can use this on an ongoing way if you have a very large enterprise migration that you need to assess multiple division, multiple workloads, uh, that sort of thing so it really becomes very democratized in the sense that you can quickly access it to the console immediately and it doesn't um. Um, Uh, you, you pay only for the, uh, the service is generally free, but it's only the output, I think you have, there's a. I don't know the pricing, so I'm gonna forget it, but it's generally free to use Transform for assessment. So this is an example of what the business case report will will spit out. So for our partners, what this is going to allow them to do, because today what you have to do is you have to submit an opportunity to AWS. We then have to connect you with our migration evaluator tool and then we have to deploy an agent list tool to the customer, pull the data, and then the partner to produce that assessment report. Now, it could all be done through the console in a really simplified experience. So this is gonna enable our partners in the room to really change the way in which they deliver assessments to customers. Um, now. To can't be candid, um. This tool we're migrating the functionality of migration evaluator into this tool Transform for assessment. So um as we get into January, it will, uh, we're increasing the functionality today. It works particularly well for um uh any X86 servers and databases. So I encourage you to go and try this out because it's generally available in the console today. So that's step one in that phase of a migration. So let's go on to the 2nd important tool, which is transform for VMware. So what this is, this is a migration tool to move from on-prem, so you're a a a VM in VMware environment on-premise. Now you want to move it into an EC2 instance. So the pathway is only into EC2 with this particular tool. It doesn't like automate into a container as an example, OK? Now, what this does is it helps you eliminate VMware licensing costs by moving into EC2 because you're now getting out of VMware software. And it obviously when it's an EC2, then you have full access to all AWS services. And what we really love about this tool is that it really simplifies a couple of really complex parts of a VMware migration. And the first is, it does discovery and data ingestion of what, what is your VMs look like within the VMware stack. It will then create an automated wave plan based on your VMware configuration on-prem, it'll create a wave plan recommendation set. Which is really hard to do. It's very complex. That's one of the most complex parts of migrating from out of VMware on-prem into AWS. Now once you've got the wave plan, it will also create your network conversion and topology. So one of the challenges is customers are on-prem, they've got hard coded IP addresses into the VMware environment. We will map that network configuration into AWS VPC constructs. That's also one of the most complex and time consuming parts of migrating from VMware and prem into an EC2. And then it will actually do the VM migration using under the covers our tool MGN as part of the Agentic AI tool. So those components are automated. You have human in the loop. You can do validation and testing. You can collaborate, and it really simplifies the planning. It takes a lot of the tedious task of actually deciding how to migrate and do the migration planning. So I'm very excited to test this out and have you to work through it. So I talked about. How it's already covered. So one example of this is our partner slalom helped Vector, who's an energy utility out of Australia. And they were able to do um a very large VMware migration uh with 100% accuracy in half the time of what they wanted to achieve. And so what this is able to help them do is dramatically reduce the time and effort for their engineers that were doing the migration to get into AWS natively and out of VMware software. So, um, so that, that's the, that's the migration tool, uh, really important use case today that we see, we see a lot of demand, uh, just in light of what's happening in the market around VMware and a lot of customers are wanting to understand how they get out of VMware. Now some of you might have heard of Transformer.net, which we released several months ago. What we've now done is added more capability to that launch of AWS Transform for .NET. We now have what we call transform for full stack modernization. And so what's we're what we're most excited about here is on Windows-based applications that by eliminating Windows Server license as part of that, you can get upwards of a 70% cost running cost on that application because it doesn't use Windows Server, it's running cross-platform.net. So I'm gonna talk about SQL Server and what we mean by all of these layers. So what what Transform does and where it's particularly exciting is on .NET framework 3.5 and higher. It will transform, report the code, and I'm gonna walk through the steps of how the tool works and where you're landing, you're landing on cross-platform.net 8 or 10. And this is really incredibly exciting because we have so many customers that have these legacy.NET framework applications that they really feel like it's impossible to modernize these things, so we have a whole new capability to accelerate modernization of these applications that that previously were really perceived as really hard to touch. We've also now have transformed for SQL Server. And and by the way, you know, imagine, you know, you've got, you know, think of an EC2 instance on AWS, you know, 60% of the cost of that instance is just in the Windows Server licensing. Now you're eliminating that. Huge benefit and you're also getting better flexibility and agility on the platform because you're at cross-platform.net you can run it on Linux servers you can run it on a Linux container, you can run it on ECS uh it opens up a lot of new options for you. On SQL Server, like this is where it gets really hard, you know, you have stored business logic and stored procedures and you're like, how do I unpack that? It seems really challenging. So now our agents are able to convert that to Aurora Postgraphs. Um, and again. You get better performance running Postress compared to SQL Server on AWS. But more importantly, you eliminate SQL Server license costs. Anybody know what the cost of SQL Enterprise is per core? It's like $4000 I think per, right? It's very expensive. So, um, imagine eliminating thousands of cores if you have that in your environment, um, so a huge opportunity there and then also virtual machines running on a Windows server we now can port them over into ECS or EC2 instances which is our elastic container service. So we call this full stack modernization. And essentially you deploy the .NET tool. It will do analysis of your code base, of your documentation, um, uh, of your, uh, code samples. It does reporting, finding updated libraries, does transformation of the code, human loop validation so that you can land on Linux, uh, either containerize or to run on Linux servers on .NET 8 cross-platform. And now. We've also got a Transform for .NET uh web UI porting, so we call this Apples to Apple porting. So if you're running NBC Razor ASP.NET, you can transform it to ASP.NET Core or we call it Apples to oranges porting. You can do web forms on ASP.NET to ASP Blazer on ASP.net core. So the SQL and the and the .NET web UI porting is new as part of this full stack Windows modernization, so. It gives you really an opportunity to sort of reimagine your Windows-based application environments that you have on-prem and really think differently about what can I do by modernizing them into AWS or if you're already running Windows applications on AWS, you can use these tools to modernize them to native services. So really exciting, um, tremendous, you know, agility getting your applications into a modern platform and significant cost savings by eliminating Windows Server and SQL Server licensing. So you know the thing about the SQL Server is is really important is you know we're going to take and the agents are going to abstract the business logic and the stored procedures and it's gonna understand the dependencies between the .NET applications. It'll surface those dependencies so that then it can transform those into um. Uh, uh, uh, on the Postgras side for the SQL server as well as on the application side ported over into .NET Core framework so the agent will manage that transformation for you with human in the loop to do all the testing for you. Experian did this project. They had, um, excuse me, excuse me, they, their, their data office had 7 legacy applications that they wanted to move to .NET 8. And they, they said that they had a 40% reduction in the effort for their developer teams to transform the 687,000 lines of code in this particular application and one of the things I love what they said is they saved 300 engineering hours using this. So like these these tools means you don't have to hire more developer engineers, but now you can think about making them more productive and taking on larger projects across your your organization so we're seeing tremendous results with um these modernization tooling so far so I really encourage you to um you know go test them, uh, work with your developer team, set up an environment. And and begin to test out and get your hands on with some of these tools and for our partners, we want you to be able to, you know, test these tools and build them into your delivery practices for customers. Now, so let's talk about another exciting announcement which is called Transform custom. So, so this is slightly different. So this really is focused on helping you transform any code pattern to reduce your technical debt. So think about doing Java, uh, runtime upgrades or think about no. JS upgrades, um, all of these. Other areas of your application stack you can use out of the box transformations that we've built or you can build custom transformation based on your unique data, your code base, and the applications that you have. So this is a new capability that we're making generally available today. Reinvent and it helps you scale across your enterprise to all these other types of smaller applications that you have to really upgrade all of this legacy technical that you have within your application stacks. So this can transform any code pattern. The the agents can learn and transform as you give it more data and documentation and code samples. It can then transform. Uh, enterprise wide, uh, with human in the loop, um, uh, design and testing built into it, so I encourage you to take a look at AWS Transform. I know we have a lot of weird names like, you know, we, um, uh, so the, the point I wanna make here too is that today these are all discrete services, right? You would use the assessment service, the VMware service, you know, we anticipate over time it'll be a suite of products and you can. But today I just want to be candid that that they are individual services that you'll use and deploy in your environment but but again, you know, imagine. You know, modernizing .NET app 80% faster. Like this is gonna be game changing with within enterprise. um, it's gonna help you really reduce technical debt, help you accelerate innovation, and really get your application stacked to a modern platform. Now another one we'll talk about in the transform family is what we call the composability initiative. And what this is designed to do is to allow partners to might have domain specific knowledge in an industry in a use case they then can take their agents and integrate them into the AWS tooling to do custom workflows for application modernization. It's gonna allow our partners to. Really develop unique and tailored and differentiated offerings that they can use with customers across industries across lots of different types of use cases. And it allows them to really apply their own expertise uh in an area for uh application transformation. So this idea is you would have your own agents and then you'd be integrating them into our tooling through the Composability initiative. Um, so this is now generally available and so many of our partners have already built some of their own tooling and agents or they might have some legacy tooling and agents. That that that they wanna apply to a particular use case they're not gonna be able to do that and so and customers if you've built something yourself through your developer teams you then can now embed them or integrate them with the AWS Transform suite of services. So very exciting to to see that one and the final one I'll talk about is is mainframe. Um, this has really been, uh, quite interesting, um, you know. It's amazing to me how much mainframe is still out there. Like those guys that wrote that stuff, hats off to them. I mean, it's 40, 50, 60 years later that stuff is still running, but you know, the, the, the pool of people who know Cobalt and know those applications is dramatically shrinking. And so there's never been more urgency to have a tool that can help you analyze mainframe applications so that you can modernize them to cloud native. And so transform for mainframe is really reducing the time dramatically it takes to modernize mainframes. And so you know how it works is the tool will analyze your IBMZ slash OS applications, typically cobalt, do this code analysis, then it generates this documentation, generates the technical and the business rule documentation. So that your developers can build a modernization path typically in Java. So then it decodes does code decomposition so that we can we can break down that mainframe code into modules so that we can. Um, leverage the agents to modernize it to Java and then you can plan your migration sequence of the business logic, the, uh, uh, the business rules, it's context aware of the application so you can either refactor the code or reimagine the code and it has a built in testing modules. So this has been transformative for a lot of our mainframe customers. That and and the documentation piece is really critical because like they don't have anybody that knows there's no documentation anywhere so it has this ability to really generate this deep technical documentation so that you can build a plan and using the agents to modernize the application. Now Toyota is using this um today uh they have 40 million lines of cobalt code, uh, and they're using this tool to work through the thousands of these legacy programs in their mainframe and, and they, they need to get these into Java into modern architectures so they leverage transform to do analyze tasks and agents and really identifying missing parts of the application so that they, they, they, they couldn't figure out. You know, different components of those mainframe applications to, to modernize and the agents really and the documentation assisted with that and they also use the Amazon Que for Business chat systems so they could query so the developers could query the documentation, ask it questions, um, and they're able to modernize 50% faster and it's really been revolutionary. Uh, you can see the, the quote from the Brian, the CTO of, of Toyota, um, so this is ongoing. Um, uh, process, but you know this is now a pathway to get out of your mainframes and you know think about the technical adapt from your mainframes whether that's both from, you know, and you got a lot of risk and you know these are typically mission critical applications running on these mainframes and you know you don't wanna mess those up as you modernize them and so this is a new solution for you to help you with that. Uh, help you shut down this expensive hardware and support contracts that run on mainframes and, and move those applications to Cloud Native on AWS. So with that, I'm going to turn it back over to Nick and he's going to wrap up the next couple of slides. Yeah, thank you, Keith. Am I back on Jason? Can you hear me OK? Oh thank thank you, thank you, thank you. OK, so I'm, I'm really pleased Keith asking the question about the blend of the audience and it is nice to see such a combination of customers and partners, but it probably means I should take a step back here just to explain uh what what this slide's all about. So. Maybe if I do a little bit of a sort of like a history lesson, a little bit to contextualize it. If we go back to the period of like say 2015, 2016, that sort of period of time, that's when we saw for the first time some really large corporate organizations starting to move what we called mass migrations at the time. Really large volumes of servers onto AWS, uh, Capital One type stories, General Electric, some really big organizations. And uh and and and and that was going, there was a good trajectory to that, we're delighted. Uh, but in about, uh, after lots of conversations with customers, uh, the recurring message came back from our customers, which was, hey, we, we like the idea of moving to the cloud, but we're trying to run a business. These aren't cheap projects, you know, it's going to take a lot of time. We don't necessarily have the people with the skills and understanding. To perform these activities and you know so whilst we're interested in doing it, we're a little bit reticent and we can't get the commercials to work, we can't get the ROI in the time that we need. So fast forward into 2020, the company made a decision to change the way in which we would approach that specific issue. And what we felt is that if we could eliminate some of the cost concerns that customers were facing. Then they would move a lot faster. So the discussion was moving away from a cost, uh, economics into more of a like a change in a change management and that what sort of rate that they could absorb within their businesses. So that that paved the way for what I describe as exponential growth in terms of the volumes that we were doing. We've taken away the issues about cost and we were able to sort of focus on the change itself. And what that did is it spawned a number of things that our partners would use to help the customers have those conversations. about how we would support financially, where essentially what we would do, we would offset their professional services costs, so then the customer could then elect, it could choose whichever customer whichever partner they felt would be most suitable and then they could actually get them to undertake certain activities. And there was no commitment, there was no, you, you literally, you could leave us the following day, or you could just do the assess and then say this is not for us. So we tried to make it quite blocky, so you could just do these small activities and sort of like build more confidence about. About how you wanted to progress with us. So uh Keith talked about this earlier, this is sort of like the sort of simple methodology that we use assesses. We're really just about trying to uh envision uh what uh environment that you had. Obviously that can be fundamentally changed by some of the technology that Keith's been talking about. And we introduced a few of these programs, uh they they've got names but essentially what they're doing is they're saying. To our partners, we'll fund you to go and do that activity for a customer, give them, so they can have an outcome that can help them make informed decision making. And we found that site being really useful for our customers. I would say whilst there's many customers that want to do some of these things themselves, totally understand that, they've got the skills and they've got the people that can do it. Other, other customers were thinking, hey, this is a transitory set of skills that I only need to get us onto the platform. I don't really want to invest and divest. My team into like learning this stuff, so we'll just get somebody in, perform that task, and then we'll run, run the environments afterwards. So these programs here are all fundamentally there to sort of help our partners have that conversation with customers and help customers sort of like move with confidence and knowing that, you know, financially, you know, it won't be quite as big an impact. So you can see one Ola, which is something that like Keith has championed. Uh, which is very much about like quick decision making, have a real quick feel for what's going on. So if you're interested, you could use an Ola, and it's very much, uh, workload oriented, so it's bringing like the specialization of what, what's needed in that particular, whether it's a VMware, an Oracle, Microsoft, etc. etc. So often like very pointed. For our larger program of work we'd use MA, again that covers like funding across all of these uh these phases. And then there's other things that customers also need, right, sometimes they actually, they've like, they they're not convinced that it will be able to run, they can't get the um the speed of latency, for instance, or or the complexity, so, so they wanna actually see some uh POC proof of concepts. So sometimes we bundle that into the journey as well if that's if that's what the customer needs. And, and Keith also talked about like sometimes like you spend an awful lot of money on some of this proprietary software licensing and uh there's ways in which we want to encourage you to think about a way in which you can move into an open source alternative. So we have like um you know programs involved where if that's something of interest to you and we've got partners skilled in those particular areas, they're building up like their tool uh systems as well, uh then they can capitalize on that. So, and, and, and the final thing, which is essentially what this slide sort of like finishes. With is that um we we didn't want to be in a situation where it was just people turning up. I mean we we we love our partners and we love the fact that there's like really skilled people there, but you know we're moving away from a labor driven approach, as you know as as you know this week has been the main theme. And, and what we wanna do is really encourage like the adoption of technology and then have like skilled people operating that technology. And we thought, well, what we should do is we should pay for that separately. So Keith again has built out like a portfolio of fantastic partners that have got really useful skills in areas that are above and beyond what we have as our own technology set. And we would fund that ourselves. So we'd just be able to say to you as a customer, right, I'd like to use uh Matilda, I'd like to use cars for my mainframe, and then we'd say, OK, we'll take care of the. Costs of that and then you can still on top of that highlight use some of these uh professional services options as well. So the idea is that we'd encourage uh both adoption of like skilled people and and technology as well. So that's really what this slide is doing, it's just trying to tell our partners and our customers that this is something that we're willing to support. We've done it, um, you know, with phenomenal success actually. And um and I think it's really sort of like helped customers like make that make that move uh onto AWS so. The next slide that I do have, which is just to wrap up, which is for the partners in the room, uh, which is just some resources that we've got. So we've got some more information about unpacking some of these resources. I did see some people taking photos. If you're interested and you want some of the content, just um, you can look me up on uh LinkedIn and I can just like send you the deck if you're interested. Uh, but there are also some other resources here that we've like made available, so again, you know, there's QR code that you can access there. So that is us, that was Keith and myself, Nick O'Brien. Uh, thank you so much for your time. Appreciate it, it um, and if like, if you've got any questions, I'll, I'll just loiter out the side and we can sort of talk about that as well. Thanks for joining the session and check out other Transform sessions. Appreciate it.
