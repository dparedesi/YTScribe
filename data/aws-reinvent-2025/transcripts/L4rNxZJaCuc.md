Good morning. Uh, welcome to day 3 of Reinvent 2025. Hopefully everybody's having a great reinvent so far. Uh, my name's Colin McCarthy. I'm a vice president and distinguished engineer at AidWest. I've been at Aid West about 18 years. And uh for the last few years it's been my job to lead the design, build, and delivery of the ABS European sovereign Cloud, which we're gonna talk to you about today. It's kind of a unique project for me. I've never worked on a project that's involved so many different aspects of my background. Uh, as you might be able to tell from my accent, I'm proud to be an EU citizen. Uh, I was born and grew up, and lived in Ireland for a long time. At a time when the European Union made enormous difference to the modernization and development of Ireland, I also moved to the US to work for AWS, and I'm also proud that I became a naturalized US citizen, so I've got a foot on both sides of the Atlantic. And my technical background, my career actually started in public service. I worked at a publicly owned agency in Ireland, serving government departments, serving citizens and end users inside other government agencies and so on. And I've, uh, I've lived across Europe, spent a long time living in the Netherlands. I've worked on pan-European projects like Gon and CERN, um, and as a developer, uh, my focus has always been on privacy. When I write code, I'm writing our encryption software and virtualization software, which are both key technologies that allow us to work with data in ways where we can't see the data. And I've never had a project that's involved all of these different aspects until working on this. So for me it's, it's, it's been fun. Um, with me today is also gonna be speaking is my colleague Addi. Hi, thanks, Cole. Hi everyone. My name is Addie, and unlike Cole, I'm not an EU citizen, but I have been there plenty of times to, you know, for the border control to recognize me by my name and also have figured out my favorite bakeries in the EU. Um, I'm a. Uh, principal product manager on the EC2 team, um, currently working on digital sovereignty and the AWS European sovereign cloud. Uh, please excuse me for my voice. It's a little hoarse. Um, I don't know what's going on with the air in, uh, Vegas, but, um, hopefully we'll have a great session today. Take it away. Thanks, Eddie. Yeah, so today we're gonna dig into, um, why sovereignty matters and how we think about sovereignty at AWS, not just in the context of European sovereign cloud, but in the context of all of our existing commercial regions too. We'll dig into our sovereign by design patterns, and then we're gonna talk about the differences with the European sovereign cloud, why we've built it, what's different, help you decide whether you should use it or not, and hopefully we're going to leave you with some key takeaways that will let you make that decision and then what to do as next steps if you're gonna use and run on the AIWS European sovereign cloud. So let's start. So, in my opinion, sovereign nations and international unions like the European Union are no understatement of humanity's greatest accomplishment. I mean, they literally lessen wars, conflict, and famine. It's hard to do better than that, you know, in the development of all human society, they're a pinnacle of, of human achievement. But. Anything that can get, you know, tens or hundreds of millions of people united behind one flag to any degree of common identity and common purpose is just amazing. And even though those nations and international unions foster collaboration between countries, they still are matters that have to be protected to safeguard that sovereignty. There are still rivalries and even enmities between countries and unions and so on. And so for a certain class of workloads, certain class of sovereign customers, we face enhanced requirements that dig into security, autonomy, and continuity in particular, and how do we safeguard those so that we can reassure our sovereign customers that no matter what's going to happen, the workloads that they need to serve in that way are always going to be protected. And at a high level, our philosophy for our sovereign customers, and the way we want to serve those customers, is that they should have all the control they need, but without any compromises. You know, too often these customers are left stranded on relatively small deployments, on-prem legacy infrastructure, or small or small scale systems that have subsets of services and features that force these customers to make trade-offs. They often do that because they need really tight control around the systems, but ironically, it can actually backfire and lead to kind of eroding sovereignty. You know, the most realistic day to day risks that these customers face are just ordinary security risks, uh, breaches, phishing attacks, malware and ransom attacks. We can all think of headlines and examples where government agencies, government examples, health departments, health services, police departments even, have been taken out for days or weeks at a time because of those kinds of issues. And sometimes those issues are even triggered by foreign actors. Often behind these attacks and breaches are criminal gangs who are sometimes state sponsored, state sanctioned, or at least state tolerated by foreign states. So despite all of this work to protect sovereignty, citizens' data still ends up in the hands of adversaries. And because we've seen that, we wanted to be able to offer these customers our full offerings. We want them to be able to use all of our services at our full hyper scale without any of those compromises. We want them to have access to our fine-grained security policies, our always on security monitoring, our integrated backup and restore, and all of those things that make those day to day risks go away. But then still have all of the control that those customers need, so they can be reassured about all of the other aspects of sovereignty. And so when I say the full power of AWS, it can be hard to kind of get across and convey what that means. You know, many of our sovereign customers are used to relatively small scale systems like a few servers or a few racks in a closet in an office building, even is not that uncommon, or maybe a cage in a cola facility that has a few racks too. But at AOS our scale is vastly different, you know, the data centers and availability zones that we build are the size of IKEA stores, just full of servers. And when we're building services, they have unparalleled scale. Think of a system like S3, just massive storage capacity, or a system like EC2, just incredible compute flexibility and agility. And there aren't that many analogies I can use for this. But one I do like to use is think of a modern research hospital. This is, uh, the Leiden University Medical Center. I used to live in Leiden, so as far as I'm concerned, this is Europe's premier hospital. Uh, they, they certainly believe so. And. If you were to drill in on any one department in that hospital, you'd see it's a marvel. Like you'd see they have a world-class cardiology facility or a world-class medical school. Each of those on their own, takes an enormous breadth of experience and expertise, and also takes constantly running logistics. Think of the pharma pharmacological and blood products that constantly have to be supplied. Think of all the cleaning that just has to happen to keep everything sterile, just always happening. Each one of those departments is a world-class facility on its own. But then even more powerful is that they're all brought together in one place. That means the hospital can be a tier one trauma center. So if someone's in a critical accident, and have injuries to different parts of their bodies, they can be all treated in that one place. Or if they have a complex disease. The same thing, and that's the kind of power we want for our customers. We don't want them to have to make trade-offs because of scale or subsets of features. We want all of our marvels like S3 and EC2 to be there so that customers can build workloads as complex as Amazon.com or as leading edge as their own foundational or fine-tuned, uh, machine learning models. We want to be able to deliver all of that with no compromises directly, even to our sovereign customers. And actually today, we deliver most of, uh, uh, most of our public sector business, most of our sovereign customers, we actually do this in our normal commercial regions, and that's still going to be the best place for many of those customers. We're actually able to give them. Uh, the controls they need for most workloads there. What's becoming even more important for these customers is that Sovereign and government customers almost universally have their own national or international regulations, uh, and compliance laws and so on to comply with. And we've gotten clear feedback from customers and regulators over time that this needs to be easier and easier. You know, when I talk to regulators across Europe, they pretty much all are understaffed, they pretty much all have backlogs of, of workloads that need to be certified and so on. So anything that we can do to help simplify that story is a huge accelerator for customers and can speed up adoption. So that's something else we tend to have to do a little differently for sovereign customers. And our design philosophy here from day one at AWS has to make our systems sovereign by design. So what does that mean? So we built AWS 20 years ago, and our first region was in Northern Virginia in the US. And when we were building our second region, which launched in 2008, which was actually in Ireland, uh, in our first region in Europe, we faced an important decision to make. You know, would we just make it a seamless extension of our existing infrastructure, or would we show the seams? Would we actually treat it as quite different infrastructure? And, and so in the seamless model, you can imagine a customer could store data in Northern Virginia and then access it directly in Ireland. And there's some advantages to that, you know, that gives you flexibility. You're able to move workloads between those regions, uh, more easily and so on. Many of our competitors chose this engineering design, you know, many other clouds do work like this, where if you put data in one place, it's able to migrate and move to the others, or the same for compute and so on. But we chose a different path, based on feedback from our customers. We heard that data residency and jurisdictional boundaries were incredibly critical. So when a customer puts data in a particular AWS region, it stays there, and we don't move it. The customer moves that data if they want to copy it to a different location. So it's always clear what jurisdiction it's in. Uh, and, and so on. As we designed our technical systems, we also paid key attention to our exposure to customer data, you know, we love hosting customer data, we love serving our customer workloads, but we don't wanna see that customer data, and we don't wanna see inside their workloads. It's not our business. We want to focus on our business. And so we're allergic to that data. We actually call it radioactive. We don't want to touch it, we don't wanna see it, and we want shields between us and it. So in our core architectures, like the AOS Nitro System for EC2 or KMS, which is protecting the keys that encrypt all your data, and the encryption itself, we've built them in such a way where the customer can use our services and enjoy the experience of AOS, but we have no technical means to access their data. It's really, really, really important. Um, and it's not just that we don't move data. The seams and the walls between our regions go even higher. We actually operate every AWS region almost entirely independently. And what I mean by that is if you were to drill in and say, look at the EC2 service that's running in Northern Virginia, well, we've actually got a separate copy of the EC2 instance that's running autonomously in each region in Europe or each region elsewhere around the world. That's important not just for digital sovereignty. But also for availability and redundancy and resilience. If we have a problem in one region, we don't want it to cascade or have knock-on impacts in other regions. We want customers to be able to get all of the benefits of using multiple regions. We're, we've got more regions than ever, and we're always building more. We've got almost 40 regions publicly, commercially available today, and always have more on the way. And all of these regions come with these sovereign by design controls. And as I said, most of our public sector workloads, most of our sovereign workloads, just run in these regions today, and all of those controls, uh, and compliance processes that we have, uh, are able to accommodate them in existing regions. But sometimes we face needs that go far beyond this, where it's not just the customer needs to be reassured that we can't see the data. But need to be reassured about other things like who's operating it, what are the legal governances, and so on. So we're gonna talk more about that. And this is not the first time we've faced these issues or done something like this. In the US we've long had US GovCloud, which we build for US government customers, which is operated exclusively by US citizens. But we also have some dedicated sovereign, other dedicated sovereign clouds. We have a cloud in China. Uh, that's dedicated for our Chinese customers and Chinese business and is operated very separately. So we have a good track record. We know how to take full hyper-scale infrastructure and build it in a way where we can achieve the highest levels of sovereignty separations, and get into not just the data sovereignty that our customers need, but that operational sovereignty and all of their government's controls. And that's what we're doing with the European sovereign Cloud. The really short version, is we're building a completely dedicated, physically and logically separated cloud infrastructure just for Europe, run exclusively by EU operators in the EU with no external dependencies on non-EU infrastructure or personnel. Um, now, because each region is already isolated, as I've shown you, well, what are the technical differences? Where does it start? So let's drill in on those. So, we do have a handful of services that we call global services that actually operate either in front of our regions or are centralized in some way in one particular place. And the first example here is billing and usage. You know, many of our customers might use 2 or 40 regions, but they only want to get one bill. So we aggregate all of the billing and usage data, we centralize that in one place, and we generate one bill every once a month, and that's, that's how our customers get their bills. Our identity and access management, some components of that are global. So the actual authentication and security that you have, that's happening, that's actually happening in each region. And we're doing it in, in some really smart, clever ways where the credentials that are used are actually specific to each region, so we still get all of that nice regional separation. But for consistency, we do allow customers to define their users, accounts, policies, permissions, organizations once. So those can be defined in one consistent place and reused across all of the regions. And then. Services like Amazon Route 53 are DNS service. So DNS is an intrinsically global system. The world only has one DNS, and also DNS is often used to serve customers from different regions. A customer might use DNS to say, you know, I want my European users to be sent to this European region. I want my US customers to be sent to this US region. So it kind of has to sit in front of regions and outside of that concept of a region. Those are global services and you'll see in a bit how we're building versions of those dedicated to and specific for the European sovereign cloud. Inside our regions, you'll see. Our, uh, services like EC2 and S3 that I mentioned are regional, so we're running full autonomous copies of those services. When EC2, when I'm calling EC2 in Ireland, my request never leaves Ireland or uh in Paris, it never leaves Paris from the or in Frankfurt, it never leaves Frankfurt and so on, uh, and that's true for almost all of our services. That's our default design pattern, very, very, very strong default. Um, I'm actually telling a little bit of a white lie here because if you were to drill in even further, you'd see that those services are actually zonal under the hood, so our regions are made up of availability zones of different data centers. Those availabilities are spread across an area about the size of a city, and actually services like EC2 and S3 and so on, they have redundant resilient infrastructure in each of those availability zones so that we can maintain and offer our customers very, very high availability. And so the very short technical version of all this, is that for the European sovereign Cloud, it's like we're putting a bubble around everything, not just our regional services, but even the global ones too. And we're building full dedicated, um, isolated copies of those with dedicated EU staff to serve them. Uh, we'll get into more detail in a bit, but for the next section, I'm gonna hand over to Addie, who's gonna introduce you to the AWS European sovereign Cloud. All right, let's dive deep into the AWS European sovereign Cloud. Uh, we pre-announced our plans to build the AWSR European Sovereign Cloud back in October of 2023 based on decades of AWS experience in running and operating and building, uh, multiple independent clouds for the most critical and restricted workloads. The AWS European Sovereign Cloud is going to be located in the state of Brandenburg and is established under a parent German company. Um, it is a net new partition, which is physically separate and independent from the rest of our regions at AWS. Um, it features its own identity and access management and billing stack. Um, so let me kind of break that down, what that means. How many of you use more than one AWS region today? Right, great, um, and when you do that, you realize you get one bill which consolidates all of your spend across these regions. You also end up using one account to access all these regions. So with AWS European Sovereign Cloud, that's gonna change, which means you will have to create net new accounts in order to access the services that we provide for the AWS European Sovereign Cloud, and you will get a separate bill for this region. In addition to these aspects, um, the AWS European Sovereign Cloud also provides enhanced data residency. So, uh, let's kind of go into that, right? Um, with AWS, you've customers have always been in control of their data. They decide where the data gets stored and who has access to it, right? With the European sovereign cloud, we've gone one step beyond in providing enhanced data residency, which means that not just customer content but also customer created metadata will stay within the EU. So what does customer? metadata mean, um, customer created metadata is defined as the metadata that customers create to manage their resources in the cloud. So I'm talking about resource labels, tags, configurations, etc. All of that is going to stay within the EU. And having said that, right, um, apart from independent infrastructure, the AWS European sovereign Cloud will also provide operational autonomy, which means zero operational control from outside of the EU. All of the operations of the European AWS European sovereign cloud will be done by EU citizens, AWS who are AWS employees and are located in the EU. And this covers right from the infrastructure layer where you have data center operations to service operations to day to day operations and also customer support. Um, we are right now transitioning to ensure that the European sovereign cloud is exclusively operated by EU citizens. So during this transition period, we will work with the workforce of a blended model with EU residents as well as EU citizens until a period of time. Um, some other key characteristics of the AWSC European sovereign Cloud. The first one speaks to the independent governance structure, which means that for the AWS European Sovereign Cloud, we have established net new entities as well as have established independent governance, and I'm gonna go over that in a few minutes. The second one is around indefinite operations. Um, so, you know, when we've been working backwards with customers, one of the key themes that emerged around survivability, um, and the use case that, you know, kept coming up was around, hey, I wanna make sure that I wanna be able to sustain my operations despite a geopolitical crisis or, you know, a technical failure or even a natural disaster. And in order to address that, right, AWS has been committed to ensuring continuous operations and to that end, what we've done with the AWS European Sovereign Cloud is one, ensured that there are no critical dependencies for on the infrastructure side from outside of the EU. That's one. And then 2, we are committed to ensuring that customers and, you know, we are able to deliver continuous operations even in the most extreme circumstances. To deliver to that, the third thing that I want to talk about is we've made sure that a copy of the source code for the services that are required to run the AWCR European Sovereign Cloud are also sitting within the boundary of the AWSCR European Sovereign Cloud, or the bubble as Co called it earlier. We're also introducing the sovereign reference framework with the AWSC European sovereign Cloud. This basically helps translate the sovereignty requirements into auditable controls, and these sovereignty requirements are a function of what we've learned from our customers, regulators, and they're guided by the, you know, industry leading frameworks, and they help identify or help. Uh, communicate to customers and partners a single source of, you know, or a consistent way to really understand how the sovereignty requirements map into auditable controls as well as how they can be independent, how they're designed, implemented, and also independently audited. It is basically a framework of your, uh, legal, operational, and technical controls all coming together. Um, we're also gonna be establishing a dedicated security operations center which Com is gonna talk about in a few minutes and then, uh, for the first time we're also introducing a dedicated European service trust provider for the European sovereign cloud. Um, and what that means is that this dedicated European trust service provider is going to be in control of issuing key certificate materials and certificates within the EU. So in the event of a disconnect, etc. um, you know, this, this particular entity can autonomously still continue to issue certificates within the EU. So net net, right? I think, I think one of the key takeaways from here is that everything that you need to operate the AWSC European sovereign cloud is in the EU, right from the talent, the technology, the infrastructure, and the leadership. And coming to leadership, let me walk you through with what does the governance structure of European Sovereign Cloud look like. So we said we've established a parent German company, AWS European Sovereign Cloud GMBH. This is going to, uh, it's gonna have its own managing director, uh, which is Stefan Israel, who joined us pretty recently, and we'll also have a security officer as the manager of this parent company. Both of them, and both of these roles will be EU citizens located in the EU. We're also establishing an advisory board with the AWSCRP and Sovereign Cloud, and, um, the the advisory board is expected or is, is entitled to act in the best interest of the AWSCRP and sovereign cloud. Um, the composition of the advisory board is going to include, um, 4 members, um, of which 3 of them are, uh, you know, Amazon employees, um, and then we're also gonna have 1 independent member who's not on an Amazon employee. The purpose of the advisory board is to ensure that, uh, you know, there is, um, the sovereignty expectations that we've set with the AWCRP European sovereign cloud are held, and number 2, ensuring that there's accountability for all of the controls, sovereignty controls that we are bringing in with the AWSCRP and sovereign cloud. Um, I, I also mentioned that, uh, you know, European sovereign Cloud, AWS European sovereign Cloud will also have its own, uh, sub-entities. The first one will be the infrastructure one, and then there's a research and development, and the third one is the trust certificate subsidiary which, as I heard before, will be responsible for issuing the trust certificates in the EU for AWSCRP stuff cloud. Um, so with AWS European sovereign cloud, you're going to get an end to end Euro pricing experience, and what that means is that all of the, all of the services that you see that are going to be offered as part of the European sovereign cloud will be priced in euros, including our other pricing models such as savings plans. And on, etc. and also the support plans, right, um, the pricing calculator is also gonna display all of your quotations, etc. in, in euros itself. Um, customers will have the choice to pay in any of their preferred currencies of the 18 that we support today. So that, that should still be happening. Um, it's still built on all the same principles, uh, pricing principles of AWS you pay as you go, and, uh, you know, um, etc. Um, ESC is, um, is, you know, the first globally available region, um, where we're offering a non-USD denomination apart from China, but this is the one where we're delivering end to end, um, pricing experience completely in euros. And now I'm gonna hand it over to Ccomm to walk you through some of the technical aspects of the European sovereign cloud. Thanks. Well, just repeat that. So we have an enormous list of backup of backend systems that were operating autonomously inside the European sovereign cloud. Think of the badge and access systems that people use to get into buildings. Think of email, uh, you know, all sorts of backend and corporate systems like that that we've had to localize for the European sovereign cloud. But I here on double click into some of the services we're building in the European sovereign Cloud that customers get to see and interact with. So Annie mentioned our trust services provider where for the first time, and I think it's a world first, we're gonna be operating a dedicated European root certificate authority. So our operators have gone through. Everything it does, the everything it takes to operate a root certificate authority in Europe. We've done, we've built the secure physical infrastructure, we've done the key signing ceremonies, we've done all of the training and certification processes, and so on. So when you run a low bouncer or a cloud front distribution, or if you need an SSL certificate for your own EC2 instance, that comes directly from our trust do provider in the ESC, and that can continue day to day. We also have a dedicated DNS service inside the ESE. And so our app we're building a dedicated version of our Amazon Route 53 service directly inside it. Um, if you create a domain today on Amazon Route 53, you might notice that we host it on 4 name servers, and if you look closely, those 4 name servers are hosted on different top level domains. One ends in .com, one ends in .net, one ends in .org, and one ends in .co.uk. That's actually for our own resilience and redundancy. If any of those top level domains have a bad day, we don't want our customers to be impacted. But none of those domains are hosted in the EU. So in our version in the European Union, in the European sovereign cloud, we're actually using European domains. So those name servers are hosted on .U.D.for, and so on. That's how deep, um, we have to go to ensure we really do meet that commitment. There are no technical or operational dependencies outside of the EU. The European Sovereign Cloud also has its own dedicated network and backbone. The links that connect our data centers and availability zones are all managed inside of the European Sovereign Cloud. We also have dedicated direct connect locations that are going to be part of the European Sovereign Cloud. It also has its own dedicated internet connectivity. Now here we're doing a best of both worlds. We are connecting the European sovereign cloud to the global AWS backbone, so we'll have that fast, low latency, high reliability, always encrypted connectivity to all of our other regions, and on a day to day basis, that's what it will use. But we also have dedicated backup. Connectivity, separate transit connectivity from European providers so that if the AidWest backbone were unreachable or went away for any reason, the European sovereign Cloud could still operate fully autonomously. And then we've got a dedicated security operations center inside the European Sovereign Cloud. We've got security staff and a dedicated security leader who have full supervision and access to all of the security monitoring that we run inside our regions and everything it takes to run proactive response to any risks and threats that emerge. All of this. More is what helps us achieve compliance obligations. We, we want it to be easy and rapid for customers to be able to certify their workloads to run inside the European sovereign cloud. One of the reasons why customer-created metadata stays inside the European sovereign cloud is so that customers no longer need even those trivial administrative data exceptions that they sometimes require. Uh, stuff like that is just dramatically simplified in the European sovereign cloud. And for the first time, and based on consultation and working with regulators across Europe, we're also documenting all of our sovereignty controls rigorously, and we've got an exhaustive list of everything we've done, how the control works, why it was done that way. The evidence-based processes that we use with regulators to show that that compliance control works. This is designed to accelerate compliance. As I said, feedback from regulators across Europe has told us that they just greatly appreciate any kind of acceleration that we can do there. Uh, it makes a big difference for how quickly our customers can adapt. With that, I'll hand you back to Addie, and then I'll be back for to end. Thank you. AWS has always been committed to Europe and its digital goals and its ambition, and we've always been making sure that we are investing heavily in the EU. The AWS European sovereign Cloud represents the continued AWS investment in Europe. Um, in fact, EU has the single largest group of our engineering teams for AWS outside of the US in our development centers in Dresden, Dublin, as well as Berlin, um, and you'll also be, um, you'll also be surprised to hear, uh, that some of our core services like the AWS Nitro and Cloud Watch are actually built from the other side of the pond. So that's pretty interesting, um. Um, AWS European sovereign cloud is, uh, is, is an investment of $7.8 billion and this has all been making, we're making sure that we're committed to, uh, contributing to the social economic fabric of the EU by investing heavily, um, ensuring that we're building skills and the talent and the technology for, uh, you know, EU to really compete at that global level and global scale. Moving on to partners, uh, partners and AWS have always been a winning combination, right? They provide immense amount of value delivery because they're the closest to our customers in understanding their workloads and their use cases. I'm happy to, um, let you guys know that we will have on the AWSCR. In sovereign cloud, a bunch of partner offerings, um, as we, uh, get ready to get out the door, um, and the idea here is to ensure that with the help of these partner offerings that are gonna be offered on the AWCRP and sovereign cloud, customers can actually leverage the depth and the breadth that the AWS sovereign cloud brings with itself. So who is this AWS European sovereign cloud exactly for, right? Um, um, the AWS European sovereign cloud is targeted for, uh, customers in the public sector, as well as the regulated industries. And when I say that, what I actually mean is that, um, you know, this, this, the AWC European sovereign cloud is for customers and for workloads that are not yet on the clo cloud, and because of Any sovereignty concerns or reasons. So the idea here, and this is a good segue into one of our best practices, which is I think it is important to establish and understand what is your use case and what type of workloads that you're thinking that you want to bring on to the AWSCRP and sovereign cloud. It's not like you want to migrate everything from our. Existing regions onto the AWR and sovereign cloud because they still offer the same compliance and standards that are industry leading, right? So the idea here is to really think and be thoughtful about the kind of workloads, the additional sovereign controls that warrant these workloads to actually move to the cloud only on the basis of what is needed or what is required of them. The second best practice is, you know, um, the need to qualify instances, right? So, um, you know, it's the same APIs, the same AWS goodness that we're offering with the AWS European sovereign Cloud. But as you know, we are always continuously, rapidly, actually, uh, improving our hardware, right? So all the instance types that we launch and we try and launch with new instance types in our regions. So the idea here is that we highly recommend that if you do wanna play around or get into the AWCRP and sovereign Cloud, you do your thorough testing and make sure that you're qualifying the instances. The third best practice is around the reserving capacity for business continuity. So what we, what we don't want to, would like to happen is that you think of the AWC European sovereign cloud at the last minute just because, you know, there is a, a, you know, a, a concern around, uh, you know, continuous operations, etc. What we would like to recommend is that you think. About this in advance, right, as you're thinking at 360 about your workloads and your use cases as to when is a good time to reserve capacity and ensure that you are thinking ahead of, you know, a scenario which could be of concern to you or your customer. Having said that, I'm gonna now hand this over back to Cole because I'm sure you guys have a lot of top of mind questions and hard questions that come with the AWCR and Sovereign Cloud. Thank you, Cole. Thanks, Addie. Um. So across Europe I've been talking to a lot of customers, a lot of partners, a lot of systems integrators, a lot of end users, and, and there's some questions, common questions that come up that we wanna make sure we could leave you with answers, uh, as part, as, as part of this presentation. So one question that comes up often is, is the aid of West European sovereign cloud subject to the Cloud Act? So if you don't know, if you haven't heard of the Cloud Act, that's actually a US law that standardizes how cross-jurisdictional legal requests, um, you know, law enforcement investigations, court orders, and so on are handled rather than having hundreds or thousands of police departments or judges just make it up on their own each time. There's a standardized process for this and goes through, uh, policies and procedures and so on. We've got a great blog post, a better approach to the Cloud Act that we put online a few months ago, and encourage you to just search for AWS Cloud Act. You'll get that blog post. It'll give you all, um, all the detail on it, bust some common myths about the Cloud Act and how it works and how it actually doesn't work. But, uh, one key takeaway I want you to have from that blog post is that when we build systems that have no technical means for us to access data, then we have no means to access that data. Um. Uh, and the one thing I would add, in addition to everything we've already put in that blog post that's specific to the AWS European sovereign cloud, is that all of the operational control rests entirely in the European Union. Only those EU operators have any control or permissions over that infrastructure. And so it's clear at all times that EU laws apply, uh, to those operators and to that operations. Very, very similar question as well. What about other lawful requests and orders, including from European governments and police agencies and so on? Same answer again, again, if we've built systems that mean we have no technical means to access data, then we have no means to access that data, um. Uh, we, all of our process here is highly standardized and is also something that again, the only folks with operational control or permissions over this infrastructure are EU operators in the EU. So, so it's clear at all times that EU law applies. Another common question we get is our sovereign customers usually have to worry about the kind of threats that I call movie plot threats, because you normally would see them in a movie. Well they'll ask questions like, well, what if one of your employees is a spy? Right. Or what if they're the target of some international espionage? What if they're the victim of some international, you know, targeted, uh, campaign, which could be as simple as phishing, getting to the wrong administrator, or as complex as, you know, a nation state sponsored custom malware attack. Well, and Midwest, we've long considered these kinds of insider threats just part of our basic threats model. We assume that all of these things can happen. And then design accordingly. And what that looks like is multi-person approval for sensitive actions, and then always on pervasive monitoring and detective controls. We've got many layers of this and a lot of defense in depth. This isn't something we talk about much in public. We don't go into detail about how those systems work, but we do from time to time do reviews with government security agencies and so on. And one of my favorite meetings was actually a meeting. One of these customers where we did a really thorough review and analysis, we showed how all of these layers work, how we've actually got sophisticated systems that are looking for suspicious activities. We're getting immediate reports about even innocuous things like typos just because they look unusual, um, and it's always on. And their feedback was that about half of what we've done would be enough. That we had just done overkill, um, and that's what we wanna hear. This is, uh, this is the type of controls we intentionally wanna make sure we very, very rigorously invest in and we're able to make investments and developments that typically go far beyond what a customer can do themselves in legacy on-prem environments or smaller scale infrastructure. We're just able, uh, to, to go much, much more deeply than they are. So we, we tend to have a really great story here. Another question we hear a lot from sovereign customers, what's our approach to business continuity planning? Well, the design for the AOS European sovereign Cloud, our region in Brandenburg, those are normal, very resilient, highly redundant patterns. We, we're building our data centers with our redundant, uh, technologies inside them. We separate our data centers and availability zones so they can't be vulnerable to, you know, the same natural disasters and, and events like that, and all of that comes as standard. In addition to that, in the European sovereign cloud, because we have those dedicated EU operators who are, who are running the cloud on a day to day basis, we have that additional layer of business continuity too, where you can imagine if, you know, for any reason, Europe or the European sovereign. Cloud we're just gonna, we're we're just separated somehow from the rest of the world or from the US. The European sovereign cloud will just keep running indefinitely. There's no, we don't have any known expiries or deadlines or anything in there that would just stop functioning. It would just keep going. Now the really short version of this is the European sovereign Cloud is what we've built in Europe, by Europe, for Europe. And just to double click on that buy Europe part, like Abby Abby was saying, we developed key systems like the AWSs Nitro system in Europe. It's actually developed in Dresden and in Berlin, or like the Cloudwatch service which is developed in in Dublin, Ireland. Um, but beyond that we actually have about 5000 builders in Europe, many of whom will be able to support the European sovereign cloud, so we have an enormous amount of talent and capacity in Europe, uh, and many of these people were part of the designs and build and security and isolation plans and so on for the European sovereign cloud. We've also, uh, we're not just designing and building these things, we're also testing them. In again, in Europe, so we've tested that we can actually isolate and separate the European sovereign cloud and that everything continues to work. That's really important. Hopefully you've gotten a sense now of the distinction of, you know, what kind of sovereign customers and workloads might be most suitable for the European sovereign cloud, um, you know, typically it is critical infrastructure, very critical systems, systems that go beyond the sovereignty, uh, the, the, the sovereignty levels that we're able to offer in our commercial regions. If you're interested in building in the European sovereign cloud, the best thing to do right now is to talk to your account manager. Um, it's, uh, it's actually possible to start building already in the sense that we're using the same APIs and same features and services that are available in any other AWS region, same SDKs and so on. Uh, so from a technical perspective, there should not be. Uh, any barriers or, or much difference in terms of, of how to build for the European sovereign cloud and applications should be highly portable. If you want even more detail, we've put out a full list of initial services that are gonna be there on day one. We also have more services that are landing after that, including, and even on day one we're gonna have our AI and ML services such as Bedrock. Uh, we've also got a very detailed white paper. Which dives deep into how the European sovereign cloud works, uh, and, and we have details on our controls and governance structure that we've published and made available for all this. Just go to our website. It's really easy to remember Hewest.au, uh, um, and, and that's where you'll find all of our material in particular for the European sovereign cloud. Now, we've been building this, and, uh, we're, our launch is imminent, uh, but we know that. We are still, we're just building the plumbing, we're building the infrastructure layer. The European sovereign cloud, it's still cloud infrastructure, and what I personally get the most excited by is, you know, when I come back to reinvent a year or the year after that, I'm really hoping I can hear stories of what customers have actually built on top of the European sovereign cloud, because I'm always humbled by the benefits that they've been able to deliver to actual end users, customers, and so on. In particular, I'm hoping we're able to make a real material difference in that risk profile that these customers face to just ordinary day to day threats of breaches from malware and ransomware and so on, that can plague those kind of on-prem environments. So with that, thank you very much for coming and listening to, to our talk about the European sovereign cloud. Uh, we'll be around outside if, if folks have additional questions, but enjoy the rest of Reinvent. Thank you.
