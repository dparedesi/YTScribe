summary: "This session, titled \"Building Agentic AI: Amazon Nova Act and Strands Agents in Practice\" (DEV327), provides a deep dive into the practical implementation of Agentic AI using AWS's cutting-edge toolset, specifically focusing on Amazon Nova Act and the newly open-sourced Strands Agents SDK. Speakers Hao Huang and Jackie Wu, both from AWS Hong Kong, guide forward-thinking developers through the rapid evolution of generative AI, moving from low-agency models requiring constant human oversight to high-agency, autonomous systems capable of sophisticated reasoning, planning, and executing complex workflows without intervention. Huang sets the stage by referencing Sequoia Capital's bold vision of an emerging \"agent economy,\" predicting a future where AI operates as a global neural network and enables the rise of \"one-person unicorns\"—companies valued at over a billion dollars run by a single individual leveraging an army of agents. He introduces the audience to Amazon Nova Act through a compelling hands-on demonstration, showing an agent that autonomously retrieves real-time Hong Kong weather information by navigating the Hong Kong Observatory website and verifying the data with a captured screenshot, all powered by the Model Context Protocol (MCP). He further illustrates the power of the Strands Agents SDK with a creative use case: an educational video generator that interprets natural language prompts to script and render precise mathematical animations using the Manim Python library. This demonstration emphasizes how the SDK simplifies development by handling complex \"Chain of Thought\" reasoning and task orchestration with minimal coding effort. Transitioning to enterprise-scale applications, Jackie Wu explores the necessity of multi-agent collaboration, arguing that decomposing monolithic agents into specialized teams—such as researchers, analysts, and risk managers—significantly enhances system precision, scalability, and maintainability. He details four distinct collaboration patterns supported by Strands Agents: \"Agents as Tools,\" where a central orchestrator delegates specific sub-tasks; \"Swarm,\" a decentralized model where agents collaborate continually without a single \"boss\"; \"Graph,\" which enforces strict, predictable information flow between nodes; and \"Workflow,\" designed for linear, highly repeatable processes like data pipelines. Wu grounds these abstract concepts in reality with two sophisticated financial prototypes: a quantitative hedge fund simulation where agents autonomously generate, code, and backtest trading strategies against historical market data, and an \"Agentic Fund Manager\" that constructs investment portfolios tailored to specific user risk profiles. The presentation concludes by reinforcing that while AWS provides the robust infrastructure—from infrastructure layers to developer software—success in the agentic era requires not just technical adoption but a fundamental shift in mental frameworks towards \"spec-driven development\" and organizational readiness."

And uh uh welcome to today's session and you know the, uh, now the agentic AI has emerged as one of the most uh exciting topic, uh, uh, in today's GI landscape. So as a forward-thinking developers, I know you are looking to, to go beyond just understanding the series or concepts or terminologies. So you want to see the Real scenarios or real innovations in actions and then how to, how to maybe you want to build, you want to build your own AI agents applications from ground up. So that's exactly what we are here to deliver today. I'm Hao Huang, a senior developer advocator, uh, uh, at AWS based in Hong Kong, and, uh, I'm honored to join my colleague Jackie Wu, who is senior solution architecture also from Hong Kong. Yeah, thank you, yeah, thanks for joining the session. Hope you enjoyed. So today we will, uh, take you through how to build agentic AI on AWS, uh, uh. In, in practice using, using Amazon Nova Act and the stress agents. So uh uh we will pro we will uh bring you a lot of demonstrations from my side. I will put two demo hands-on demonstrations of AI agents. Yes, one is interactive information uh uh agent and the other is educational video creation. Agent and Jackie will bring more uh uh multi-agent, he will use some, in some financial scenarios later. And here is the agenda for today. First, we will start with some fundamental like to explore how AI agents concept to ensure we are all on the same page. Then, next, I will provide a hands-on demonstration showing you how to build a real. Agent application for Hong Kong weather information using MCP and the Amazon Nova Act. Then we will dive into a real world applications by, by exploring how to build a Uh, enterprise agentic AI solutions from the ground up, uh, using open source street agents, you know, open source, uh, street agent is AWS uh recently opened contribution to the open source communities uh following. U JK will bring some valuable experience from the capital markets. Well, uh, he will introduce you to for multi-agent collaboration patterns and the tools with the, uh, open source street agents SDK and uh he will also demonstrate these concepts through two practical financial use cases. And finally, we will ramp up and uh to uh with a comprehensive uh overview of AWS complete uh agenda AI portfolio. Let's begin by example the future trend of the, of the uh agentic AI first. So if we dive deep into the evolution of generative AI you will see that it has followed a clear progression, so which each, each phase uh uh uh bring a new priorities and challenges for business. So on the left you see the Low agency and the more human oversight and which are rule-based and require high human oversight. So on the right we see high agency systems and can operate independently and and even make some strategic decisions by themselves, by agents themselves. So, but in reality. Actually, we are still at the very beginning, uh, uh, stage of the Agentech AI. So, so, uh, reaching higher, uh, agency uh requests not just the bad technologies but also maybe as you know, some governance, maybe some trust and some organization readiness. We will dive deep into that topic later. So although we are still in the very early stage of agentic AI that has uh inversion of future world powered by AI agent. I would like to recommend uh this uh Sequoia Capital's keynote address uh AI uh sent 2025 in San Francisco, so which is also referenced here. So Sequoia Capital predicts that future AI system will go beyond the. Carrying the tool-like attributes and they're involved into autonomously operating intelligent agents. So these intelligent agents will have capability for reasoning, for planning, for collaboration and high autonomous operation. So the most striking aspect of the sequoia capital's prediction on, on the right is uh, is their vision for the 20-30s Asian economy. It will operate like a global neural network, so composed of numerous agent operations and forming an interconnected network. So as, as illustrate on the right. So put simply, If in the future, if the AI agent you designed uh uh adopted by the majority of people, for example, in Hong Kong, so you could maybe, you, you make enough money to buy a house in Hong Kong, right? But uh and if the AI agents you design uh adopted by most people worldwide. Then congratulations, you, you will have the exciting chance to become a very rich man. So I think right, the, the, the, the right is the, the forecast of the square capital for the 20-30s. So uh uh it's very important because I think it will make everyone know uh what we should do, uh, make every developer know uh what we should do in the future. OK. Sequoia Capital also uh have some broad protection in their keynote address. The upcoming emergency of the first uh one-person Unicorn means a company will created and operate by a single individual. And with a valuation of $1 billion US dollars, so this will shift the in, in, in labor structure has given rise to an entire new organization models, which means a business that can be run by a single person while he or she can, uh, can do or perform all the functional capabilities and the scale of the complete startup. So, additionally, if you look close to the right for the, for the stochastic mindset which is my favorite here, so uh the emerging uh world of AI agent requests to adopt an entire different way of thinking. So I know when we work with large language models, uh, many developers or, or, or they, they complain that, that output are, are not very accurate or, or fail to meet our human being expectations, right? So, when facing these frustrations, I would encourage you to consider, uh, uh, a complete different uh perspective, perhaps it's our, our way to To connect with large language models or connect with AI's uh lead to adjustment. So this is why you, in 2025, uh, forward thinking AI ID like Kiro KIRO so featured a crucial capabilities which is a straight uh spec-driven development. So this is another topic I. I'm not uh going to dive deep into it cause my, my time is limited, but however, I hope, uh, I hope you to understand this, to succeed in the new era of uh agentic AI you must prepare mentally in areas you may not be well considered not only in the technique technology but also in some. Maybe uh will cause some changes in the, in the organization's uh uh future organization structure and you, your mental frameworks as well. OK, so, uh, in, in 2025, we see that much of the uh foundational instructor for the future world of agentic AI is, is already under construction. For example, uh if we, uh, communication protocol, protocols, so during the, uh, uh, during the development of internet, the TCPIP protocol uh laid the foundation for, for network interconnections, so. Similarly, in the emergence of the agentic AI, AI agents also require interoperabilities, so both with their own tools and also they want to connect with other AI agents as well. So, some emergency stands such as MCP and A2A are addressing these challenges. So, uh uh here I am not going to dive deep into MCP and A2A but I want to Address, uh, what I want to focus is now AWS is actively participate in the stands committees for both MCP and A2A projects to contribute Amazon's decades of experience in distributing systems and to enhance this future protocols. So, this is the complete AWS Agenda AI portfolios comprised of a comprehensive architecture with uh with uh uh uh uh uh with, with some uh supporting services. So from the bottom to the top, you will see these services are organized into three layers, infra layers, the AI and the agent, developer. Uh, software layers and the, the application layers and each layer continue uh contains more specific service categories. And today we will focus on the AI and the agent development software and services and uh for uh for the SDKs for agents part, lower act and the street agents and uh uh JQ will dive more uh dive deep into more. Detail or more scenarios uh into this, these two, this SDKs for agents uh part as well. Yes, we have discussed extension for the future of, of agentic AI. So next, I will showcase uh practical agentic AI applications that automatically retrieve local weather information uh in, in Hong Kong, but I think uh since this you can very easily, you maybe you just need to change the URL you can make it this agentic AI applications easy to use in your country. As well. So, here's a practical AI uh agent scenarios demonstrate the local weather application development using the MCP protocol, Amazon Nova Act, and the Hong Kong Observatory website. Let's play the video first, yes. Yeah, in this video demonstration, you, we simply provided our agent build with Emerald over A with a special website URL then we just uh uh directly uh interact with our, with it using later language, uh, English, you can also, you can use, using Spanish or, or, or, or, or Chinese as well. Such as what's the current weather in Hong Kong. So next we will observe that amazement as the agent can uh begin to function like a human being, uh, verb scripting engineer. So it autonomously located where the information from the Hong Kong uh website and saved uh, a screenshot file in my computer for verification. Yes. The screenshot. Here. So if you are a word scrapping engineer, this video might be somewhat shocking cause whether you embrace it or not, the, the error of agentic AI has arrived. So you may want to prepare, uh, prepare for your future and uh uh AWS services like the Emerald Lover Act and later the Swiss agents and the agent called. Uh, we, uh, actually, we, we announced the more of the agent core features in the, in the keynote yesterday so may help you in the, in the huge transition. OK, so, you may want to know the detail about how to implement the AI agent using Aron overact. It's, it's, it's straightforward. So, the left screenshot shows the wrong overact forecast functions which guide ML overact. On which specific verbal pages to capture and what actions to perform and notably we directly use the later language to assign like the, uh, uh read and extracted the complete 9 days weather forecast information uh visible on this page and we provided the, the, the URL which is uh with the Hong Kong observatory. Uh, website, uh, with the starting page and on the right, right screenshot demonstrate a typical MCP core, uh, filtering the market MCP to decorator and the process of running over actor in separate thread. You, you may notice that uh that uh uh. The, the function which is the The function here is the, is the same like the, the, on the right, we, we just run overactive forecast. Uh, yes, if you are uh if you are interested in the detail about how we, uh, implement the, the, the, the, the code wrapper is on the right, right side, yeah. So if you are curious about the technical details about how we implemented this AI agent, you can read the two technical blog posts we write specifically on this topic and the first part of the, of the post primary introduce how to independently, so just to design the AI agent application using embryo Nova Act and the second part demonstrate how to implement uh AI agent with MCP. And uh Amazon overact and, and if you want to do some, uh, using some outside source uh you provide, you need some maybe your, your own data so you want to build them together that you can refer to the, to the part two or to the second blog post. You can scan the QR code on the right to access detail. OK, so in the previous example, we demonstrate how to rapidly uh uh build an AI agent using Nova Actor. However, I understand many of the uh developers, they uh they won't stop there. They want, they have even great ambitions, right? They uh some uh developers in, in Hong Kong and uh uh uh China, they They told me they, they want to build their own agenda AI applications from scratch and they want to maintain complete source uh code level control. So, so they want to control their, their every line of their code. So in this, in such cases, uh, uh, open source street agents can help you to achieve this goal that I will discuss later. If you like me and have spoken with many pioneer developers of agentic AI, you will, you will, uh, share my insight into the numerous challenges here. When, when the developers want to build their own custom uh agent at this moment. So, on the input side, on the input side left, we need connectors that enable agent to, to interact with diverse enterprise systems. So, so, uh, that's why uh the, where the tools and MCP come in so the Orchestrator access to this input, so the agent isn't just answering questions but actually uh executing workflows like maybe booking hotel, may maybe updating some information or maybe trigger some processes. So in the top sections, we need another important component for building customized AI uh agent systems memory. Uh, including short-term memory and long-term memory. So short-term memory allows agent to maintain context within a session. And their, their long term memory so enable them to learn and improve over time. So on the right side you have the brain, the large language models, but instead of treat it as a stand alone. So sometimes you need to extend it to be a reason uh to be a more complex frameworks uh using like the reactor, like the reflection and a channel of thought. So and this tech Techniques allow the model to plan, reflect, and the reasoning step by step. And the bottom section is shows we still need to consider additional uh element. So, because every agent lead a persona, so a set uh like uh a set of rules or, or instructions that define the, the agent is and how should uh should behave and this differentiates an HR agent from uh uh uh maybe a dev ops agent or some maybe a custom support agent. And Jackie will also discuss some specific implementation of this aspect in detail uh when you want to, want to uh do some multi-agent orchestration. So finally, we need to uh customize all the AI agents to provide the observabilities and guardrails to keep the agent safe, debatable, and aligned with our goals. So based on all uh all the custom leads outlined here, you may have already realized that building a truly functional AI agent require. Substantial works and uh maybe potentially over 80% or even 90% of the effort being unrelated to your unique uh business logic and the processes. So, how to make, so you can, you may have questions. So how to make AI agent development more efficient, that is AWS provides uh the framework for you. Yeah. This is Swiss agents. So what is street agent? Street agent is Amaro's recent contribution to the global open source community. It's an SDK that enable our developers to build AI agents with minimal code, and there's a framework simplified development by eliminating complex agent orchestrations instead, uh, uh, and help us to leverage in the. The, the state of the art large language models to handle planning, chain of thought to callings and others. Next, let me show you how to rapidly build a complex real world uh agentic AI applications using the open sourcetra agent. Yeah, here's the demo. So in the second demonstration, I will showcase the creation of mathematic animation using MIAM. So it's a present library designed specifically for high quality mathematical virtualization and, and the, the street agents will process a A user prompt and write a precise Mali script and generate a polished animation like this to demonstrate the powerful capabilities uh uh to, to combine with maybe with switch agents and some, some uh Python libraries, some uh or some open source projects together. And next step uh deep into a detailed analysis of the core implementation code for, for this demo. It's very straightforward so, so I can show here. So the initial code segment imports the agent class from the street module and MCP client class for the uh uh for the string to MCP to establish essential component for system to utilize agent and the message control protocols within the framework. And uh, yes, and the following code segment sets up a connection to a many MCP server using send input and output as a trans, as a transport mechanism. And the falling code. Yes, and the next, the code establish a connection for interaction with the mainland MCP server. It retrieves available tools and uh from, from MCP server and using the MCP client and the initial the agent with their tools, preparing for the upcoming uh task maybe like the uh the chat, chat loop or like that or if you want to design for more other task. Yeah, And finally, it's very simple, it's very important, but it's very simple if you use this agents. The code use the agent to process a later language prompt, request a many animation. The prompt is asking for uh virtualization of some specific cubic function graph, functions uh from X equals -3 to X equals 3. At this video, let me play it first. And this video demonstrates the complete process of building agentic AI applications use switch agent SDK to perform mathematic virtualization. So in VR Studio, two terminal windows are utilized. The left one is runs MCP server and uh And which connect to the uh Mali MCP server while the stand uh STDIO transport and the right terminal runs MCP client programs which launches the video generation chat interface. And through this interface, users can input your later language comment like for example, create a mailing scene that draw a cubic functions from maybe X ranges in in 9 seconds and after submission, the right terminal will show the agent process the later language uh request. And uh interesting, yes, when I developed this is, is uh you, you, you see that there is um uh detecting uh Uh, some issues, some combination issues in my local environment, the agent intelligently created a simplified version to complete the task to demonstrate its adaptive, adaptive problem solving capabilities. And the agent successfully, already successfully complete the task and provided the output summaries and the, the final MP4 we do file generated by the AI. Agent is here. Yes. So now it's, it's easy, very easy to, to design uh educational videos now, right? You just need to use some uh later language as an input. And the, the agent can help you with this. Yeah, that's. I want to introduce this cause I think it's a, it's the future, it's uh, of the educational AI agent in the future. It's very simple because it's only uh I designed this program just maybe in, in 30 minutes. So maybe you can use uh 3 days or 1 week to, to make a real uh uh enterprise level. AI agent. Yeah. OK. So uh if you are, just complete the whole process of building uh uh agentic AI application for, for this. So if you are interested in this case, you can scan the QR code here, left is to rewatch the video and the right is to get the, to access the complete demo code for these examples. Yes, and this concludes my presenting, uh, presentation for today, and thank you all for listening. Next, I will hand over the time over to Jackie. Thank you. Thank you, Hao Wen. Thank you. So I hope you're enjoying so far. So thanks, Hawn, introducing about Nova X and also about the strength agents. So first, I'll do a quick survey. If you are a developer, may raise your hands, please? Sorry. OK, so how much do you use the VS codes like in the code? OK. OK, you are done, that's great. So how many of you have already written the agent by yourself? OK, good, good. Still a few of them. So, uh, uh, as to my this part, so I could introduce myself. So this is Jackie. So I'm also come from Hong Kong and I'm as solutions architect, mainly serve the financial service industries. So, and in the coming, uh, almost 25 or half an hour, I will talk about multi-agent corporations. Uh, as we are developer, right? So I'm, I'm also a developer. So people know nowadays, you can have the monolithic and you also have the containerized microservices. So why multi-agent, the concept is very similar. So for agent, you can let lots of, lots of actions, tools, you can let a huge monolithic agents, but why multi-agent? First, specialization. Right, if you have a specialized agents, so it will work in the specific domains, so it can increase the precision, and so that you can, you can have a more precise answers, and all combine those specialized agents, you can achieve the superior outcome. scalability. So because you have those agents and those sub-agents, so during the work life we can add or remove the agents without impacting the whole systems. So this is how it can scalable. Maintainability. So, uh, just as a quick survey site where most of them are developed here. So, question is very simple. If you debug 100 line code and another debug 1, 10,000 line of code, the difficulty is very, very different, right? So, with the small agent and then you can, it's easier to control, to monitoring, to debug, test all the things. Finally, about cost. Uh, so, as AWS even uh in the yesterday met government, our CEO keynotes, right, choice matters. Uh, because you have the, the model, typically we see the model of three different scenario, right? One is about smartness, the leasing capacity. Two is about the speed, how fast can this bounce. The third one is about the cost, right? How cost efficient it is. So, if you use the multi-agent, which means for one specific agent, you can choose this, you can match your task capacity with the right model, right, can be fast, can be very performance, can be very cost efficient. And I will, in short, I will think, think the single agent like a specialized skill solo work, while the multi-agent system is like a well coordinated team. As I worked in hedge fund before. The monolithic agents is like a trader, like mental portfolio all by himself, but multi-agent is like a team, right? You can have the analysts to the market research. You can have the quants doing the modeling, you can have the traits, extra traits, you can have risk manager, manor whole portfolio risk. You can have the IT maintain the underlying infrastructure. So when, when they combine together, they can achieve the superior performance. And in this way, but there is a condition here is they can work together, right? So how can they work together? The patterns, the patterns. So, scarce agents can support multi-agent collabbation patterns, but agents as tools, one graph, workflow. So, and in the coming session, I will talk about those patterns one by one. And first, I will introduce what they is, and then I will use real life example to showcase how the pattern can help you. Let's start with agent code. For the agent codes, you always have a so-called orchestrator agents, so which will receive the user requirements, understand the intent, and then It will call the specialized agent to perform the specific task. Take this as an example. Here, we have the orchestrated agents. When the users and the requirements, they want to travel around, right? So, for example, for example, if I travel to Las Vegas, by the way, this is my first time here. I mean, I'm very honored to share the session with you. So first, The orchestrator agents will receive the requirements and then he passed to the research agents. It will search, OK, where you can play like the uh antelope, canon, like uh all the things, and then it will go pass to the product recommendation assistance. So which means the input of the agents, or the trade agents will make it as a, as out um sorry, the output of the research assistance, uh, the oxygen agents will make the input to the next agents. And OK, that's the theory. Now, like I will make a real life example. In the quantitative hedge fund, yeah, nowadays, so the quantitative methodology is very important, especially for those quant researchers. They need to verify their trading idea very fast. So, when they fail fast, that means they can find the right trading strategy faster. So, yeah, for example, they say, OK, it's a moving average crossover, it's a good trading strategies. They may have, you may have a different ideas, right? So, how the agentic AI help them? And thanks to, uh, I come from Hong Kong and I make this demo with my Hong Kong colleague, Charlie Cheu. Yeah. So, here is the simple input. You can input like the, uh, the stock that you are interested, like the Amazon, OK, backtest window. So the backtest which means you use the historical market data to verify your ideas and then you get, you can get some metrics like the the profit and the loss, like the Sharpe ratio Sharpe ratio, so which means how much risk you take and how much profit you get. And then you can also Get a buy condition and sell condition uh when you want to buy the stock or when you want to sell the stock. And then you can run the backtest. And in our sample, it will give the backtest results, OK, how much you make and uh as well, it will give you suggestions, OK, for your trading strategies, whether it's good or not, how to improve the trading strategy, what's the risk behind and any alert. So that's the sample input and output. So you may understand what's behind this stuff, like I think developers or architects, you like the architecture diagrams. So here we got the orchestration agents here and which you will call different tools and agents. So here we got two tools, which is market data tools, and another one is backtest tools. And we also got two agents here, so strategy generation agents and the result summary agents. And the orchestrated agents, the quant research agents is orchestrated agents. We will call the sub-agents. In the coming slides, I will focus on the three components here. So first, I will show you how to use agent called gateway to build the tools, and then it can be used in the agents. And second one, I will show you the agent called Ram, how to host the strategy generation agents and make the agents as a tool, which will be used by the current research agents. Let's start with the tools. Amaz Amazon SciMaker uh agent called Gateway. So it's provides an easy and secure way for developers to build tools for agents. So you can encapture the API or lender functions or your existing services into MCP compatible tools. Here, I will use the lambda function as a back end gateway target. So I store the historical market data in the S3 table, and then this is the function. I will define the catalog. After I log in the catalog, I can start to search the market data I will use in the gateway. After I define the lander function, I will make the lander function as the target of the gateway. OK. First, I will create a gateway first. OK. It's very simple with agent call start to uh tool kit. So agent called gateway create MC gateway. You give the name and then in the council, you found the agent, the gateway is created. After the game was created, you will also notice that in impact identity here. Which is a cognito by default. So that when your agents, orchestrator try to call this tool, you need to authenticate so you can get a secure environment. And then as a tool, like the agents will always know you should define a clear input and output of the, of the lender functions. That's why here I see the name is get market data, OK. And then in future, when the agent. Uh, quantity such agents try to call this tool, it will trigger the tool, get market data and you also get the input parameters here. OK. Now, I have the gateway ready there, so I will make the gateway a tool to the current research agents. First, how we I just mentioned like you can call the tool calculator, right, to make, to make it a tool and then you can give the doxin, OK, to define what it is, what's the arguments, what's the return, and then you, as mentioned, the gateway will use the cognito by default to do the authentication. And then, I will, after authorization, after the cognito authentication, I will call the gateway, use the HTTPX clients, and then I will able to get historical market data to do my backtesting. That's about the gateway. That's after we define the market data tools and then we will define the strategy generation agents. And for our agents, we will deploy to agent called LAT. So agent called LT provide a secure and a fast way and specialized tools to host your agents. Here, I, I define the definitely from the strengths I import agent. And then I define the instru instructions. So it's a, it's a trading strategy code generator. I use a back trader framework. So please generate the code for me, OK? Just give me the Python code because this code will be executed later. And then I define, give the name, give the system prompt, give the model to views, and by the way, you can notice that in the, in the strategy generation agents, I use this loud sonnet. So to lever it is a coding capacity, right? And later you will found for another agents, I use NA model, so which is good in summarization. So this is also the benefits that I just talked very beginning, right? You can use different uh language model for different subagents. And once I have it, how I to deploy the agent to the runtime? So first I will from the backlog agent called input the backlog agent called apps. So after I input the apps, what you need is you give the app entry points. So to specify once the agent is triggered, which way it will be triggered, and then I have to run. OK, by default, if you're listening to port 8080. And once the code is ready, I will deploy to agent quarantine. It's quite simple actually, right? For the agent quarantine, you can just use agent call config to specify the files and also the requirement files, right? Um, you can have the dependents, a lot of dependents, so that agent call run time will install for you and build the container. And then agent call launch. So after agent call launch, you will get, you will. Get the runtime agents in your council and then you can also check the status, agent got status to check it. So this is how quickly that you can deploy to the agent core, right? So someone may ask you, OK, I do not use Python, I use Java, or for example, right? You can build your own container, right? So just, uh, just to combine to the agent core runtime protocol, you can have your own, bring your own container to deploy to the agent quarantine. And after that, I will make the agent as a tool. Similarly, so I use the chance at toolol calculator and then generate the trading strategies and I specify the arguments. So please note here, the input, I'm expecting adjacent, adjacent file. So you can see the name, the buy condition, sell condition, which I just mentioned at the very beginning, right? So this is the input. And then here, I use the agent called run time. Uh, uh, to invoke the agent call times. So this is how I make the, uh, agents as tools. So after you define the two tools, marketed the tool, you define the strateg generation agents, you define run factors tools, you define the result summary agents. Now come to the current research agent, which is the orchestror agents. It's quite simple. From chance, I will import agents. You give the system prompt, right? So for a current, uh, uh, trading, uh, strate uh strategist, you would like to, OK, get historical market data, generate the strategy, run the strate code, analyze the results. So basically that's the prompt means. I would like to focus on the tools here because this pattern, remember, right, is the agent as a tool. So here you can see I got the 4 tools, first the market data, generate strategy, run backtest, and create the result summaries. So, and if, if the, there is something wrong here, the orchestrator, the quant research agents will relearn the gender code. So, uh, let's see, see a quick demo. Yeah. So if you have a look at this, you will find that I use the kilo, kilo CLI to run the commands. So it's perfect for my debugging because when you write the kilo already know the output and then it will help you debug much faster. OK, I ask the kilo CLI to run the quant agents for me. So, and here it will use the tool execute patch. And then you here you can say the JSON file. So I use, OK, 10 day period uh simple moving average crossover 30 day simple moving average. First, the strategy will try to go the first tools, which is generate trading strategies. And here you can see it first, the agents will make the JSON input, right? Remember, right? I define the input as uh as a JSON file, so you can see the ad JSON formats. And then it's perfect to generate such the crossover strategy for me. So in the Python file, you can see how it process, how to generate the trading signals. OK, it's finished allowed 6 seconds. After I can generate codes, I will, the agent called the fetch market data while the, the gateway and here you can see the HTTP request to the gateway here. So the symbol is Amazon, right, which is I defined the very beginning. And then, OK, because I defined 1 year, so you can see around 200 data points uh uh retrieved from the gateways. And the third step, it will run the actual backtest itself. You can see here, you can get a sample data that I will use in the backtest and then Because I use the back trade framework, so celeblow engine. Ceblow engine is the core components about backtra framework. And then uh here you can also say I need to feed the market data into the Slow so that you know the market data and then you will try to backtest the strategy. And the output here, you can say, OK, that's the initial value and then, OK, I, what's the what's the profit you get and what's the total return and finally, OK, it will try to create the result summary, OK. And what it is and how, how it needs to be improved. So here I also use agent called memory here. So because I saved the backtest result in the agent called memory. So and in the third step, I will just fetch it from the memory. So this is how you process it. And here, yeah, I mean definitely for different coins, they may have different intention like, here I give the summary, I give you the recommendations, I give the alerts and uh uh and also the key concerns, how I can improve my trading strategies. So if you are interested, so you can scan the live demo here. So, to verify, to create your own strategy. So, definitely, OK, this is just for information, this does not constitute any investment wise. OK. So please, please consult with a qualified financial analyst. OK So that's about the agents as tools. Now, the second one I want to discuss about swarm. Now, the swarm actually is a fundamental different patterns. In the agents tool, you can see the orchestrator agents. While in the swarm pattern, there's no single boss, OK. The agents communicate with each other and collaborate dynamically to solve the problem. The swan maintains a shared context so that all agents can access. So it's about uh who is, who is in the swan system, what's other agents, the input and output, what's historical interactions. Let's use this one as example, right? You got the research agent, creative agent, critical agents, some right agents. So I, I, I want to write a blog or all the things. So here you can def I, the first I define the four different agents here, right. So, one to do the research and the one is to be creative, to create something. And then the third one is how to challenge what you already created. And finally, I will do the summarize to give the final results. And then from the chint multi-agents, I import SW class. And the Swan class, I give the four agents and I definitely I define the max hand handoff uh max interactions so that it won't run, run infinitely. And also I do not want the two agents can make each other the ping pong that, that, that, that, that loop. So I have the repeative handoff detection window and also the repetitive handoff many, many unique agents, which means in the last agent hand off, at least 3 agents shall be involved. So, let's see how it works. Yeah, OK. So the task is, please create a blog post, explain it agentic AI and then create summary for a social media blog. So, first, it will create a blog and then a social media post. Let's see how it works. First, once it, once the swarm received the request, it will first call the Research agents, because it knows, I need to find what information I can gathering, right? So these are facts. You need the research agents. After research agents found the staff, and then it will try to call the creative. Uh, agents, right, because you need to create an engaging blog and it knows, OK, after I create a blog, I will hand off to the summarizer agents to create the social media post. And the interesting happens here. In the summarize agents. It definitely, you, you will try to create a post. However, it found that In order to create a family. I see the general structure of the blog post from the creative agents descriptions, but I need more details to create an effective social media summary. So this is the reasoning from the summarized agents. In this way, it will, won't hand over to the staff. You will hand over back to the creative agents so that it will feel the content. And now the creative agents received, they say, OK, now let me create a comprehensive blog post and then hand off to the summarized agent again. And finally, the summarized agents are able to create the blog and also the post. And here you can see, OK, there are total 5 interactions. And also for the sense uh agent framework, we also have the tools, right? So from sense tools, I can import a swarm tool and when I define the agents, I have import a tool as a swarm and then in the, in the results, OK, use a swarm of 3 agents to analyze or to do the scenes. And these agents will spin off 3 agents to do the task. So this is use a swarm as a tool. Now I discuss about agents tool, swamp patterns. The third one I will discuss about graph. In graph pattern, you can define the agent relationship as a graph network. So each agent is a node, and the edge between them define the relationship, define the information flow, how they can communicate with each other. So the key advantage of the go pattern is predictability and also the control, right? In this graph, for example, the economic department can only communicate with the market research and the financial analyst. And it is not allowed to communicate with social analyst or technical analyst. So this is how you have the predictability and full control about information flow. I would like to use an example, the agentic Fund Man developed by our Korean colleague, Kwon Lee. OK. So Kwon developed this agentic AI fund uh fund manager here. So maybe it's not complicated. I will use two specific agents here to demonstrate the graph here. So, first, it will about the portfolio architect and then about fund manager. So, similarly, always I define agent first. OK. So this one, I will define how it will construct the portfolio, OK, to fulfill the customer requirements. So here you can get a prompt, define the agents. I know you, you are, you should be very familiar with this now. And then In the graph, we have the nodes, right? So I will define the portfolio nodes. In the portfolio nodes, which, which will trigger the age, it's also deploy to agent call, right? So it will call the agent with streaming. And finally, let's talk about Talk about the fund mandate itself. I use this example to showcase that chance agents SDK it can work with very generic, generic other open source or popular a genetic framework. So here you can see, I use the chance agent to work with a long graph, right, I know you work with a long chain and all other popular frameworks. Like for this one, I use a long chain here and you can define, OK, from the graph, long graph, the graph, I input the state graph. And the state graph, I define the workflow here. So I add the nodes of financial, add nodes of the portfolio which I defined, and also add nodes of the risk. And then after I add nodes, I add the edge, OK. So from the financial to the portfolio, from the portfolio to risk, and the risk is the end nodes. So this is how I use the graph to define the nodes and then the edge. So you can have a full control. So if you are interested, you can have the demo and also the code depot developed by Kuwan Lee. I OK, so agent as tool. Swan, graph. The last one is workflow. As a workflow is quite um straightforward for us, right? So you can have a very, very well defined sequence or patterns. Here you can say, OK, I have the, the research agents and then analysis agents and then finally, the report agents. So, here you can say when I define the, from the change tools, I import workflow and in the workflow, I define several tasks and in the task, I define the dependency. Yeah, so, for example, the task ID trend and analysis will depend on the data extraction. And then the task report generation will depend on the trend analysis. So this is how you define the workflow. You can also have the priority here. So, so that if you have multiple, multiple sub-agents, they can run parallel and that the priority will determine which run first. So we talk about those 4 different uh patents, right? So agent is tool and all the forces in this, in this coming 5 minutes, so I will give some sample use case so that you can apply your own company after you leave Las Vegas. First agent is tools, so. For example, customer service chatbot can be a good example, right? So when you receive the customer request, the orchestrated agents can call the, can call your technical account manager, can call your bidding agents, and they can call, can call your summarize agents and then provide output to your customers. And then the swamp patterns, right? For the swamp patterns, so those individual agents, so interact locally, right, and then to produce a complex emergent behavior without centralized control. So here, for example, for the multi, multidisciplinary incident response, right, if you have any instance, you may have different problems, right? First, you, you may think it's like a networking issue, right? And then you pass a network agents. And then the network agents will check itself and from no, it's not my, it's not my problem. It's can be the data database problem. And then the password database agents and the database agent will check, OK, and then solve it, right. So here you can see those agents, the dynamic can make it with each other. And the graph. So as I just mentioned that the graph enable complex communicated while maintaining the well-controlled information flow. You can define which agent can communicate which which which agent. So, like the data validation with error path, right. So you can control, OK, first you We have an, have an agent to determine, OK, which has a problem, uh whether it has no errors and then is passed to different agents. One can be the data validation without error. Another can be the data agent with error path, right? So this is how you clearly define the graph, network graph, right? And finally, it's about the workflow, right? So, the workflow is a perfect match. I mean, if you have a complex and a repeatable process and you want to encapture in a, in a single reliable and usable tools, right? And so, for example, for the For the automated data pipelines, right? So you have data the if, if, uh, if you do have a data engineer here, right? So you have the data extraction, you have the data, you have the data pipe, uh, data, uh ETL, right? You will, you will, uh, do the data transform, right, and then you will have load data into a data warehouse or all the things and then build a pipeline. So this is a perfect match for the workflow. So, So let's the full pattern about the chances uh agents that you can leverage and I, uh, and now let's quick uh recap what we discussed. So as how we just introduced about our AWS agentic AI portfolio, I believe you see this diagram lots of times I mean during our event. So again, so I would like to welcome you to the event and I hope you enjoying the session. So today we're focused on NAX and the strength agents. And also we do a uh quick dem uh demo here, right. So we demo the weather AI application, the manual video generation, and also I and my Hong Kong colleague Charlie Cheu developed the agentic practice testing and my Korean colleague Kuangwan Lee developed the agentic AI fund managers. So please feel free to take a picture here and later you can check the code depot and show that, uh, check the demo itself. So, and finally, I, we would like to have your feedback here. So please open your, uh, open your apps and so give us your, your feedback, and your feedback is important for us, to, for us to improve, and also I hope you enjoyed the last of the event. Thanks for coming and I thank you for coming to our session. Have a great day.
