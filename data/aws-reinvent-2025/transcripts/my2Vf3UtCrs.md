>> What if Mars, one of the
world's largest consumer goods companies in the world, could
run every ad image through compliance in seconds, saving
thousands of hours as checks are done instantly? What if
AstraZeneca, makers of some of the most innovative drugs,
could automate the paperwork needed to get treatments
approved all over the world, saving months of painstaking
manual work and getting life saving treatments to people
faster? And what if Qualcomm, the global technology leader,
could uncover the most efficient places to put
marketing spend in real time, dramatically boosting campaign
performance while saving millions in the process? This
is not just the promise of AI. This is all happening today,
right now with agentic AI from Writer. I'm May Habib Writer,
co-founder and CEO. And over the last five years, we've
worked with the world's largest companies in the most highly
regulated industries to build a platform for Agentic work.
Early on, we saw a gap between the amazing things these Llms
were capable of and what would meet the Enterprise's bar for
reliability, security, and control. We made a bold
decision to be a full stack platform, one that has the
precision and compliance that enterprises need. It's powered
by our own enterprise grade Palmyra LLMs and delivers
agents that handle the toughest enterprise workflows. To truly
scale our full stack vision. We needed an infrastructure
provider that was resilient, secure, and engineered for the
enterprise. The majority of the fortune 500 run on AWS,
including so many of our customers. So teaming up with
AWS was a no brainer. AWS stands alone as The Cloud
provider that enables us to both train our frontier models
and deploy our entire platform securely to our enterprise
customers. Our work with AWS started two years ago with the
model layer. We had just launched our latest Palmyra
LLMs and it was posting top scores on leaderboards. But as
our models got larger, the computational power that was
needed for both training and inference was growing. And
that's where the depth of the AWS stack became a strategic
advantage. Our foundation is built on SageMaker HyperPod,
which gives us a powerful service for large scale model
training. We use P5 instances and soon P6e instances to
handle the heavy GPU workloads. And they're connected with
Elastic Fabric Adapter, which is what makes the high speed
communication between nodes possible. So our training runs
stay fast and synchronized. We've also paired HyperPod with
Amazon FSx for Lustre, so we get data at the speed our
models need while keeping costs under control. And the results
have been enormous. We've been able to do runs at a third of
the time, going from six weeks down to two weeks. And our
training pipelines have become 90% more reliable. All that
work gives us the power and stability to build our latest
frontier model. Palmyra X5 trained right on HyperPod. X5
gives exceptional adaptive reasoning a massive 1 million
token context window and near perfect accuracy in extracting
business insights from even the most complex, high volume data.
And it delivers this with incredible speed. A million
token prompt in just 22 seconds, and Multi-turn function calls
in 300 milliseconds, outpacing other frontier models at a
fourth of the cost. But our relationship with AWS was never
just about creating fast, powerful models. It's always
been about building a breakthrough AI platform that
can transform how businesses operate. And with Palmyra X5 as
the engine, we're delivering on that vision with Writer
enterprise teams at companies like Mars and AstraZeneca and
Qualcomm. Work smarter by connecting agents to the data,
to the context, and to the business know how. That
transforms critical processes, all without business users
needing to write a single line of code. Playbooks are central
to Writer. They let teams capture a process once linking
the tools, the data, and the systems they rely on and
turning them into repeatable, intelligent agents. A playbook
becomes a living, dynamic blueprint for how great work
gets done. And because they're shared across teams, the
highest impact playbooks can be scaled across organizations
instantly. And very soon, with the help of AWS, Writer is
going to be including our next generation of Self-evolving
Llms that can learn how organizations operate and
anticipate requests on the fly. They're going to be the world's
first agents that improve the more that you use them. But
there is a question hanging over all of this. And for the
leaders in IT, security and compliance in the room, those
who are held accountable for something when something goes
wrong, how do we empower business teams to innovate but
do it safely and securely? Writer has to be first and
foremost an interoperable platform, one that can observe,
control and connect your agents at scale with the tools and
safeguards you already trust. Today, we're bringing that
paradigm to Writer by launching a powerful suite of supervision
tools built specifically for the enterprise. We're giving
organizations full visibility and control across the agent
lifecycle. Every session tracked every output compliance
and every data connector governed in real time. True
interoperability means connecting to the systems you
trust. So our platform works with the observability.
Observability guardrails and systems that you already use.
And beginning today, we're very systems that you already use.
And beginning today, we're very excited to announce Amazon
Bedrock guardrails now integrate directly with our
platform. That means thank you. That means if you've already
set up your policies and safety rules in Bedrock, you can apply
those exact same guardrails to use and Writer. You don't have
to rebuild anything, and you get one consistent, compliant
layer of control across your entire AI stack. We also know
that model choice is really important to enterprises. So
also starting today, models from Amazon Bedrock are
available directly inside of the Writer platform. That means
AWS and Writer customers can now build agents on Writer
using a catalog of different models. From our own Palmyra
family to the awesome Nova models you just heard about
today, and many more, all within a single governed
environment. It's the ultimate flexibility without
compromising on security. For organizations like Vanguard,
long time customers of Writer and AWS, where trust is
non-negotiable. The Writer and Bedrock integrations give them
the control they need to innovate responsibly at scale.
And trust is how companies go from a few scattered POCs to a
truly governed, enterprise wide, impactful AI strategy. You
can't scale what you don't trust at Writer. Our vision is
to empower people to transform work, and we're very proud to
do it with AWS. Thank you.
