>> Please welcome the vice president of Global Specialists
and partners at AWS. Dr. Ruba Borno.
>> Good afternoon, Las Vegas. Good morning, good afternoon
and good evening. For those of you joining us around the world,
I want to thank you so much for being here and welcome you to
the Partner Advantage keynote. Today. You will witness how AWS
and our partners are driving customer outcomes so
extraordinary. They feel like magic. We will lean into the
tension of what is believable and what isn't. What is
illusion and what is reality. And we will close that gap to
reveal a fundamental truth that magic is simply science we
don't yet understand. Now, our goal today is to shed light on
this science, to give you confidence to think bigger. And
the examples we share today show us just the beginning of
what is possible. You will see how 100 year old company is
redefining their future, and how a healthcare network
unlocked revenue and delivered better patient experiences. At
the same time, we will see an automotive giant integrate
customer experiences and insights into their supply
chain and how to navigate unpredictable environments to
transform a sport for the athletes and fans. And last but
not least, how to use responsible AI as a culture
guardian to protect and preserve the most sacred data
for future generations. Each of these customers have common,
fundamental building blocks that comprise this science
behind the magical outcomes. So let's start with agentic AI, a
revolutionary leap that is defining a new future. A future
where customers and partners are differentiating themselves
with their own data and have the complete confidence to
reimagine their businesses because of a secure foundation.
But imagination is nothing without the right tools, and
that's why we've invested in building the broadest toolkit
in the industry. To reach those extraordinary outcomes, you
need one more ingredient, and that ingredient acts as a
catalyst. The people, the AWS Partner network. Today, agents
and autonomous systems are reshaping how we work and live,
and we together are at the leading edge of this change.
And this isn't incremental change. It is the most
significant technological shift since the internet itself. AWS
and our partners are harnessing the power of this technology to
build a new reality. We're witnessing this science and
action at one of the most prolific media companies in the
world today. Their customer attention was fragmented and so
was their data. Their industry was facing disruption, and they
had to invent a new approach to delivering customer experiences
to millions of people across the globe, known for brands
like Vogue, The New Yorker and Vanity Fair,
Condé Nast has built a media empire over the last 115 years,
and while they had vast data across 22 publications, they
were operating in silos. But with the help of AWS and our
partners, they unified that data to deliver millions of
personalized experiences to humans around the world. Please
welcome the leaders shaping the future of Condé Nast. Chief
Technology Officer, Sanjay Bhakta.
>> Thank you, Ruba and good afternoon, everyone. I'm here
to tell you a story of how 115 year old publishing icon
transformed into a modern digital media powerhouse. As
you saw, Condé Nast owns some of the world's most influential
brands, powered by extraordinary journalism, and
we reach over a billion people globally. When I joined Condé
Nast in January of 2020, we had some digital presence, but our
business was still mostly print. As hard as it is to believe, we
didn't have any HR system and we didn't have a finance system,
and we were facing existential threats from social media
platforms and 15 second long video clips. We operated across
12 markets, 22 plus global brands and nine languages. We
still do. Each market had its own mix of brands,
infrastructure, platforms and product platforms. Our number
one priority at the time was global consolidation. Getting
it to a single content platform on AWS, one single API stack
and one global front end framework powering all of our
brands globally in every market. This gave us a solid foundation
that was global, multi-region and resilient. Our editorial
teams could finally collaborate with each other, and our
content could easily be syndicated across markets and
languages using AI based translation. Our product teams
were able to create reusable capabilities and launch them
globally. But as with every transformation, new challenges
emerged. Our legacy workflows were just weren't built for
real time publishing. We lacked a cohesive data strategy or an
ability to to experiment and a unified view of our customers.
Our four digital business lines often conflicted with each
other, and simple decisions like a paywall became an
emotional argument rather than a data driven decision. Our
data estate back in 2020 was extremely fragmented. We had
multiple data warehouses, no taxonomy, no governance, no
consistent way of extracting insights. So we created a
deliberate AI ready data strategy. Snowplow became our
real time data pipeline for high quality behavioral data.
And Databricks became our central lakehouse due to its
seamless integration with AWS storage, compute, and
activation stack. As we stand today, we have instrumented
every user touchpoint globally, with snowplow unifying all user
behavior data into a single Databricks Lakehouse. This has
created a foundation for accurate modeling, ML feature
generation, and trusted reporting. This stack unlocked
cross-cutting capabilities allowed us to integrate our
customer data platform with Databricks, enabled us to do
sophisticated multivariate testing, and gave us a true 360
degree customer view and an identity spine. In order to
implement your AI strategy. Trust in your data is the most
essential thing. We invested heavily in governance,
semantics, business definitions. Taxonomy, data lineage, and
data quality using Databricks Taxonomy, data lineage, and
data quality using Databricks Unity Catalog. This allowed us
to scale our AI with confidence. This strategy has enabled us to
meet the challenges I mentioned earlier. Real time analytics
for events and live streams became a major part of our
digital shift. Starting from nothing, we built a live
streaming platform in AWS, and we streamed the first live
event, which was the Met Gala of May 2021, right after the
pandemic. Since then, we have streamed hundreds of events on
this platform and you can, as you can see from the Met Gala
we had recently in May 2025, the numbers are absolutely
staggering. We had 54% more engagement than the Grammy
Awards. We had nearly 400% more engagement than the Golden
Globes. And here's the kicker a whopping 522% more engagement
than the Super Bowl. Subscriptions are our second
largest digital revenue stream, and New Yorker is our biggest
subscription brand. Our data strategy enables personalized
subscription flows and sophisticated testing to reduce
friction and increase subscription conversion. This
year, The New Yorker celebrated 100 years, and it also
surpassed a million paid subscribers. There are three
key lessons that we learned on this journey. First, reframe
your legacy as a competitive advantage. Modernize
capabilities while honoring your brand strengths. Second,
take a sequential approach. Organize your data first before
trying to extract insight. Bring AI to your data rather
than trying to take your data to AI. And most importantly,
align every team around one trusted data strategy. Finally,
choose the right partners based on openness, security, and
interoperability. The right partners reduce transformation
time by years. Our business outcomes have also been
extremely remarkable. Despite headwinds affecting publishers,
we have grown our audiences, we have increased loyalty, and we
have dramatically increased time spent on our on our
digital properties, all driven by personalization and a better
user experiences, complemented by our world class journalism.
We have not only created value for our business, we have also
reduced operational costs by over $10 million by
consolidating on AWS and Databricks, we now have 66
digital properties representing 22 plus brands globally unified
on AWS, powered by a powerful data strategy. We have shifted
from being a print centric to a modern digital business.
Decisions are now data driven and not opinion driven, and
workflows that we once thought were impossible are now a
reality. We have flipped our revenue to 70% digital and 30%
print. And now one more thing. We now actually have a global
financial system and a global We now actually have a global
financial system and a global HR system. Based on running
years of running AI and ML models on Databricks and AWS,
we have built an AI powered contracts management and rights
clearance system using AWS Bedrock, SageMaker and
Marketplace tools. This has reduced our rights clearance
workflow from weeks down to minutes. We recently also
deployed an AI powered content moderation system for user
generated content, and that leverages Amazon Nova 2 Pro.
And we are now in the process of vectorizing all of our
content in Databricks, which will allow us to hyper
personalize our user experiences and also make our
content ready for discovery by LLMs in real time. And we are
just getting started. We are looking forward to building
more on AWS AgentCore and Databricks Lake based and
Databricks Agent bricks. Print is what defined us digital
expanded US, and now AI and data has transformed us and
continues to transform us. Thank you.
>> Thank you Sanjay. What an amazing story. And I love the
lessons that he shared and talking about how AI is going
to transform the business in the future. Condé Nast is
redefining how media companies engage with their audiences.
Now. Their solution is delivering data driven and
unique experiences, but their journey also highlights another
critical factor. You heard Sanjay say in today's era,
success requires orchestrating multiple tools and finding the
right partners who can accelerate your transformation.
Competencies like the AI competency we launched last
year, help customers know which partners to work with. Today,
customers can choose from over 300 partners globally who've
earned this validation, and these partners are delivering
monumental gains for customers. By working with these partners,
customers are 30% more likely to deploy AI applications into
production. But not only that, they're also able to move them
into production 25% faster. This is why we invest in
competencies. This is the difference between
experimentation that has the illusion of progress and
transformation that actually delivers results. And the
results are impressive. Let's look at A3Data. They worked
with Mater Dei, a major healthcare platform in Brazil,
and the Brazilian private hospital sector was losing
$1.85 billion each year due to preventable billing errors. And
on top of that, hospitals were waiting up to 200 days to get
paid. This was due to fragmented revenue cycles,
manual processes and reactive fixes. After problems already
happened, A3Data and Mater Dei worked with the AWS GenAI
Innovation Center to build a solution that is built on
Amazon. Bedrock AgentCore. They built 12 autonomous AI agents
across the entire revenue cycle, from contract analysis to
translating those rules into the ERP system to scheduling,
billing and identification. They continuously monitor the
environment. They adapt to changes in contracts, changes
in regulation and operations in real time. And what was the
result? Mater Dei is seeing a 517% return on investment
processes like procedure authorizations that used to
take two business days are now being completed in 40 minutes,
and the most important benefit of getting the revenue cycle
right the first time is that now they can focus on improving
patient care instead of those manual processes. The vice
president I think they're in the House, vice president at
Mater Dei Renata Salvador put it best when she said,
Opportunity. Now. Results like this are why we continue to
expand our specializations, and that's why I'm excited that
we're launching three new agentic AI competency
categories applications, tools and Consulting Services.
Partners with these specializations meet our high
standards for security, reliability, and responsible AI.
We're awarding agentic AI competency partners with 50%
more marketing development funds and a specialization
badge in the AWS Marketplace so customers can find them with
over 100 competencies and specializations to date, we
know that our customers demand depth and subject matter
expertise from their partners. Customers like Toyota Motor
North America face complexity that requires the help of
multiple partners with different expertise. To call
Toyota's operations large would be an understatement. They have
14 manufacturing plants, making tens of millions of cars and
trucks and shipping them to thousands of dealers. With this
scale, you can imagine the vast amounts of data that they log,
but they face the big challenge. Their data was scattered across
more than 30 systems. Manual processes consumed 40% of their
time, and the gap between what customers expected and what
their supply chain could deliver was growing. So they
brought in multiple partners McKinsey, Deloitte and AWS,
each playing a critical and separate role in their journey.
We at AWS provided the Toolkit through Amazon, Bedrock,
SageMaker, AI, and Q. McKinsey connected the strategy and
built an AI powered supply chain solution that broke down
the data silos and integrated customer insights directly into
planning, and Deloitte tackled the technical implementation.
They modernized Toyota's infrastructure and built an AI
system that simulates different scenarios across supply chain
and recommends mitigation strategies. And Toyota realized
$1 billion in business value. They reduced inventory by 60%,
while their e-commerce sales doubled, their people became
more efficient, and manual effort went down by 40%. And
most importantly, their customer satisfaction went up
by 15% because now they can predict customer preferences
with 85% accuracy. So what's next? Toyota has already
identified over 85 supply chain capabilities that could be
augmented with agentic AI. Results like Toyota's are why
it's so important that customers can easily engage
multiple partners, find the right partners, and bring them
together to work on these solutions. And that's why I'm
excited about the availability of the GenAI and data solutions
for industry Track within our business outcomes Xcelerator or
BOX program. Partners in this track receive support from AWS
experts for building a genetic industry. Solutions. They get
go to market support and co-selling incentives. Now. We
launched box in 2024, and since then we've helped over 400
solutions be created, tailored to customer needs in the
industries in which they operate. We've learned what it
takes for partners to make a difference, and we have found
that the best partners all do one thing exceptionally well.
They know how to help customers get value out of their data to
reveal entirely new possibilities. Even in the most
unexpected, unforgiving and uncontrollable places like
surfing in the ocean. In surfing, factors like wave
velocity, weather conditions, and region can vary in an
unpredictable way from second to second. Now, most sports
live within a confined stadium or track, but what happens when
your sports arena is the vast ocean? The ocean's
unpredictability is no longer a barrier. It is an asset. Let's
take a look. >> One of the most important
raw materials in any sport is data.
>> This is easy to capture because there's a predefined
stadium. There's a lot of infrastructure that can capture
analytics. >> But with surfing you do not
have that consistency. They're trying to compete at the
highest level in all these waves, and every one is
different. It's truly man against nature. There are 2 or
300 yards offshore and really challenging conditions. It's
very, very unforgiving. >> So how do we capture all
these insights in an environment that we can't
control? >> This was a monumental
challenge that we met together with AllCloud.
>> The World Surf League brilliantly came up with the
idea of wearables that can track heart rate and biodata,
the duration of their time on the wave, the path that they
took. >> Miles per hour every second,
or collecting about 100 data points. We're doing that for
tens of thousands of waves a year.
>> This is a lot of data that we need to consolidate really
quickly. And with Amazon Bedrock commentators through
natural language and Generative AI can get this information
pretty instantaneously and form it into a story that's
impactful. >> Netsmart. Oh my God.
>> We can truly start to understand why one person's
performance is better than another's. We are here in
service of the surfers, and I can't make the waves better.
But what I can do is collect data and help them understand
how to perform better. It's going to change the future of
the sport. >> These outcomes aren't just
possible for surfing, they're possible for every industry
ready to turn their data into an intelligence layer that
delivers a competitive advantage. But here's what's
great you don't have to wait. At AWS, we're enabling
customers to activate their data from day one, regardless
of where it resides. With this approach, customers can
immediately benefit from AI powered applications while they
evolve their data strategy. And as customers migrate to The
Cloud as they modernize their data, they can unlock even more
powerful outcomes. But they can start now, and we're giving you
the tools to do just that. First up, AWS transform. This
is an AI service designed to help assess, migrate, and
modernize customer workloads. Since it became generally
available earlier this year, customers and partners have
already saved over 800,000 hours of manual effort. They've
analyzed over a billion lines of mainframe code, and they've
saved over 380 developer years of work. This is the kind of
change that feels like discovering a hidden shortcut.
And just this week, we announced AWS Transform Custom
to modernize any code, APIs, frameworks, runtime, and
language translations with agents, and it can be tailored
to your environment. But we're not stopping there. I am
thrilled about the general availability of composability
in AWS transform. With composability, partners can now
integrate their own tools, agents, and Knowledge Bases.
They can build customer workflows and deliver all of
these seamlessly within AWS transform. Already partners
like Pega, Capgemini, and Accenture are building
integrations using their deep industry and domain knowledge.
Look at customers like Western Union who are benefiting from
these integrations. Their retail money order application
needed to deliver real time transactions globally. So they
partnered with Accenture, who used their financial services
industry expertise to build a banking knowledge based agent
with Accenture's agent and AWS transform Composability.
Western Union modernized their system. They analyzed 2.4
million lines of mainframe code, and they achieved A2X increase
in speed. And these results are not unique. They are the
outcome of a deep understanding of what it takes for customers
to turn migration complexity into repeatable science. And we
believe every customer and every partner should be
leveraging AWS transform. If you're a customer working with
one of these partners, you can access these solutions today in
the AWS Transform Console. And if you're a partner, apply in
AWS Partner Central to get started. But we know that
migration challenges aren't just about the
technology and tools. They're actually about people. Process
and change management to bring it all together. And we've
uncovered these roadblocks, and we've codified a winning
approach that we are now extending to our partners. This
February, we launched the Experience Based Acceleration
Certification for partners. Experience Based Acceleration,
or EBA, was developed by the AWS Worldwide Specialist
Organization, working with thousands of customers over
multiple years, including BMW, SAP, Boeing, Samsung, BBC, the
list goes on. And consistently, they've learned what it takes
to take a stalled migration and turn it into a success story.
So today, there are over 70 certified partners worldwide
scaling EBA to customers. Out of all of the tools we make
available to customers and partners, I am really excited
about the ones we've shared, but I'm very excited to talk
about the one that we believe stands out as the most powerful
go to market scaling engine, and that is the AWS Marketplace.
In July of this year, we launched the AWS Agents and
Tools on Marketplace to make it easier for customers to
discover, deploy, integrate and manage thousands of AI
offerings, models and solutions from large companies like
Caylent, Snowflake and IBM, or from the world's most
innovative startups like fireworks, AI, tonic and
LangChain. All driving net new business through the AWS
Marketplace. What we hear consistently from partners is
that AWS Marketplace has become their highest performing,
fastest growing go to market channel with global scale,
localization capabilities, and a large customer base. The AWS
Marketplace expands any partner's reach. It can give
them up to a 4 to 5 x increase in deal size, growing their top
line revenue and at the same time gaining up to 40% net new
customers and business, expanding their customer
relationships. All of these partner results translate
directly into customer impact, because the AWS Marketplace
illuminates the path for customers to find the right
partner. Today, we're seeing individual partners generate
over $1 billion in sales through the AWS Marketplace in
just a calendar year. Today, we're seeing individual
partners generate that, we're seeing individual
partners generate that, including Datadog, who's
crossed $2 billion through the including Datadog, who's
crossed $2 billion through the AWS Marketplace. Snowflake has
crossed $3 billion, and Salesforce, who's also crossed
$3 billion through the AWS Marketplace. One of our most
exciting new integrations is with Salesforce. Together,
we're launching AgentForce 364 AWS, available exclusively in
the AWS Marketplace early next year. This is built on the
Salesforce platform, running entirely on AWS. It provides
access to Foundation Models through Amazon Bedrock. And so
why do customers benefit and why do they trust AgentForce?
There are three key reasons. First and foremost, something
we are all very passionate about. Security. Customer data
never leaves the Salesforce AWS trust boundary. Second is
transparency. The Atlas Reasoning Engine shows
customers exactly how the agents think, plan and take
action. And third accuracy. The prompt builder delivers AI
that's grounded in the customer's own data, so the
responses are actually relevant to their business. Customers
are already love Salesforce on AWS, and now with agent 360
coming to the AWS Marketplace, we're really excited about
customers getting compliant, trusted agents at scale with
streamlined procurement and a faster ROI. It is innovations
like these that are making Salesforce and other companies
lead our Marketplace billionaires. But we want to
see this type of growth for all of our partners, including
startups. It is part of AWS founding philosophy to
democratize access to the best technology in the world,
technology that was once only available to the biggest
companies with the most resources. Startup partners are
seeing their Marketplace sales increase on average 130% year
over year. And when we look at companies like Vanta and Agent
trust platform provider, they've seen private offers on
AWS Marketplace increased by 700% year over year, and many
of them are growing through a product like Lead Motion or Plg.
In fact, today, over 80% of the transaction volume in the AWS
Marketplace is already self-service. A big part of
accelerating conversion rates is making every seller's
listing differentiated and relevant to the customers
they're seeking out. That's why we've built self-service
features that you can take advantage of, like free trials,
self-service demos and private offers and rich media uploads
to bring your solution to life. Self-service is growing, but we
also know that many customers still prefer to buy through
private offers. So just as Amazon has transformed the
retail shopping experience and made it simple, we're bringing
that same DNA to IT procurement in the AWS Marketplace. We're
taking what we do best building world class marketplaces and
applying it to how businesses discover, purchase and deploy
Cloud solutions. So that's why I'm happy to share that.
Express Private offers are now generally available. Sellers
can offer flexible pricing. Thank you. Sellers can now
offer flexible pricing at scale, align to define rates and
parameters, and then focus their sales teams on more
strategic deals, the ones that require more time. But let's
keep going. Throughout the examples we've shared, we've
seen that the most difficult customer problems need multiple
partners, multiple products, and multiple services. Well,
we've taken our obsession with simplicity further. That's why
I'm excited about this week's launch of multi-product
solutions in the AWS Marketplace. Now, customers
have the ability to procure end to end solutions. These
solutions bring together multiple software products,
including SaaS and agents, as well as professional services
from different partners, all in one package. Customers work
with a single lead seller. They purchase the solution through a
unified flow. They maintain the flexibility to manage the terms
for each solution component, and for the first time,
customers can now find and buy curated, comprehensive
solutions that include both partner and AWS first party
services together. For example, Deloitte works
with AWS and put together a package built on Amazon Connect.
They used enhanced AWS AI capabilities and they created
TrueServe, an intelligent self-service contact center
option for automotive and insurance services. Working
with Amazon QuickSight, integrations with box and other
ISVs help enhance customer productivity by unlocking the
ability for quick to orchestrate agents. Now, I've
just talked about a lot of launches and capabilities, but
I don't want to just talk about them. I want you to see them.
So let's bring these launches to life with our vice President
of Marketplace and Partner Services and our resident
magician, Matt Yanchyshyn. >> First, let me show you how
we're revolutionizing custom deals with AI KMS CISO. And I'm
ready to buy a security solution. I know what I want
and how much I need, even though it's a smaller purchase.
What stands between me and buying the solution is a bunch
of phone calls and emails to negotiate the terms, and this
could take weeks. This solution supports our recent launch,
Express Private Offers. It leverages AI to deliver custom
pricing to customers automatically. So let's start
an express request. I answer a few simple questions like how
much I want to buy, how long I'll need it, what I'll use it
for, and I enter some company information. When I'm done, I
click generate my offer and just like that, I receive a
personalized quote with custom pricing all at the speed of
self-service. Based on the information I shared, AI
qualified me against the seller's criteria and rate
cards automatically and issued me a 15% discount. We're the
only leading Cloud Marketplace to use AI to deliver
personalized pricing to customers in minutes. This is a
game changer for customers and all partners. Whether you're a
large enterprise handling thousands of requests, or a
small partner looking to compete more effectively, you
can close more deals faster and reduce operational overhead.
But there are a lot of times that customers know the problem
they have, but they don't exactly know what they need. So
for our second example, CSAM a CIO looking for a zero trust
solution. I can now use Agent Mode, the new conversational
discovery experience that we just launched. I can access the
new experience on the AWS Marketplace website, or through
an AI application that I've connected to the publicly
available NCP server. So let's start on the website. I'll
describe my use case to create a project. I can upload my
business needs and test specifications, and this could
be like a formal RFP or tech specs document, or just a
simple list. AWS Marketplace securely processes what I've
shared and stores it in a secure, isolated environment
until I delete the project or the project expires. Behind the
scenes, agent Mode searches over 30,000 solutions on the
AWS Marketplace to find the most relevant options. It uses
multiple AI solutions like Anthropic, Claude, and Amazon
Nova. Web grounding all through Amazon Bedrock Nova. Web
grounding is kind of like an intelligent research assistant.
It breaks down my requirements and coordinates multiple
specialized agents to evaluate solutions. And once it's done,
I'm presented with three solutions and an AI generated
summary explaining their relevance to my use case. Next,
I can dive deeper into the options with in-depth
comparisons. An agent provides me with comparisons that are
tailored to my needs. It uses AWS data, verified vendor
information, real time insights from the web to personalize the
comparison to the requirements that I've shared. Looking at
these solutions as a CIO, I think I need to know more about
the security capabilities. So to get this information, I just
type my additional request for security capabilities into the
sidebar. And just like that, a comparison table automatically
adds a new box with details for data protection. We are the
only leading Cloud Marketplace offering a dynamic solution.
Comparisons personalized just for you. From here, I can
generate a purchase proposal to share with my internal
stakeholders that's tailored to my needs and based on my
requirements. I see that Presidio's solution really
stands out, particularly the natural language policy
management and the MCP server inspection provided by Zscaler.
So let's navigate to the solution page to learn more.
Ruba just mentioned multi-product solutions. Here's
what it looks like in action. This is a comprehensive
security solution that combines Zscaler Zero Trust Solution and
MCP server with Presidio's expert implementation services.
So if I look at my use cases, I can see how this solution
addresses my challenge. It connects users directly to
authorized applications instead of entire networks. This is
exactly what I need to streamline secure user access.
As I move down the page, I can see that Presidio solution
includes multiple products and services, and it helps me
understand how they work together. We just launched
variable payments for Marketplace Professional
Services so Presidio can invoice me based on outcomes,
on time and materials on project milestones, giving me
the flexible payment options that align with my
implementation journey. I can click on any of the solutions
to learn more or read their reviews. Now that I understand
the solution and its components, I'll request custom pricing
through a Private Offer. Next, let's look at
how we simplified the procurement process. I've
received a Private Offer for the solution in AWS Marketplace.
Instead of managing multiple purchasing processes with
multiple vendors, I can now negotiate the solution with one
partner, Presidio. We know that doing business globally is
complex. From navigating international tax compliance to
managing multiple currencies. That's why I'm excited to share
that we've expanded our localization support. Let's say
I'm a French customer and I want to pay in euros. I can
let's say I'm a Japanese customer and I want to pay in
yen. I can. This isn't just currency conversion and
translation. We provide true local invoicing. This means
local bank support, end to end local currency support, and
region specific tax treatments. You can even download an offer
for one of the solution components in your own language,
and send it to your finance team for approval. Everything
is handled automatically. This makes global procurement easier.
Who all that's left is to complete the purchase by
reviewing each offer and clicking Accept Offer set. But
we all know it doesn't stop at just subscription. That's why
AWS Marketplace helps quickly deploy solutions. In this case,
I can deploy the Zscaler MCP server for this multi-product
solution that I just purchased directly to Amazon Bedrock
AgentCore. In just a few clicks, I can launch the Zscaler Agent
tool on AgentCore Runtime, which provides a secure
serverless hosting environment for deploying and running AI
agents. Thanks to our integration with AgentCore, you
no longer have to manage deployments yourself. You can
also integrate with your remote MCP server API based product
with anything with an open API specification directly into
AgentCore gateway from AWS Marketplace. And finally, I
have the flexibility to manage each component of the solution
independently, all in the AWS Marketplace console. So let's
take a step back and just think about what we what we just
accomplished. We received custom pricing without needing
to contact the seller with Express Private Offers. We used
AI to analyze my requirements to identify three solutions
that match my needs. We evaluated my options with
dynamic comparisons. Using agent Mode. We purchased a
multi-product solution with components from multiple
vendors. In one purchasing flow. We seamlessly handle
procurement across international boundaries, and
then we deployed the agent tool into Amazon. Bedrock AgentCore.
I mean, what other Marketplace allows you to do all of that?
For partners? This is your opportunity to package
expertise and technology to address specific customer needs.
You can close more deals even faster. So what are you waiting
for? Some of our most innovative partners, including
Deloitte Okta, Accenture Elastic, have already built
multi-product solutions in the AWS Marketplace. In fact, we
have over 60 cutting edge AWS Marketplace. In fact, we
have over 60 cutting edge solutions available today, and
the early adopters are gaining a significant competitive
advantage. So don't get left behind. Customers start
exploring these solutions at AWS Marketplace and partners
start packaging solutions. Today we're building the future
of solution delivery right here in AWS Marketplace. Thank you.
Back to you, Ruba. >> All right. You can see the
team has been busy. And you can also see that they're
passionate about driving a simple and secure experience
for our customers and partners. And one of the ways that we're
doing that is by providing a security strategy that
integrates partners seamlessly, partners like CrowdStrike. I'm
excited about the launch of automated discovery and
deployment for the CrowdStrike Falcon next gen SIM. This
solution makes it easier to provision AWS resources across
multiple accounts and multi-region environments. It
integrates with AWS Security services so customers can
manage their security operations all in one place.
Using Crowdstrike's AI investigator and Amazon,
EventBridge customers get near real time ingestion of security
findings, threat detection and remediation. We're also
introducing a pay as you go pricing option for customers,
so they can start protecting their environments right away
and scale with their needs. And CrowdStrike is one of our
billionaires that's crossed $1 billion on AWS Marketplace. Now
we are not stopping there in terms of simplifying the
security experience. Last month, we launched the AWS Identity
and Access Management Temporary Delegation. Now, with this
feature, customers can safely delegate to partners to perform
initial deployments, maintenance or upgrades on
their behalf. Think about that. This reduces setup time, it
reduces operational overhead, and it keeps customers in
complete control. Since then, we've already seen partners
like Vercel, Databricks, Sentinel one, and others use
this feature to build better onboarding experiences for
customers, putting them in control. And this control is
more important than ever in the Agentic era. One of the
exciting things about agents is that they work in a
non-deterministic way, but that means you need a new security
foundation, one that is purpose built for this nature of agents.
That's where Amazon Bedrock AgentCore is redefining the
future of security in the Agentic era. It is the most
advanced agentic platform to build, deploy and operate
agents securely at scale. So with AgentCore, customers and
partners have built in protection for every agent they
create. And I want to take a closer look at a few of these
capabilities and what they mean for you. First, you need to
know that your agents are isolated. That's where
AgentCore Runtime comes in. Each session runs in its own
dedicated MicroVM separate CPU, memory, and file system, while
running sessions are completely separated. Helping to safeguard
against reasoning leaks or cross session data
contamination. And once a session ends, everything is
sanitized, clean and secure. AWS partner Genpact is using
AgentCore Runtime to enable Apex Fintech Solutions. They've
created isolated execution environments for specialized
agents. Those agents have processed 1.8 million daily
trades across millions of brokerage accounts, reducing
false positives and improving case resolution time. And by
improving the investigative efficiency, they've delivered
better operational oversight, protecting those millions of
brokerage accounts. Second is AgentCore Observability, which
provides the ability to follow your agents actions, their
reasoning steps, their tool calls, their model interactions.
And because it is open telemetry compatible, it works
seamlessly with our partners observability solutions
partners like Tracey, Dynatrace, and Langfuse, and so on, giving
customers and partners the ability to integrate into the
tools they already rely on. And last but not least, think of
agents as users of your systems. Just like people, each one
needs to be authenticated and authorized in a deliberate
manner. And that's where AgentCore Identity comes in.
You get seamless identity and access management across AWS
services and third party applications like Slack and
Zoom in just a few lines of code. And it integrates with
your existing identity provider, whether it's Okta, enter ID or
Amazon Cognito. And that is why we aim for AWS to be the most
secure place to build agents for your innovations. And now,
it is my great pleasure to introduce someone who is very
passionate about security, and even more passionate about your
ability to build AWS. CEO Matt Garman. All right Matt, I love
it. Second year in a row, you're wearing a jacket for the
partners. >> I did the thing.
>> Awesome. >> I get dressed up for you
guys. >> Well, it's also your second
year as CEO here, so thank you very much for for joining us.
And how's re:Invent been for you so far?
>> Fantastic. It's it's every year I come and it is I know it.
And then I come here and just the energy in the halls is, is
awesome. And the my my favorite part actually is hearing
customers and partners learning from each other, talking to
each other. Part of my favorite part is for all of you that
this week is also your best week of the year and your
biggest week of the year to get to talk to customers and super
exciting! So thank you all for all you do and thank you for
all being here. >> All right. Well we've got
one more applause generating slide before we get into the
talk track. And I know you usually congratulate our
partner award winners. >> Oh, yes. Sorry. That was for
me. So congratulations to all of our partner award winners.
We really appreciate you in all of the areas that you do.
Actually we appreciate all the partners. But in particular,
congratulations to the award winners. You guys had a
fantastic year. Thank you very much.
>> All right. All right. So Matt, you've been with AWS
since the beginning. I think you wrote the first business
plan and you've seen a massive technological shift. Obviously
now we're entering a completely different shift here with this
era. And I want to double click specifically on partners. What
is your vision for how AWS partners can succeed in this
era and drive innovation for our customers?
>> Yeah, it's an incredible opportunity. And as you all
know, from from the time that we started AWS, we new partners
are critical to our customer success and to your customer
success. And I think now more than ever, our joint customers
need you all. It is a time of incredible change. Technology
has never moved as fast as it's moving right now. And when you
go talk to the enterprises out there in the hall, they are
looking for guidance. They're looking for help. They're
looking for someone that can get them to where they need to
be. They know that the this technology is transformative.
They know that their industries are changing, their business is
changing, and they need help to get there. They need help
thinking about the organizational structure. They
need software that's going to help them get there. They need
technical advice on how to get there. And you all know their
businesses better than anyone. And and you hopefully know the
AWS technologies better than anyone. And combining those two
I think is is a really powerful solution to help customers
really get the value out of AI that they're all hoping to.
>> And Matt, you had some key announcements in your keynote.
One of them was about AI factories and what we're doing
with NVIDIA and partners like HUMAIN. And what role do you
see these partners playing in things like that?
>> I think across all of the announcements that we that we
did and we'll do this week, you all are a critical component of
that. If you think something like an AI factory think about
AI factories, is is taking advantage of very large
customers that have existing data centers and a data center
and power footprint that they want to kind of land. Think
about it as like, you know, outposts on steroids kind of a
thing. It's like really a a big AI implementation and a
customer data center. That's a place where you can help. If
you think about agents, customers all think that they
are going to completely redo how their software works inside,
how their processes work inside, how everything that they do
works inside. They need your help to do that. A number of
the things that we've launched and from a technology partner
point of view, we have an incredible ecosystem of
technology partners. You mentioned NVIDIA as one of them,
but all the things that we come to offer together to AWS, we
don't we can't build all of them. We build some of them,
but not all of them. And our partners are a big part of what
we deliver. >> So I want to touch on
something that you mentioned in your keynote that Swami talked
about in his keynote, which is Customers Transforming, and
it's gone from the age of a bunch of pilots to really
trying to get value out of production. And so you've got a
unique, you know, vantage point here, speaking with thousands
and thousands of customers on how this market is evolving.
And I'd love to just hear from you. What should partners do to
prepare themselves to help customers actually take
advantage of this? >> Yeah. And what I'll say is
we've all kind of kind of seen this transition. I would say
two years ago, even a year ago. Still customers were in the
proof of concept stage. They were trying to figure out how
they really get to production. You talk to every customer now.
They are not in that proof of concept stage. They they don't
necessarily know exactly how they're going to get into
production. They don't know how they're going to drive the
value, but they're starting to see those workloads. And those
are the workloads that are landing on AWS. Right. Proof of
concepts might have launched lots of places or wherever they
tried to launch them. But when customers actually get to where
do I want my production workloads to be? They want them
where their application is running, they want them where
their data is running, and they are landing those on AWS, and
they need your help to do that. I was just at the in a room
full of, of enterprises earlier, and I asked them to raise their
hands as to which of you think that you're going to see
positive ROI from your AI investments in the next six
months. And I would say 80% of the hands went up, like people
are really seeing. This is no longer an experiment. This is
not something I'm doing because my board asked me to look at AI.
This is real value that they're going to get for their business.
It's going to drive revenue. It's going to drive cost down.
People are seeing it. And and the opportunity is really there.
>> And I think a lot of our partners are applying it for
their own business models as well, you know, consulting
partners, ISVs and so on, how they're transforming their
businesses. What are you seeing there?
>> Yeah, you absolutely have to do that because look, the the
transformation that's coming when I say it, it's going to
affect every single job and every single industry that
includes all of your jobs and all of your industries as well,
and ours as well. Like, we all have to be thinking about this.
We have to think about how we're delivering solutions
differently. We have to think about how we're building
software differently. We have to think about all of those
pieces. And so if each and every one of you is not
thinking about your company as how it's transforming, you're
going to have a hard time helping and credibly talking to
our customers and tell them how to transform. And so it's it
really is thinking about that disruption is coming and
there's enormous opportunity, by the way, for you all to to
double your business to to cut costs and to deliver more for
customers. But you've got to take it just as seriously as we
tell all of our customers. We have to be taking it. And when
we think about internally the Amazon, that's exactly what we
do. We go and push on our teams and say, how are you going to
deliver 30% more without adding resources? How are you thinking
about delivering double the amount that you did on your
roadmap last year that you're going to do this year? How are
you thinking about completely changing how you go to market,
how you help customers? We're doing that. You all need to be
doing that too. >> So speaking of massive
opportunity, I know AWS and in the last Amazon earnings call,
we talked about making a massive infrastructure
investment. I just wanted to ask, you know, from your
perspective, why is AWS making these investments and what do
you think that means for partners?
>> Yeah, it is just this look, you don't often get such a
massive opportunity to go after a space like Cloud computing is
right now. And we're you know, I often talk to our teams about
the opportunity that we have in AWS. AWS, in a relatively short
amount of time, has grown to be $132 billion business. That is
a very large business, but we're still growing at 20% year
over year. And that growth rate is accelerating. That means
we're thinking about how do we become a $300 billion business,
a $400 billion business. And when you go to and that's the
opportunity size, that's all in front of us and in front of all
of you, because the amount of business that you run on top of
that is many, multiple of times bigger than that. And so when
you think of that opportunity, that's a massive amount of
capital investment. It's a massive amount of opportunity.
And that's what we're excited about. It takes investment to
get there, but the opportunity is really significant. And and
I am convinced that we're at the very earliest stages of
what the demand is going to look like for this business.
>> Yeah. And speaking of the the opportunity for partners,
you know, we commissioned a study recently completely third
party. But for every dollar of AWS services that a partner is
deploying at a customer, they're realizing $7.13 from
that, which. >> Is that's pretty awesome.
That means if we're going to go build a $400 billion business,
that's something like $2 trillion, $3 trillion business
for all of you. That is a massive opportunity. And we all
have to go after and grab it. >> Awesome. Well, thank you so
much, Matt. I know we've only got you for a short period of
time here, but I want you to give any last words you've got
for the partner community. >> No, I think mostly I'll
start just one more time with a thank you. I say this, but I
really mean it. Our business would not be what it is without
all of you. Our customers would not be on that same
transformation journey without all of you. And so part of that
excitement that is out there in the halls and that you hear
from everybody here is due to you. And so thank you. It's
that thriving ecosystem that's incredibly impactful. And I
really do believe that we are at such an inflection point of
technology where change is going to be significant, and
it's a any time there's change, there's risk of disruption, but
there's huge opportunities out there and really looking
forward to going after it with all of you. So thank you so
much for everything you do. >> Thank you so much, Matt.
>> Thank you. >> That was recently quoted in
an article where he said partners are the lifeblood of
AWS business. And we absolutely believe that every year we
gather in Las Vegas to celebrate the astonishing speed
of technological advancement, we constantly think about what
to disrupt next. We're fixated on the future. But what if the
next innovation is safeguarding a 40,000 year old legacy? What
if our collective ingenuity is to protect stories, records,
traditions, and the sovereignty of generations who came before
us? For the Ngāpuhi, technology can act as a guardian or a
kaitiaki of indigenous knowledge derived from their
values. Kiwa Digital and custom challenge us to rethink how we
develop and deploy AI, setting a new standard for responsible
innovation. Let's take a look. >> I descend from the Ngāpuhi
tribe and also the Ngāti Pakahi Ngāti Rēhia subtribes. The
mission here is to help bridge cultural divides, help
indigenous groups preserve their knowledge and Amplify the
indigenous voice using technology, culture. It's an AI
powered platform that's designed to help indigenous
groups collect, preserve and share their cultural data and
narrative. Through the AWS Partner network, we're able to
leverage custom RDS expertise and Generative AI.
>> And Caitlin talk to each other. Caitlin is an ethical
and private AI system. We like to call it Kaitiaki a guardian.
That only looks at the knowledge base these
communities are building themselves.
>> At the heart of this is data sovereignty. Many indigenous
groups require local residency to uphold the law, the customs
and control the local AWS regions, reduce our risk, grow
confidence and most importantly, allow us to gain the trust.
>> Knowledge is power. Holding your own knowledge and being
able to empower your people with it. Being able to tell the
stories the way that you want to.
>> What we're doing now, looking at the future with AI
and culture, we're continuing that Mahi. We're continuing
that navigation into the future. It's building a great
foundation for all the kids. It's enabling them to have all
these tools and have all of our knowledge in one place, so that
they can be empowered to make really bold decisions in the
future. >> Lila.
>> The solution. >> Started with the Māori Data
Lens, a framework that embedded their values directly into the
solution from the beginning. This ensured a respect for
ancestral ancestral sovereignty requirements, and it led to
Zero Trust Security, customer managed encryption keys and
guardrails that automatically identify and protect that
sacred content based on that community's defined rules, all
built to honor and preserve knowledge, culture, and history
for generations to come. The lesson is clear weather
transforming supply chains and customer experiences,
reimagining a sport or preserving cultural heritage.
Successful AI starts with modern infrastructure, ready to
use data and enterprise grade security, all with AWS and our
partners, we're solving problems so unique, yet so
revolutionary that I am amazed every single day. What we
accomplish often feels like magic. But here's the truth
what we call magic is really just science. Science that
gives you confidence to transform your business today
so you can discover a better future. You push boundaries,
distill imagination into tangible form, and make what
once seemed impossible entirely achievable. We started off with
an Arthur C Clarke quote that any sufficiently advanced
technology is indistinguishable from magic. What we share today
shows that magic isn't mythical. It is methodical. But magic
only works when it surprises us, when it shocks us, and when it
inspires all that means we can't settle on successes we
see today. Yesterday's innovations are no longer
enough. And that is why at AWS we invent so you can re:Invent.
I want to thank the team that helped put this on. Thank you for
the partnership. And have a great rest 
of your week.
