summary: "In the session \"Customer Story: AI Adoption with Salesforce & Amazon Bedrock\" (AIM267), Shibani Ahuja (Salesforce) and Samir (Capital, formerly AWS) present a compelling narrative on the evolution of enterprise AI strategies. Shibani, reflecting on her 520+ meetings with global CIOs over the past year, outlines the shifting sentiment. Initially, the market was dominated by a \"DIY\" mentality where CIOs insisted on building their own AI stacks from scratch. This quickly gave way to a \"SaaS\" phase, and has now matured into the \"Agentic Native\" era. She uses the metaphor of \"Wolverine’s adamantium skeleton\" to describe agentic architecture—it is incredibly powerful but excruciatingly difficult to engineer from the ground up. Consequently, CIOs are now favoring established platforms like Salesforce and AWS that provide these complex agentic frameworks out-of-the-box, allowing organizations to focus on application logic rather than plumbing. Samir takes the stage to share the practical implementation at Capita, the UK’s largest business process outsourcer (BPO). Capita’s scale is massive, interacting with 70% of the UK population through services ranging from army recruitment to pension administration. Facing the challenge of modernizing without \"ripping and replacing\" their fragmented landscape of 65+ legacy applications, Capita adopted a strategy of \"Agentic Over-the-Top\" architecture. Using MuleSoft to wrap legacy systems and Salesforce Agentforce combined with Amazon Bedrock, they have rapidly deployed agents across 44 distinct use cases. One standout example is their contact center transformation. Samir debunks the myth that AI is purely a cost-cutting tool for reducing headcount. Instead, he reports that after an initial pilot with 10 agents, the remaining 1,000+ human advisors actively petitioned for access to the tools. By offloading drudgery—like real-time transcription and summary generation—to AI agents, employee satisfaction scores skyrocketed, directly correlating with improved customer Net Promoter Scores (NPS). The technical synergy between Salesforce and AWS is a focal point. Samir explains that Capita leverages Salesforce as the \"system of engagement\" and low-code builder, while relying on AWS Bedrock for \"model optionality\" and secure infrastructure. This allows them to choose the right model for the right task without vendor lock-in, all while retiring their AWS committed spend. He shares a striking anecdote where a Systems Integrator (SI) quoted £2 million and months of work to build a specific solution. Using the low-code capabilities of Agentforce and Bedrock, Samir claims he prototyped the same functionality himself in just 30 minutes. This democratization of development has emboldened Capita to empower its non-technical employees to become \"Jedi Knights,\" building their own agents to solve hyper-local problems. The session concludes with a strong endorsement of the \"Platform Strategy.\" In a market flooded with ephemeral AI startups, Samir advises building on \"infrastructure that won't change\"—specifically the AWS and Salesforce ecosystems. By doing so, enterprises can weather the uncertainty of the AI boom, avoid technical debt, and deliver \"local government in a box\" or \"24/7 contact centers\" at a fraction of the historical cost and time."

Uh, my name's Shimani Hooja. I'm gonna say a couple words. I'll share a few slides now that they're working. Excellent. And then I'd love to introduce a friend of mine, Samir, but I'd like to make fun of him, uh, before we start. The last time he and I were on stage together, I was in 4 inch stilettos and like a, an evening gown, and he was dressed like a scrub, so he's giving me a hard time that I dressed for my audience. I came prepared. I've worn my big data energy hat. Next time, Samir, know your audience, OK? Um, so I'm Shibani Ahuja. I have been, uh, at Salesforce for one year. November 18th marked my one year anniversary. Before being at Salesforce, I was sitting in your seat, so I worked at, uh, TD Bank. It's one of the largest banks in Canada. I, I headed up their digital, um, digital banking for a little while, and I ran a number of their technologies, uh, across the globe. And um how I ended up in the role that I'm in is Salesforce loves to tell customer success stories, so they invited me to an internal conference of just their employees in a room for about 450,450 people. Mark Benioff was sitting where you are, and they're asking me about the personalization at scale and all this, all these things that we did. At the end, he asked me one question. What advice, you know, Mark Benioff is sitting right here. What advice do you have for the company? And I let it rip. Like I made it stand-up comedy. I was on a roll that I couldn't even stop making fun of the company, and I, I, I would say things like, you know, it's ironic that you're helping me put my customer at the center. Yet when I show up for a meeting with you, 22 of you show up, and I just went on and on and on. Next thing you know, I'm, I'm sure I'm gonna get kicked out, and the next thing you know, um, as I'm walking out, someone says, Watch out, they're coming for you. And so now I am on the salesforce side and I have one of the coolest jobs where I ultimately I'm helping the company build out our go to market strategy for how we engage CIOs in the office of the CIO and CEOs and CFOs and CEOs, so all the C-suite what that translates into is I actually get to just travel the world and I meet with enterprise, uh. CIOs of all industries, all shapes and sizes, uh, I've, I just got my latest count. I've hit now 4 520 CIOs in the course of a year, and these are meaningful engagements. Why I share this is because it comes into a couple of the trends and patterns that I've observed as it relates to this little thing called AI over the course of the year. Before I get into sharing any of those, I, I've been obligated by my legal team to share a love letter with you. So this is the love letter from my legal team to say please make any purchasing decisions that you, uh, that you are going to make on generally available products today, not of anything that you might see that's future looking, so. 520 CIOs I've gone through and seen a lot of trends. One of which is the fact that AI has become the smallest, biggest word. It's become the fastest growing thing that everyone needs to implement. They have to rush to get something into production. And CIOs are in a hot seat right now where unlike cloud or mobile or internet where they were squarely in the driver's seat and they were doing it like implementing it on behalf of their organizations, suddenly everyone with chat GPT has become an expert at AI. Boards are putting pressure, CEOs are putting pressure. Everyone is putting all this pressure on CIOs to get something implemented. And what's happened is in the early, early stages of the year, CIOs were, were, were, you know, Salesforce as an organization would come in and you would see these CIOs that say, no, no, no, I'm gonna build shop. I'm gonna build my own. And why I say AI AI is the smallest, biggest word is because I was starting to learn the differences between predictive versus generative versus agentic architecture, but the CIOs would just say, no, no, no, I'm gonna build my own. And it would surprise me to say like, you really wanna build the component parts for agentic architecture and do you actually fundamentally understand what agentic AI is, what the difference is between a co-pilot or generative and agentic, and so it was adamantly this conversation, I'm gonna, it's build versus buy. I'm gonna DIY. I think as, as, as CIOs, uh, started to and, and tech leaders started to understand, no, there is actually a fundamental difference between generative, uh, and a generative and agentic, then the conversation shifted again and the conversation started to shift a bit more to, well, maybe not build versus buy, but I'm gonna start to look at maybe platforms like a SAS platform. Um, that's gonna allow me to move with speed, and they're gonna, they're gonna have templates and I can do it really quickly. And, you know, a lot of my like customer data is already within Salesforce, so let me leverage that because it seems to be a good smart place to be. There'd be others that would have a different approach and they might say, well, no, I'm, I like, I'm not gonna look at Salesforce for AI. They're my CRM company. There's others that would say, I'm gonna go to the Amazons of the world. I'm gonna go to AAWS. I want a cloud service provider. They're gonna give me infinite scale and up time, and I'm gonna have governance, um, and protection and security. I'm gonna be able to build my own customized agents. And it was again, I saw the debate shifting from DIY to not, to build versus buy to now this one to say, no, I'm gonna do a SAS provider and I'm gonna do. There's a world where both exist, and that's what we're gonna share about today is, I think now the latest iteration, and it's about a month and a half that I've started to hear more and more of this, less to build or buy, less it's gonna be a SAS platform or I'm gonna use a cloud service provider. Now it has shifted to agentic native agentic integration. Uh, at, at TD my Martech stack alone was 90 technologies. I couldn't imagine ripping all of that out and starting fresh because uh they, I've got a 4 year old at home, so I describe agentic architecture as like the steel or the metal in Wolverine's body. I'm not, uh, no one's gonna architect that from scratch. That's pretty tough to do. And so now you, I'm hearing a lot of CIOs say I need to look at the partners that I've already invested in, the technologies that I already have in my shop, and I'd like to start looking at who is doing the work for me to build these agentic native integrations such that we can move with speed, and that is the better together story because I think that there has been, wait, Salesforce, don't you compete with AWS in certain spaces, but that's not the case. So I am so thrilled to introduce Samir from Capita, who, uh, again a friend of mine. Come on up, come on, nice to see you again. We are friends. We are, we are, we are legitimately friends, so I can tease him, um, and Capita has become an agentic enterprise where leveraging Salesforce and Amazon Bedrock. He is an example of how we have come together to really be able to drive agents at scale. And Samir, when we were prepping for this, one of the things that you had, um, talked about was that you've got 44 use cases specifically that you're looking at that are linked to both Amazon Bedrock and Agent Force. Tell us a bit about those 4 use cases. Yeah, first of all, absolutely thrilled to be back at Reinvent. I was at AWS until exactly this day a year ago. So it's great to come back as a customer. You actually walk less, believe it or not, as a customer. So, uh, absolutely thrilled, and I've seen what Salesforce has done with AWS in the past, from the inside, and now I see it from the outside as well. And so when I took on this new role to, uh, introduce agentic workflows into Capita, there was a lot of noise about which platform to use. Who do we engage with? Do we go with an SI? And, and, and there were these, and the fundamental thing that. Jeff Jeff Bezos actually said was, in times of uncertainty, build on something that doesn't change. And I know what won't change. AWS will be here. Salesforce will be here. And so when I looked at what we needed to build across the multiple use cases we have, and we run everything from Transport for London to training nuclear submarine operators. The, my, my biggest need was to democratize the ability to build agents across all of my organization. And so we looked at 44 different use cases to get started. The first one is we had, as, as Shubani mentioned, she said 90. I have a customer who's got 65 right now, different applications, and you could either rip and replace, or you could go over the top with MuleSoft and create that cover and then start building agents on top very, very easily, and that's one that we use all the time. And then for our contact center space, the integration with Amazon Connect and that exposure into Agent Force, we're actually building agents, voice agents in Agent Force today and deploying them at scale using both Amazon Connect in VoiceCloud and Salesforce. Uh, we're using Mission Force for our defense applications. We're building local government in a box. And all of these that used to take years and frankly tens of millions of pounds to build, we're now building in months and deploying at scale. And, and you know, for the audience that may or may not be familiar with Capita, maybe give even like a brief overview of like what Capita is, what's the business that you're in. So Capita is the largest UK based public sector BPO, business process outsourcer. So if you really look at the kind of services we operate, we touch 70% of the UK's population every single week, from running civil service pensions, which we went live with 2 days ago. To Transport for London, which I mentioned, to doing recruitment for the British Army, and everywhere, it is such a diverse, Use case that is very, very. Um, process heavy. And, and that's ripe for identification, and that's why we're there because human labor is going to go infinite. It is going to be scalable. It is going to be available 24/7, and that's the mission that we're after. So Samir, here's another connect that we have like BPO. I used to live in the Philippines and I was setting up a captive BPO. It is a human intensive function or department. Like how are you looking at, we've talked a lot about agents, human agents and digital labor coming together. Like, how are you looking at that strategy being a very, like human-heavy organization? What's the strategy of bringing AI and your colleagues together? In, in, in, in the, in the immortal words of a guy called Phil, just do it. So there's a lot of fud in the market about agentification that it's gonna take jobs, reduce labor. We saw exactly the opposite when we introduced agents to our customer advisors who actually run that contact center. If you, if you've ever been on a contact center and you've been passed around department to department, we all have, right? for hours and hours, you're super frustrated, but guess who's more frustrated than you? It's actually the customer advisor on the other end, because he or she did not have the tools to actually resolve your problem. Once we gave our advisors those tools, they actually started pulling on us and giving us more use cases for identification. And that started this virtuous cycle where when we started with 10 advisors, all 1,000+ advisors actually literally came to us and said, I want some of that. Because they do not want to be writing up transcripts. They do not want to be marking their marking themselves. They don't want the supervisor looking over their shoulder. It's just a better life. They they're more satisfied. They're happier, and that's translating into uh customer NPS improvements for our contact centers. On, on that and the, the, the use cases that you've talked about, how are you measuring? So measurement, true measurement was a hot topic last night. I hosted a dinner with CIOs, and one of the hottest topics that came up was, yep, we're attributing a lot of benefits to AI, but tracing it back was very difficult because many organizations didn't have the baseline. How are you looking at the measurement of AI and are you telling the story? Yeah, so, so, so three different vectors really. One, we run a lot of contracts that have KPIs. And when we don't execute to those KPIs, we incur penalties, but when we exceed those KPIs, we share in the profits with the customer. So actually looking at that KPI and saying, hey, can we eliminate all of these penalties, we've eliminated double digit million pounds of penalties in a contract just by identifying the bottleneck. And that drops straight to the bottom line. It's not new revenue, but it's even better because it's a 100% margin, right? And we share that with the customer. And then number 2, we are embedding AI into every single bid that we put out there, every single one. And we are seeing a win rate increase because we are cheaper, we are faster. And we're more flexible in what we're providing to the customer. So that's number 2. And then number 3, just for us to become an agentic enterprise, uh, we are, we have democratized access to low code development of agents across all of our cuss all of, all of our employees, and we're actually measuring what they, what, what, what, what, what agents they've built and what actions they're taking. And at this point we are attributing a fiat currency to each one of them. But the customer and the employee NPS, sorry, is actually a good representation of how well they're actually adopting it and how happy they are with it, and it is going up. What I, so again, if I think about the the trends and evolution that I've seen as it relates to AI, I love what you've just called out, is that not one of your measurements was how many FTEs are you reducing? None at all. Right. Like this is again a healthy way of starting to think about those use cases and looking at the growth opportunities or the expansion opportunities. I had actually it was, it was also per capita, I think that I was, uh, presenting and speaking on your behalf saying that there was a contact center opportunity that you had a use case where your contact center was open 9 to 5 and suddenly when you implemented agent force to help support the contact center agent. Such that the agent could handle the more like mundane tasks, suddenly your contact center become from 9 to 5 became overnight. It was 24/7 because there was transactions that could be performed or there was, uh, cases that could be resolved by the agent and that's again another way of looking at it to say that's a reverse benefit to your colleagues, uh, the change management around adoption. Yeah, that's, that's a great use case, and I'm gonna go even further. Um, historically, we used to have a customer advisor dedicated to an account because he or she needed to know everything about that account and how to operate, uh, within the constraints of that account. We are now able to time division multiplex these uh these highly capable agents across multiple different accounts just by providing on-demand knowledge base and real-time uh assistance using in this case generative AI and transcription, not necessarily an agent and the next step is going to be enable, give them agents to enable them to do, um, first call resolution, much, much better. Wow, love it. OK, so, uh, you have a unique position here in that you clearly, you know Salesforce, you've got Salesforce in your ecosystem, you're familiar with it. We get you on stage, you help tell the story, but being, uh, only a year away from AWS and working at Capita, you know, in your words, what are the benefits of this better together story like. Do it better than me on stage. Tell, tell the audience. Look, I'm, I'm a geek, right? And, and this is the only suit I wear hat, I don't think. Yeah, OK. Um, I, I would always love to go in and do assembly level code. Right, it's given a choice, but I don't want, I can't, right? So one of the things that Salesforce has brought is the elevation of Enabling everyone in my org to basically go in and describe with natural language what they want to do for their customer and to test it out with their customer without my involvement or any of my team's involvement teams sitting over there, but they're enabling teams now they don't necessarily have to build for the customer anymore. All they do is advise and guide, they are the yodas, right. I love it. Right, so, so we have a bunch of Yoda, but we have a lot of Jedi knights now, is, is the way I'd look at it. And, um, every single one of my employees, Captor's employees. Is a pod one hopefully will become a Jedi Knight in the future. I am absolutely. Hey, it comes out and but I think like from a partnership perspective, the fact that you can now purchase Salesforce on uh the AWS marketplace or the model optionality, I think again as a customer I thought Salesforce. One of these big bad wolves that say like you've got to have everything in Salesforce. You've got to buy every module in for in order to get all the benefits, but then to learn that it's, it's an interoperable open stack that's allowing you to choose your models and in this case, you know, Bedrock, um, being able to choose through Bedrock. Look, financially for us it made a lot of sense because it runs on AWS, allows us to retire AWS commit. It's like it's a no brainer. Why wouldn't you do that? Number 12, you are the absolute experts in the Salesforce ecosystem, and you have tens of thousands of use cases that you're already identifying. Why would we recreate that? Why wouldn't we use what you already built and is available on Asian Force Marketplace and and on the AWS marketplace and have it. Securely governed with what I know is the best security platform on Earth is AWS. I'm gonna have to slip this guy some money afterwards. OK. Last question as we wrap it up. You've got the audience here. You've got a lot of folks here. 33, like 3 key takeaways that you give to the audience as it relates to agentic AI. First of all, build on something that you know is gonna be there for the long term. You are going to get inundated by Everyone who's specializing in a single use case, but the beauty of genic AI is that you can adapt to any use case as long as you have the right platform. And, and the global reach, and that's what the AWS and agent force capability gives you. You can build your own, start building. No one knows the process that you're doing, the job that you're doing better than you. Build for yourself. Then share it with your employees. Right? And, and look, that that's it, and, and you will see the value. And then, um, You know, last one, have fun. I, I, I, I, I literally have fun every day. I'm like, I had an SI come in the other day saying, I'm going to charge you £2 million to do this. I went and wipe coed it on, uh, on Salesforce. And, and I showed it to the SI in like half an hour, right? This world is changing. Stop building. Perfect. If I can build, so can you. So have fun. Here's a few ways to have fun. Come visit us. You can build agents at our booth. Uh, come check this out. Learn more about the, the partnership between Salesforce and AWS. If this is part of your stack. Learn much more. Contact your account reps if you have have a rep. If not, come talk to us if you're interested, you know, don't know what Salesforce is. Happy to talk about that. And, uh, it's a pleasure. Thank you. Thank you, Samir. Love it. I will hopefully see you again on stage and thank you all for coming. Kim, thank you so much.
