All right, good afternoon, everyone. My name is Jake Burns. Uh, today we're gonna talk about migrations, um. So this stat is interesting because it hasn't changed much in the past few years. Um, cloud computing generates over 100 billion in annual revenue, yet still 85% of the global IT spend is still on premises. So the question is why? And it's been my observation that this is not a choice most organizations want to be in the cloud. It's just that Most of the ones that um I've worked with, uh. They're not having an easy go at it. They're, they're struggling in some way. And so I've spent probably the last 10 years analyzing this, um, in some shape or form, either migrating personally or talking to and advising, uh, executives on how to do it and in the past 12 months really focusing on this like why is this the case? Why, uh, is migrating so difficult? And so I, I'm gonna attempt to answer that here, uh, and I'm gonna try to leave a lot of time at the end for Q&A because some of the things I talk about, it starts off, uh, very simple, but, um, a lot of it can be counterintuitive, so I wanna give you, uh, an opportunity to ask me questions. So I have a very interesting role here at AWS. I'm part of the executive in residence team. Uh, we're a team that's comprised of former CIOs and CTOs and other senior leaders have all led large scale transformations using AWS Cloud in our prior roles, so we've been on the customer side and we've all successfully led a transformation. And so, um, on top of that we have a lot of these conversations with senior leaders across all industries globally. Um, on various topics, but I tend to talk about, uh, the ones who want to talk about migration. I get to, I get to talk to those, so I've had, uh, hundreds of those conversations in the last 7 years, and so I've got to see the good, the bad, and the ugly. So before this, I was with Live Nation Ticketmaster and uh I led an all-in migration to AWS. Now I had a 12 month deadline. Uh, largely legacy systems, things that were not born in the cloud, not meant to be run in the cloud, uh, no budget and frozen headcount, and the team that I had at the time had no experience with the cloud, and cloud wasn't really cool at the time. It was back in 2015. It was, uh, the stone age because when it comes to cloud. Now we didn't do it in 12 months, we did it in 17, um, but we were able to get some impressive metrics out of it, so impressive that we still talk about this, uh, migration uh a decade later, uh, reduced our total cost of ownership by nearly half after optimization. Uh, before optimization it was about 18%, so that's a result of having no budget. Uh, it's either do it cost neutral or fail, and we weren't willing to fail. Uh, our availability got better, our resiliency got better, um, all of our performance, uh, issues, uh, got resolved. And so a lot of the questions I get are like how did you do that? Um, well, the cloud, I think most people know by now, is very elastic and so it's very easy to find the bottlenecks. So the key is really matching your, uh, capacity and your utilization. Um, so you can reduce your costs while reducing or eliminating your performance bottlenecks at the same time. That's basically the key. Now there's 6 things that I've identified because I've looked at a lot of migration since then. What's different between the experience that I went through and the experience that I see on an almost daily basis and I hear from customers on an almost daily basis. And to be clear, some of them are successful, but not all of them are, and it's my goal to make all of them successful. So what do the successful ones have in common? We've identified these six pillars. Um, first is they have a compelling why. Now this can't be because we wanna save money or because the CEO said so it has to be something that the people who you're depending on, hopefully your own employees, um, are going to really care about this should be your company's mission. This should be, um. You know, something that's drives them because when things get hard, they're gonna need to be able to push through that. Uh, 2 is utilize constraints, and this is one that could be counterintuitive, you know, when people hear about my story, uh, you know, uh, 12 month deadline, no budget, frozen headcount, and then still was able to be successful, I sometimes say that's why we were successful. Uh, a lot of the migrations that I see fail are the ones that, uh, have too many resources, and we'll get into that a little bit more later. Third is the invest in people, and this one should be a no-brainer. Uh, the more skilled your workforce is in cloud, the better they're gonna be at migrating to the cloud and at operating in the cloud. And so the investment is, is total is completely key. Building momentum in a migration or any transformation. And a lot of this applies to AI transformations as well, um, it's super key because things tend to start off slow and then as you start winning that compounds and, uh, inertia can compound as well. It could, uh, you could just keep going slow as well. Uh, embracing simplicity is, is the next one, and I would say this is probably the, the biggest one that I see violated. I see, uh, excess complexity, in my opinion is the root cause of, uh, failed migrations and failed transformations in general. And so what this means is most of the things that people do when they migrate are simply not necessary or the ones that are necessary, they're far too complex. And last but not least, and this is a hard requirement, is having strong leadership. You have to have somebody who's accountable and they have to be uh have the authority to do things and it doesn't have to be a lot of authority but they need to be accountable for those things that they have authority for and they need to have a little bit of guts. So For the past 7 years, like I said, I've been talking to hundreds of, uh, executive teams on the topic of migration, and I hear the same, um, objections over and over again. So Live Nation Ticketmaster, we were, uh, Live Nation is an entertainment company, right? So I'll talk to an energy company. I'll say, well, that would never work for an energy company, right? So. Uh, we're special, right? Or the scope is too big, so we migrated, you know, we're $11 billion revenue runway business at the time, much more today, but there are companies that are much bigger than that, and they can very easily say it would never work at our scale. And um the 3rd most common, and it's almost always these 3. Uh, is that we have unique regulatory requirements, so the cloud won't work for us or it's hard for us to migrate that quickly because of that. But the thing is, when you strip away all the assumptions of complexity. Cloud migration is really simple. It's really moving your applications and data from one place to another. Sometimes it's a virtualized environment, uh, in your data center to a virtualized environment in the cloud. And yes, maybe it's a different technology, but most of us who are doing cloud migrations, we've done data center consolidations in the past. It's very similar, doesn't have to be that much different. So I could say this with confidence, um, because I've done it, but I could say it even more with confidence now because I've helped so many others do it as well. It really is this simple. Now there are workloads that are difficult to migrate, you know, mainframes, for example, that require a full refactor, but those are unique edge cases. Those are not the most common. Um, so a more generalized approach is a better approach. Let's manage by the exceptions as exceptions, and let's take the complexity out of the 99% that could be easy. So a good migration framework is universal. It'll use, it'll work in every industry because your servers don't care what industry your business is in. It's effective at any scale because a good framework, any good framework is is a scalable one, right? You take something that works and you scale it up, um, and this has been proven, uh, with this methodology as well, and it should have compliance built in. A good framework should not violate compliance. It should be flexible enough to handle compliance. So there's some lessons that I've learned uh through this process, um, and some of them can be a little bit counterintuitive. This is one of them. You're more likely to fail from too few constraints than from too many. This is one that people find surprising. It's like, wait a minute, you're gonna take resources away from me and I'm gonna be more successful? Yes, that's usually the case. Most, uh, cloud migrations are overfunded and their deadlines are way too long in the future. You know, I had a 12 month deadline. It took me 17 months. If I had a 17 month deadline, I think it would have taken me 2 years. If you give me 2 years, maybe I never would have done it all, right? So, some of you may be familiar with Parkinson's law. Basically, it explains why in college when your homework is due, you do it, you start the night before instead of like a week when it was assigned. Um, We typically have too much time and too many resources to do things. Now you can take this too far, but work will expand to fill up that time that you have. So if you give yourself 5 years to do a migration, it's going to take 5 years minimum. Nobody sets out to do a 5 year migration, it takes 2 years, right? But you could set out to do a 1 year migration and take 1.5 years. That's a much more common pattern. So what this does is. When you set these seemingly unrealistic goals, it gives you a sense of urgency. Um, and if you don't have that sense of urgency, if you have too much time, you never get started. If you have too much time, say you have 100 things to do. Most of us we're gonna pick out of that 100 which one to attack first, the easiest one, right? Let's just take the easy one off the list. But if you had to pick only 10, you're gonna pick one of the most top 10 impactful ones, and that's what the sense of urgency does, the constraint. It forces you to focus on what matters. And innovation. You why innovate if you don't have to? As human beings we're lazy. This isn't a bad thing. It's efficiency, right? So if it's worked for us in the past, it's probably gonna work for us in the future. So if we've been doing migrations like this for this amount of time, why not keep doing it that way? Well, the reason is because we can't, and, uh, constraint, uh, forces that. So you're more likely to succeed with constraints than you are without. This is one of my conclusions and. Nobody wants their budget taken away from them. Nobody wants to be under an unrealistic deadline, but you can, uh, this is where the innovation comes from and this is where the efficiency comes from, and it makes for a much more interesting story, uh, when the odds are stacked against you and you succeed anyway and you'll be surprised. So Instead you put constraints in uh in, in, into motion and then you find a way. So a deadline forces you to find a way. So for me I had to begin before I felt ready. This is something that I was told begin before you feel ready, right? So I was given the mandate to migrate in December. I started the beginning of January. Why? Because at 12 months I'm not gonna waste any, any days, right? I had to focus on what mattered. I couldn't get distracted by things and I had to work backwards from a goal. All right, so it's easy, 12 month deadline, we're gonna be done by Christmas and work backwards from there. So, uh, a budget and, uh, more specifically a budget that's smaller than you would like it to be forces you to become lean, forces you to invent and simplify as we say at AWS, uh, you have to find a new way of doing things because the old way we just don't have the money to do it anymore and that's where new things get invented. And In my case, a limited headcount, what it did, it forced me to motivate my existing team. So I talked about in the beginning how I had a frozen headcount, no budget, so I couldn't hire cloud experts to come in and do the migration. So, I had to develop a skill. In order to be successful, I had to develop the skill of motivating my team, getting them upskilled very quickly and enabling them to be successful. Now, It's not an easy thing to do. I'll give you the playbook and I'll answer your questions and I'll tell you exactly how to do it, but once you do that, it is like having a superpower when you can take people who don't have the skill that you need, and this is applicable to AI right now too. Everybody's looking for AI talent. Good luck hiring those people they're in high demand, but you could take the people you have and if you can get them interested in it and you can get them um able to learn it and then you can get them able to use it and with a uh in a meaningful way within your organization, you could have an endless pipeline of talent and that is as a leader, it's one of the most liberating feelings you can have. So One of the other things that I see uh. I would say anti-pattern is conflating, and this one's a little controversial, conflating migration and modernization. The way you look at it is this migrating, if enough, if people are having a hard time migrating and people have a hard time modernizing, if you combine both of them, it's like complexity times complexity, so your odds of success go down. And then the, the common objection is, well, a lifting shift gives you no value. Well, first of all, I'd argue that because your data is in the cloud and you can use that for AI workloads and you can do other things, uh, as well, but I'll, I'll largely agree with that. But I'll also say that you are more likely to migrate or modernize, uh, more quickly like your apps will be more modern and a, uh, a date sooner than they would be, um. If you were to migrate, then modernize, separate them, decouple them, do separate the complexity into different stages. Your modernization will be done sooner than if you try to do them both at the same time. So migrate so you can modernize sooner, so you can be in the cloud and you can use all the great cloud services. So this is a quote. This is me from way long ago. I don't hire cloud engineers, I build them. This is what I would say because that's how I felt about it. I was building, it's kind of a weird uh way to say it, but I was building a pipeline of cloud engineers. I didn't hire a single cloud engineer ever. I created them out of people who had IT skills, but they didn't have cloud talent. I think we could do this with AI as well, with any skill. If they have competency and motivation, you can build a pipeline from existing employees. And so. This is the strategy that I recommend insource your cloud transformation. If you outsource it, which is the default that people do, it's going to be seen as a threat and why wouldn't it, right? Because you're basically telling your team that you have no confidence that they could do it, we're bringing in others to do it for you. It also has a problem of these people who you bring in to do it, you're training them and giving them experience and then they take that knowledge with them when they leave. So in my experience, in my opinion, they should be paying you for that experience. That experience is very valuable, so you're robbing your team of that experience. And then it also incentivizes short term thinking because if you think about it, if you have some hired guns that come in and uh they build it and they're gonna leave and they don't have to maintain it they might cut some corners, right? But if you know you're gonna build something and you know you're gonna have to maintain it, you're more likely to do it in a way that uh is gonna be have higher operational excellence, let's put it that way. So my thought process here is insource the migration, let your own team do it. Um, you know, You're gonna bring in external help. Partners are, uh, an excellent resource, and AWS itself is an excellent resource and you bring them in, but their goal should be to become irrelevant. Their goal should be to upskill your people because your people are the ones who are gonna have to maintain this, right? And so in DevOps you say you build it, you run it. I think that's true, that should be true for just about everything, right? You build it, you run it with the cloud as well. Bring in the experts to transfer the knowledge. Bring in. Lower cost uh resources to kind of free up their plate so they can work on it and do your best as a leader to allow them to focus on it. So It has a lot of advantages when you do this. Just being purely selfish. The people that work for you or the all the people in your organization, they already know each other they already know how to work with each other when you bring in new people, there's on boarding and there's complexity with that. They know how your organization works. Every organization has bureaucracy, right? The way of doing things, that's a delay. Think about it. If you have to on board a bunch of people in the beginning of a migration, then learning how just to, uh, navigate your organization is extra time that it's gonna take. And Not having to hire them is great. The fact that they already work for you makes it a lot easier. So if even just being purely selfish, because a lot of times it sounds like I'm, I'm saying invest in your employees is like charity, no, I'm saying do it for selfish reasons. It's gonna make your migration more successful, uh, and you're gonna be able to operate it more successfully in the long term and it's gonna make your life easier. So it's easier to teach your cloud skills to your existing workforce workforce than how your organization works to external people. That's, that's the key point there, right? And if you think about that, it makes total sense. Cloud skills are relatively easy thing to learn, especially if you're giving them opportunity to use it, which you should be doing. Learning how your organization works, for some organizations this could be very difficult. OK, so I'm making this sound so easy, right? There are some problems, but I'll give you some solutions. So the first problem is, yeah, they're too busy, right? Every single time when you say we're gonna let you do the migration, they say we're too busy. They're telling you the truth, right? So my answer to that is, well, what are you so busy doing that you can't do a cloud migration, uh, or cloud adoption or building this new app in the cloud or whatever the case may be, whatever that answer is, outsource that that's undifferentiated that's stuff that you can outsource at low cost that's just keeping the lights on, free up their time and they'll appreciate it. Now the next one, they're much less likely to vocalize, but it's typically true they're fearful. What are they fearful of? They're fearful of the unknown. They're fearful if I do this, can I even do this? Am I gonna succeed? I've never done it before. For most people when they do a cloud migration, it's the first time doing it, so it's natural to be fearful. They're fearful, will I have the skills to maintain this new cloud environment. Um, am I engineering myself at a job? There's a lot of things that they have, um. To be fearful of, so we need to address that. So give them a, a, a safety net, right? They may not vocal vocalize it, but they need the safety net. So give them training, lots of training, um. With a goal, right? They need to know going into the training that they're gonna be the ones that are gonna drive, um, bring in experts, AWS solutions architects, professional services partners, all these people who can help them and guide them in the beginning, um, and you know, you really just need to get buy-in from them. And this kind of speaks to the last point, they may not even care, right? So we need to get them to care. Um, if you're the boss and they work for you, they may. Like, want, uh, you to be successful, but I think if uh if they have ownership of it they're gonna be a little bit more uh. Um, let's say receptive. So, outsourcing to enable, solve those first two problems, too busy and fearful. So, let's talk about how we solved this last one of them not caring. Because outsourcing itself is rarely the problem, it's what we choose to outsource that's the problem. We outsource the fun stuff, the cloud migration, the building of the new agentic AI system. We're outsourcing that to people because we see the skills gap in our organization. We should let our employees do that and we should outsource the boring stuff they don't want to do to make time for it. So How do we get buy-in? Because that's really what we're talking about here. Well, I talked about a compelling why. You have to have a compelling why it has to be something they actually care about and should be related to your industry. What does your company do? What does your organization do? Most leaders have this advantage and they don't use it because they just don't know how to articulate it, right? So for a live entertainment company it might be we're making the fan experience better, right? We're gonna make it. Uh, easier to buy tickets and we're going to make, uh, when you go to a concert, you know, uh, we're gonna have this interactive experience. All these things that the cloud will legitimately enable you to do, right? Just you have to tell that story because when they're asked what they're, what they're doing at work, what are they gonna say, right? Well, I'm doing stuff in the cloud or I'm, you know, I'm doing IT stuff, let them tell a, uh, uh, you know, a good story. So There's a, speaking of stories, there's a story of JFK, uh, going to visit uh the NASA Space Center in 1962, right? And, uh, he encountered a janitor and asked him, what do you, what do you do here? Right? And the janitor said, I'm putting a man on the moon. Right? And this is the kind of mentality you have to think of. The janitor was not telling a lie. He's helping put a man on the moon. He had, he had a part to play in this. Everybody has a part to play in the, in the mission of the organization. And when you instill that mentality in them, then they will be enthusiastic, at least that's part of it. That's one of three parts of it. Second is sharing the how, uh, you'd be surprised how many leaders keep their plans a secret. If uh you don't share your plan then your team might just assume you don't have a plan and you might not actually have a plan so this will force you to create one. But the other thing you need to do is uh solicit feedback allow them to, um, look, it's not a free for all, but like if you have a better idea, tell me, right? We, we have what we call tenants at Amazon and it always says, you know, these are kind of like principles, leadership principles for like projects and teams. It always says unless you know better ones, these are our tenants unless you know better ones and every single time it says unless you know better ones that should be the mantra like here's the plan unless you got a better one. This is not my idea how to do it unless you have a better one, so listen to them, right? Now, even if you don't incorporate all of their feedback, just the fact that you're asking for it creates a sense of ownership and the fact that you're sharing what you're gonna do gives them confidence that it actually can be done because like I could see the plan, I can see how this could be done versus we're going to the cloud and how we're gonna do it is just a big question mark, right? So make it our plan, right? They might care about your plan, they care, they're gonna care about our plan, their plan. And then finally, what's in it for them? And this is I think an easy one with cloud because. You know with the cloud you like I said you could transform people's careers and um you know I like to reframe we're engineering ourselves out of a job into we're uh engineering ourselves into a better job and this is the truth it's just a reframe right? And so when they understand that when they understand that um you know. If you're the type of organization that's gonna give them training, get them certifications, allow them to actually be hands on and do the work, that's rare, and you happen to work for a company like this, at the end of this, um, you're not gonna care about job security. I'm gonna be fighting to keep you, right? And you should ask me for a raise. doesn't mean I can give you one, but you should definitely ask for one, right? I wasn't able to give many, but, uh, I encouraged them to ask. Um, so these are the three ingredients, and you can use this not just with your employees but with your peers and with your, uh, management, whoever you need to, uh, get buy-in from, uh, for transformative change. So, Then you upskill, but the upskilling, uh, there's some very specific things that I recommend you do with upskilling. First, you have to buy-in, which we just talked about, because if they don't care, then like it's just a paid vacation you send them to training, right? Um, get the timing right, do it, do the training like for me I had to do the training while I was doing the migration, so I actually had to get so much buy-in from my team. That they, uh, they were willing to do 3 jobs at once, right? Uh, training in the morning, migration in the afternoon, and in your free time just try to keep the business running, right? So that was a lot to ask. Now you don't necessarily have to do them at the same time, but the next best thing is to do the training immediately before the migration. If any interval that you have in between that knowledge tends to get forgotten. So putting it into practice as quickly as possible is super, uh, important. And there's the other things here as well. Use all available means. AWBS has a lot of free resources that we can give you for training solutions architects, um, you know, uh, our, uh, our partners. There's a lot of people who will come in and, uh, uh, help you get upskilled and don't ever stop doing it. It's a, it's a continuous process. So now You may have to hire after you've given everyone in your organization a chance to fill new roles in the cloud, you may need to. But please be give everyone a chance first this is super important. Um, now you may have gaps, hire for those gaps. Now it's gonna be hard to find people um who are qualified, so you may need to do a couple of things like adjusting your requirements. 11 thing I found that works here is everyone has anyone here noticed how many, um. Agentic AI engineer job postings there are, and they all want like 3 years' experience, 5 years experience. It's like, yeah, this technology hasn't been around that long, right? So hire people who are motivated, hire people who want to learn. That is a higher indicator of success than existing skills. Now existing skills is a good base to have, of course, but do you wanna pay a premium for that? So this is kind of a cheat code. Get people who are early in their career but are sharp and smart and wanna learn. Um, or maybe they're later in their career and they just don't have, they give a solid technical foundation, they just don't understand cloud and no one's giving them a chance, right? These people you can get, um, for, um, uh, it's an incredible deal, let's just put it that way, right? And you upskill them and then you have those people, you have that pipeline that I was talking about. And lastly you have to become an organization that top talent um that attracts top performers, right? You may have heard the the quote, uh, become the person that attracts success, right? It's kind of a similar thing like are you the type of organization that top performers wanna work at? You know, top performers wanna work with other top performers they wanna work on interesting problems they wanna be hands on. They don't wanna work for an organization that just outsources the fun work, right? They wanna work for an organization that's gonna allow them to become more valuable over time through hands on experience through training and all those things so become that type of organization, work on interesting stuff, um, and. Like, as a leader, care about making your team more valuable. I'd much rather have the problem of retaining valuable people than the problem of having people who are not valuable and can't do the work, right? So you don't get to choose whether you have a problem. You just get to choose which of those problems you have. So talent is something your organization attracts by what it becomes. Spend less time on recruiting and more time on becoming that type of organization. Think of like the top 5 companies in the world. They don't have to do a lot of recruiting, right? They have to do recruiting for them is sorting through all the resumes that get sent to them. So be attractive to top performers and the talent will come to you. That will help all of these help a little bit. None of them, none of it's gonna get you all the way there. OK, so Another anti-pattern. Elaborate committees and org structures. I don't think that this helps very much, so I, uh, advocate for a very, very simple structure, and it's 3 parts, and it's very easy to set up. First is your cloud team. They're the people that do the migration. You can call them whatever you want. I call them the cloud team. They're usually, uh, infrastructure. In my case they're a former infrastructure team. I rebranded cloud services. This could be DevOps folks, um, but these are the people who are gonna do it hands on. You got an advisory board. I like to call it minimal viable CCOE Minimum Viable Center, Cloud Center of Excellence. Very lightweight, very informal. You got finance, you got HR, uh, infosec, you got, uh, you know, one person from each, one leader from each of those, uh, just to agree on, um, you know, policies and how we're gonna do things, but not to micromanage and it shouldn't take very long to set up. And then stakeholders, which are everyone else in the organization, right? These are who you serve as a cloud team. So these are application owners or business unit owners, uh, if there's no application owner, right? Typically it's application owners, it's the app folks. So yes, infrastructure people, you have to answer to that people just like always unfortunately for the infrastructure folks, but, um, now the app people have to answer to the business, so it, it all ends, uh, ends up, uh. Kind of working out in the end. But this is a very simple structure and this is really all you need. This is all I used, and this works at any scale, um, and this could be set up in a day, really. It's not that difficult to do. Um, now, the stakeholders. You're we're gonna ask as little from them as possible and we're gonna give them as much as possible. So all we're gonna ask for them is, uh, agree to this cutover date, um, agree to this cloud architecture if you even care about how we architect it, and just give us permission to migrate it to the cloud and then do just, um, however much testing, uh, you think you need to do at the end of it to ensure that it works and it's gonna work because as you see, as, as you see in a minute, we're not gonna make very many changes in the migration phase. Kind of alluded to this earlier. Another benefit of doing it that way is that the migration tends to work the migrations tend to not have to be migrated back because we make very little changes. OK, so create a meritocracy. Now what I found is that uh within the cloud team, uh, your uh team members will fall into one of three categories. Uh, this is usually the smallest category it's the early adopters. These should be your new leaders. These are people who are enthusiastic about the cloud, and they may not be your senior level people. They may be, but they may not be, you know, in my case, one of them was very senior level, one of them wasn't. But put them in leadership positions that enable them, right? They're gonna be the ones that prove that this could be done to everyone else. You got the passive majority, right? So obviously that's the most amount of people because it's got majority right in the name, um, but they're usually just gonna go which way the wind blows if we're being honest, right? It's a if this thing looks like it's gonna be successful I'm gonna support it. If it looks like it's gonna fail then I'm gonna have no part of it, right? So they need to be won over, which means we have to start winning quickly and that's, as you'll see in a minute, uh, part of the strategies we gotta start winning very quickly and then you got active resisters and most organizations have these, right? And the thing is don't fight them. My suggestion is embrace that because think about it, they're early adopters and to some extent the passive majority, they're the ones who are complaining we're too busy, OK. The resistors, the ones that lovely, lovingly call server huggers in the cloud migration industry, um, you know, let them manage the servers, let them keep the lights on. Let them do someone has to do it. Let them manage the outsourcec team that's doing the quote unquote boring work. They love doing that kind of work. They, they will come around eventually. So Other things you can do here within this meritocracy is create new career ladders, um, you know, I did something funny, you know, you have your career, you have your technical track, your manager track, and then added a cloud track and you know it sends a clear message when the cloud track actually has more rungs on the ladder than the other two tracks, um, so create incentives, right? Uh, you wanna get promoted, you wanna get a higher level in this organization, this is the path to do it. Um, give opportunity to everyone equally, right? So one of the things that's gonna happen is people are gonna complain. They're gonna say, how come that person gets to be on the cloud team and I don't. So the way you get around that is to say, OK, a cloud team, you get to set the rules of who's on the cloud team, right? And now you live with your own rules. So we're trying to make this as fair as possible again, not to be charitable, but because it works. When you create a meritocratic system, you get better results because what ends up happening is the results, however you define them. Um, those who produce more of them get more responsibility, right, and those who get less, so it creates incentive structures that work and it also gets the right people involved and then be transparent about all of this, right? Let them own it and. There's no hidden um qualifications. All the qualifications are there, and I don't care if you're the most senior engineer on the team, you still have to get that certification if you wanna be a senior cloud engineer, you know, if that's the rule that you make. And I don't care if you're just the lowest person on the ladder, if you're a help desk person taking tier one tickets, if you can get that certification, you could be a senior engineer, right? So, um, create these rules, let the cloud team own it and apply it to everybody. Alright, so now we're gonna cram a bunch of, uh, more information in the end here because this is where it gets a little bit uh more into the mechanics of it, right? How do we actually migrate? I've been talking about culture this whole time, right? Well, 90% of the problems are culture, but let me give you some tips on the actual migration mechanics because this was a little unique how we got this done so quickly and I've been able to replicate this with other. Uh, organizations that I've worked with and so it is universal. Uh, I do believe it works, uh, any size organization in the industry, and feel free to challenge me on that. Hopefully we have Q&A at the end, so I'll let you challenge me in front of everyone. So what we wanna do is focus on the goal. We don't wanna get distracted. We're gonna eliminate all the complexity, all the things that have nothing to do with migration we're not gonna do them and the things that are necessary, um, but maybe don't, uh, make the migration happen quickly, we're gonna simplify it as much as possible. So we're gonna embrace this minimal viable framework, right? So we have minimal viable committees like I talked about before, we have minimal viable migration plan which we're gonna talk about now. I suggest creating a minimal viable landing zone, which is again kind of controversial. Um, it should take days, weeks, maybe most at most to create a landing zone. This is what we call a two-way door decision at Amazon. It's, uh, a reversible decision. Your landing zone can evolve. It doesn't have to be perfect before you start migrating, so that should be done quickly as well. And then finally, my favorite minimal viable refactoring because that completely gets rid of the seminars. I'm gonna go through that quickly. So we wanna make the process loosely coupled and non-blocking and if you're an engineer, you know what that means. It means one thing does not block the other and each, it's almost like a microsurfaces architecture and that's how if you put an engineer in front of in charge of a cloud migration, that's what you get and uh it worked for us. So let's go over it in detail. So here's the minimum viable migration plan. You first identify all the in scope applications, then you identify an owner for each of them. Then you map the infrastructure that belongs to each one of those so you know what infrastructure to migrate, uh, you map the dependencies, if any, and in my experience there's far fewer than what most people think we're going to determine the sequence and there's a formula for that that's really, really easy. Uh, and then we're gonna create cutover dates and we'll just work backwards from the deadline because we're gonna have a deadline. So here are applications or mock applications, right? We're gonna just go over a very simple example here. These are our applications. We're going to order them from easiest to migrate and least business critical and most stakeholder support. Those three dimensions are gonna go first, and then the most difficult to migrate, uh, that are most business critical and have the least stakeholder support. Remember stakeholders are application owners, so, uh, they're the ones we have to satisfy. We're gonna put them towards the end. Now the idea is that we want to get some quick wins here because we gotta win that passive majority, right? So now we're going to turn that into a migration plan. And we can only be sure of two dates, the first one, which is immediately, and the last one, which is the deadline, so that's quite easy. So here's why I do it this way. Uh, the importance of momentum. You find when you talk to people who've done successful transformations or migrations um it's always this very happy story and the story is that everybody was a supporter from the beginning everybody helped plan it everybody was a sponsor, right? Because the survivorship bias you're talking to the successful ones, right? You don't talk to the people who did failed migrations there's no owners of those, right? Um, so how do we do this? The problem is in the beginning you haven't done anything, so why should anyone in your organization support you? Well, the way you break the cycle, the way you get it started, is you start with a, a, uh, small, very small, uh, maybe like comically small, like a single web server. Um, and then you build off of that, you build a series of wins like once, twice, you know, what is it like once is a twice is a coincidence, 3 times is a pattern, you know, at some point it's like, OK, this thing is successful and you start getting people on board and you make a lot of noise each step of the way, right? Say we just migrated like a simple file server. I'll throw a party. Over that in the beginning, I want everyone in the organization to know I want those passive majority to know that this is working so that they come on board so that it becomes this kind of self-fulfilling prophecy which by the way can go in reverse if you do, uh, if you have some disasters in the beginning so we have to avoid that. And then, yes, so here's the quip, right? So you get all the support you need after you need shit that's the thing at the end you have a perfect migration plan and everyone's a supporter of your migration, but in the beginning what most people don't see and maybe some of you in this room are in this situation. You're usually all by yourself. You usually don't have a lot of support in the beginning. My suggestion, once you're successful is let them take credit for it, right? Um, it doesn't matter, you won. All right, migration planning process, a minimal viable landing zone, not gonna spend a lot of time on this except to say that I could fit everything you need in a landing zone on one slide with room to spare. So do it quickly, um, you can add to it. You do not need every single feature that landing zone offers. You can use the ones you like. You can spend as much time or as little time on it as you want, but it's not migrating. So I suggest you do a minimal viable one. That has the uh primary components you need and then migrate and then add what you need afterwards. OK, 7 R's. OK, yeah, this is the simple 7 R's. I'm gonna go through this quickly like I said because I feel like I'm beating a dead horse with this, but I rode it, so you're gonna listen to it. So what are the 7 R's? Can anyone even name 3 of these? I mean, I can't, so I won't raise my hand. They all start with R though. See that makes it extra confusing. So I'm gonna break them down. So repurchase means that we're not migrating. Replacing with sass, OK. Retain means that we're not migrating, right? It means we're keeping it on premises, OK. Retire means we're just going to shut it off, so we're not migrating that. OK, so that's out of scope by definition. So these 3 Rs do not represent migration strategies. They represent decisions not to migrate. It's funny. I was talking to an LLM about this the other day, and, uh, what was the joke? It's like, it's like deciding where not to go on vacation or something like that, um, but yeah, they, they're, they, they don't help us now. They might be useful portfolio management strategies they certainly are, but they don't have anything to do with refactoring and migration, right? So they don't need to be made up front. We can make these decisions incrementally or we can just not these decisions have nothing to do with refactoring anyway. Now if we talk about the things that are um refactoring, we have a couple of choices and neither of them, none of them are really good, right? So we have a full migration uh refactor in the seven R's language means we're gonna change the entire application. This is the mainframe, right? So I'd say that's like the one of the very few examples where you really have to do that. Um, but otherwise it's kind of a bad idea. That's a lot of changes to make while you're migrating, a lot of things that could go wrong. You could do it afterwards and do it with all the tools in the cloud. Then you have re-platform, which is a partial refactor. OK. Rehost, which is no refactor, known as a lift and shift, and then this really oddball one relocate. I think this was maybe the most recent one I guess they wanted another R. It's uh also a no refactor but from hypervisor like VMware, right? The thing is people could say well those two are different, but it doesn't represent a choice. You don't get to choose whether the application's on hypervisor or not or if it's physical, so it's not a choice, so you don't need another R for it. So if we remove the R's that have nothing to do with migration and remove the redundant R, right? We have 3 R's left. You see now we have a 3 R's model, we've already simplified this. But if you look at this, it, it's something becomes very clear. These 3 R's are nothing, they're not useful. One is like a complete extreme, uh, refactor which you know you can do if you have to, but otherwise it's probably a bad idea, but it, it's, uh, it's a valid choice if you want to do it. Um, you have a, uh, re-host, right? Uh, a lifting shift which really doesn't exist because you're not moving your. Server to the cloud migrate is a misnomer, right? You're going to rebuild it. There's going to be some changes that are necessary. And then you have Well, re-platform, which is something, right? Some amount of refactoring. So what we find is that there's not 7 R's, it's really a spectrum, right? It's an infinite spectrum of how much refactoring we do. Why are we choosing these arbitrary buckets? In fact, these buckets don't help us at all, right? We have rehost on one side, refactor on the other, which are very small edge cases if we think about it. And then we have this giant thing in the middle called re-platform. Which doesn't give us any meaningful guidance on what to do. It just says we're gonna make some changes, but doesn't say what we're gonna change. So it's really a one hour model. We're gonna do something. And uh Yeah, I think a one hour model is good, but I'm gonna rename it and call it MVR, minimum viable refactoring again, my favorite minimal viable thing in this presentation. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna do the right amount of refactoring to achieve our goal, and we're gonna do it as we migrate. So we're gonna do it iteratively. It's gonna be flexible, fast, simple, and safe by doing it this way. So we're gonna start with the lift and shift conceptually, right? We're gonna say, if we took this server and we just rebuilt it exactly how it is today in the cloud, what would it look like? And then we're gonna realize that's not optimal, so because some of the things are gonna get worse, so we're gonna do what I call the Hippocratic Oath of IT first do no harm, right? We're gonna say for security compliance, reliability, performance and cost, we're gonna do just enough refactoring to make those things not worse. Um, and then, but no more, and then we're gonna save the rest of the factoring for after we're in the cloud because it's just so much easier to do it then and we wanna get this migration thing done quickly because the migration is kind of, it should be a non-event, it shouldn't be this long drawn out thing. The key is to get to the cloud as quickly as possible and do your factoring in the cloud. OK, so now, here's the really animated last slide, well, 2nd to last slide. What it looks like in practice. And so what I mean by loosely coupled non-blocking. OK, here's our applications. It goes into stages. So first stage is it goes, it gets scoped. So a project manager identifies the app owner, QO tester, the infrastructure, the dependencies, all those other things that we talked about. They document it. Cloud engineer takes, uh, uh, the application and designs, uh, cloud architecture for it, which will be really easy because we're gonna make it very similar to what we have on-prem. It gets approved by the application owner or stakeholder. It gets built by the cloud engineer, hopefully using infrastructure as code, but if that's optional. Uh, at the same time you start transferring the data. So it's being built while the data is being transferred. When both of those things are done, the app owner gets to, uh, do their pre-cut over testing and approve it or not approve it and say they approve it, you cut it over and it goes live. Now, Now we've got to take all of our applications and we gotta put it through this process, right? So this is the one thing I needed help from the agency to help with the animation here. All right, so our monitoring application gets scoped. While Well, it gets moved to architecture design while email gets scoped and you can see kind of how things move. Through this pipeline. Now this is very simple. When nothing's blocked. But as soon as you know something's gonna get blocked, because it always does, right? Let's say, OK. Approval. We always get blocked looking for approval, right? This is very common. The guy's on vacation or, uh, just doesn't want to approve it, doesn't like it. So what are we gonna do? Normally what ends up happening here is the whole thing comes to a halt, and web email and monitoring will go live and then everything else waits, but we're good engineers. We realize there's 5 places where things could get blocked and we're just gonna put a queue on there and let things queue up. So then we route around the problem. Hey, file servers can stay stuck in that queue for as long as we want, uh, while the payroll application gets moved. And so everything goes through the process. We keep routing around the problem. This is a simplified version of it. Um, in reality, there's gonna be things queuing up all over the place. The key is we want things to move through this pipeline as quickly as possible. Eventually, the, whatever it is gets unblocked, gets sequenced back in. And then You move it through this process until you're done. This is basically how you can architect the mechanics of a migration in a way that uh can be done very quickly and the key is you're not waiting on anyone nobody's just sitting doing nothing. So just the principles as a recap and then hopefully we can take a couple of questions. So if you, uh, haven't, uh, found this out by now, I'm a fan of going fast. Uh, go slow enough to figure out what you wanna do and then go fast. You get your migration done quickly. It should be non-event, get to the fun stuff. Simplicity is gonna how, how you're gonna do it primarily. Uh, simplicity increases speed and de-risks things, uh, and it makes things less expensive. You've heard of the migration double bubble, right? Well, I didn't have one because my migration was so, so quick, right? And so the more you draw it out, the more you're double paying. So make it fast. Use constraints to force innovation, not just drive it and focus. Invest in your people because that is gonna be the make or break a detail. Uh, if there's any one, that's the biggest one. Momentum is the KPI so if I talk to uh uh a customer who's doing cloud migration, I'm, that's what I'm looking for to determine, predict whether they're gonna be successful or not. Are they going faster or are they going slower? Um, it's momentum is it speeding up or slowing down? Doing always beats planning. A little bit of planning is good, but I've yet to see a migration fail from lack of planning. I see migrations fail from too much planning all the time. It's counterintuitive, but people love planning when they don't wanna do the work, uh, or they're unsure. Migrate, then modernize. Again, I'm not saying don't modernize. Definitely modernize is the whole reason for migrating. Just, uh, decouple them so they're both simpler and, uh, less risky. And finally, anybody can do this, um, but only if they want to do it. Thank you.
