All right, welcome everybody. Appreciate everybody taking the time to be, uh, with us for this session. We're gonna, uh, go into some detail as it relates to EverCommerce's, uh, journey from a data modernization effort. Um, let me start by introducing myself. I'm John Sedlak with 5TR. I'm the vice president of enterprise sales. Um, and with me is Kalpit Patel, uh, vice president of data and analytics with, with EverCommerce. So we're excited to be here. We've got a, a, a really great, uh, lineup of questions. We're gonna go into some detail. Um, but let me start, uh, for some of you that aren't familiar with 5TR as a company, um, we are a data ingestion, data movement company focused on automated, secure, and scalable data movement. Um, you'll see here we're about 1500 employees around the world. Um, and we focus on, um, specifically. Operational data stores, SAS applications. We also work around, um, uh, data tooling. So the portfolio that we use is, is broad as you can see. Oh, sorry, I'm leaving you guys hanging with that. There you go. Um, it's very broad as far as the portfolio. We have about 700 pre-built connectors that our customers leverage. Uh, think about things like, uh, Salesforce and Zendesk, Workday, Google Ads from SAS key SAS applications all the way through to large operational data stores like Oracle, SQL, Sybase, uh, DB2, and the list goes on. Um, we have about 7000 customers that trust 5 Trans technology and 5 Trans teams throughout the world, and we have a global footprint both in North America, Europe, and, uh, and Asia Pacific, so you can see just a listing of some of the, uh, the customers in addition to EverCommerce that, uh, have put, uh, their business and their data movement, um, business in the hands of, of FiveTran. So I'm gonna real quick talk about how do we do this? And then we'll jump into the conversation with uh Kyle Pitt. So, as you see here, As it relates to AWS I'm gonna try to get as specific as I can. When you look on the left-hand side of the slide, you'll see that begins to indicate the portfolio of source systems that we move, right? You can see everything from again, operational data stores, SAS applications, even digital tooling like GitHubs and so forth. The magic happens on the inside, right? Again, as I mentioned earlier, 5TR has automated, scalable, and secure data pipelines. These are what we deploy for our customers to accelerate time to value, speed to value, reducing overhead, reducing cost. These. Are maintained by 5TR, right? So these are automated pipelines. There's no more management. There's no more costs related to that. There's no more schema drifts. All of these things are automatically, uh, accommodated and engineered for as part of our platform. We will ingest and move that data into. Storage systems like S3 and we'll talk a little bit more about that and the outputs as you see on the far right hand side to speed through this is supporting everything from real-time analytics, business operations, cloud migrations, and what everybody is excited about around AI and ML, um, as well. So with that, I think what we'll do is we'll sit down, we'll have a chit chat. Is that good for you? Um, and we'll talk a little bit with, with Capil about why don't we start with you just introducing yourself, uh, and your role at EverCommerce. Perfect. Thank you so much, John. Uh, good morning. Good afternoon, everybody. My name is Kalpit Patel. I'm the VP of enterprise data at a company called EverCommerce. Not sure if you guys know about EverCommerce, uh, but, uh, we are an interesting company. We are a leading, uh. Service commerce platform that are digital native. We provide solutions to small business owners. We are in about 40+ countries, about 700,000 customers. We really are very unique in providing services to our customers and our Purpose is very simple to empower and digitally make the service owners of this small company very savvy. They should not be worried about what they have to deal with from a technology landscape. They just have to worry about running their businesses, and that's what we really strive on. So Capil, maybe we could start with, uh, sharing with everybody here about, you know, with the uniqueness of 50+ organizations, um, and, and, you know, all of them being kind of independently operated, um, what was the data infrastructure like as you approach this modernization effort? What was the original state? So I was like every other companies, right, uh, when you go through buying portfolio of companies, you really have to deal with, uh, three different nuances, right? People process, technology, everybody knows it, right? But when you look at the data infrastructure at scale, you. Think about silos of data, duplications of data, right? Really making sure the harmonization is done properly. But when I joined the organization about 18 months back, it really struck me when I did about 60 interviews in my 1st 3 months, I went on a listening tour. That we are a very data hungry company. And in order to turn that vision from a data hungry to a data enterprise and a data-led company, you really need to provide accessibility to to data with the speed of light. And that's how we really started our journey on what I call is AKA data factory. We will talk more about what a data factories. So you had these, you had these many, many organizations, data hungry, but there was really no organization or plan, if you will, around how to consolidate those from a silo perspective into something more centralized. Is that fair? Yes, so again, like you know, for within our commerce, we don't say centralization. We really say we are an Enablement center because our goal is to really enable the businesses and take them to the next level whether it's in terms of technology, but we are not building just a data factory, we are enabling the future of what our customers want and need from us with the speed of light. Great, great segue. So as the business scaled. What were some of the, the biggest challenges as you kind of describe yourself getting involved and doing a lot of interviews and understanding the current state, but what were some of the biggest challenges that you encountered with that decentralized data? And then now here comes the plug for 5Tran. Talk a little bit about how the managed data lake service helped you accelerate that. Perfect, right? So. Uh, the three things that always comes to data infrastructure and building intelligence layer is, uh, you first have to understand the business, right? Everybody wants to do digital transformation, right? But if you don't understand the business landscape, what the company is made up of, right, it's going to be a very challenging task. So for us, it's not about the issues on hand, it's about the opportunities that brings us and the. Opportunities are endless, right? So having data in multiple layouts, multiple formats, because we, we bought a portfolio of companies, it really is about having them all de-siloed. That's number one. Second is, how do you provide data accessibility as we talked about, right? The third is, how do you really put governance on top of all of this in the world of AI, right? Everybody. lacks two major scenarios, which is how do you bring data together and how do you create a data foundation with a quality and a governed infrastructure. Because once you have that, and that we are calling it as a data factory. That's our foundation. Our goal is to build a factory. That's number 1 phase. Second is lay the machinery in the factory. And then the 3rd is build a factory and make it ready. For rollout, right? So those are the three phrases. Uh, with FIRN, we have been working with FITR for almost about 8, 10 years now. Last year when I joined the organization, we took a very strategic approach with FIRun. Rather than using FIR in individual companies, we actually molded ourselves to say, how can we use Fran to build a data factory, empower it. So we started. Using their product called Managed Data Lake, right? Our whole infrastructure and the platform that we are building is completely open data platform on Apache iceberg, using, uh, and leveraging the technologies of, uh, PR, but we are building it on the AWS S3 Foundation. That's super rock solid, and foundational in nature, and it provides the resiliency and the infrastructure that we need. Then with Fran, right? It was always a question about should we build it or should we buy it, as we have been using F train, we really decided to say, how can we provide acceleration, speed, and the momentum that the business has been hungry for since so many years, right? So we decided to use that approach, and then we started really integrating all of these desperate sources, leveraging fighter and managed data lake. So we talked, you talked a bit about the technical implementations, maybe talk a little bit about, you know, now with the large portfolio of companies, how does that affect cross-brand visibility? How does that affect, you know, again, going back to the managed data lake and the technology decisions, how does that affect cross-selling, upselling with utilizing that data? How has that affected the business? So again, like, you know, when you build a vision for data factory, right, uh, today, we are able to run the mission and the vision of our commerce. We are able to do the reporting, but it's not at the level that we want, uh, in terms of empowerment of our customers, right? So, when we enable the data factory, now we are able to build once and consume many times. So when Talk about data assets. You're bringing in data assets. You are governing those data assets. You are providing quality on those data assets, right, in one lens, rather than having 1020, 30 different systems that are disintegrated, right? So for a perfect example is today because of the data factory, we will now have a very focused view on how is the. Targeting working right? What is our achievement scores, right? How is the funnel working? What is the lead generation, right? We can now start putting more lens around enterprise reporting. How can we have standardized data definitions? Everybody just focuses on the technology side of the house. For us, it was more around the change management, really making sure that the business has the buy-in. It's not about. Rolling out data factory. It's about solving the business problems that we see currently, but also build the data factory that is built for the future, that is AI enabled, but it also has an AI migration lens coming from legacy as well, right? So more enterprise lands, build once, consume many times, and also provide self-service applicability to our business users. And then kind of now pivoting over to the, to the Amazon, the S3 side. What was, what was your decision process like to choose S3 from a, a storage perspective? So, uh. In our current landscape, we have AWS, we have Azure, we have a lot of other cloud providers, but, uh, because we have been working with AWS for quite a while, we wanted a rock solid foundation layer, right? For us, everything has to be fundamentally. In a shape that you are not just able to bring the data, but you are able to transform, you are able to mold it, and S3 provides us that when you, when you have about 100 different connectors that you are running on a minute, on a 10 minutes, on an hour scale, you really want that integration to be flawless, and S3 is probably one of Best engines that are out there. So if you couple that with fight and managed data lake, building medallion architectures on an open architecture using Apache iceberg, now you're not just building for the future, but you are building for use cases that might come when you're looking at the infrastructure from a scale. You, you, you answered the, the follow-on question I was gonna ask you just around how 5-chan helped accelerate that centralization and, and, uh, you know, you talked about the managed data lake service. Are there any other projects specific to, as we're talking about managed data lake service, we're talking about S3, any future projects that you can kind of describe to the audience, uh, you know, that you have uh in the roadmap as it relates to that? So I think from a future. Project perspective, as I said, our, uh, goal first was to lay out the factory. Now that we are done with that goal, we are really empowering and enabling our infrastructure to be AI and ML ready. All right? Uh, what does that mean is today, if we have to look at customer churn or customer retention because the data was in so many different landscape, it was very hard to do that. Now that we are bringing the data in one place, we can really run sophisticated. algorithms across the portfolio of companies to see, for example, if a culprit was buying product 17, and 10, now we have full visibility into how can you do upsell, cross sell, propensity, customer churn, retention in terms of Pre helping us, we also are planning to leverage Fran ecosystems holistically. We are a big DBT shop right now with the integration of Fran and DBT that is going. To accelerate us in our journey in automating a lot of what I call a shift lap technology, right? Shift lap means you really want to govern the data, qualify the data as soon as you load them and not bring them into your ecosystems all the way on the tail end. So we are a big fan of really doing quality in shift lab when you bring it from the source systems because bad data is depth data, right? If you bring in bad data, you'll have to really pay a lot of debt. So you began to, to touch on a topic that I wanted to bring us back to, uh, which is that 360 degree journey. So as some may know, the, uh, you know, 5TR and DBT are in the process of, uh, becoming one company. So super exciting and more, more of that is, is unfolding here as the weeks go on. But, uh, we've also gone through a process of acquiring, uh, a company called Census around. Uh, reverse ETL. So when you think about that 360-degree journey, incorporating the 5 trans, the DBTs, the census, how does that play into the architecture that, that you've already developed up to this point? So I think with our commerce, as I said, we are very unique. We are a very digitally savvy company, right? So we don't think technology first. We think about what is the business transformation that we want to lay out. So from a future perspective, we created something called DNA flywheel, and the DNA flywheel really understands who is the producer of the data, who is going to consume that data, what. And fight trains, sensors, DBT, a lot of other technologies. But for us, we don't go to the business and say, here are the technologies. We say we are building a factory right for the future that is the data factory, and the data factory is powered by an engine like Fran, like DVTs of the world. That is to really make the Life is easy for our engineers, right? And then we are putting an AIML on top of it with API as a service data monetization, which is our nirvana state going forward to really see how can you enable the businesses at scale. So it's all about digitally savvy business units driving forward innovation. Amazing. Um, there's a lot there. You guys have, have deployed a lot. You've, you've been with the company for, uh, uh, not a long time, and what you've accomplished with your team in that short period of time is amazing with partnering with the AWS team, with the Five Tra team. I know you have a, a whole series of other vendors that have been a part of that as well, um. We are going to, you know, there's a lot that we talked about here and we're gonna make everybody available to stop by our booth, and I'll put it up here, booth 1660. Uh, Capil will be there as well, uh, to answer any questions, um, as it relates to the, the, uh, information that we shared today as it relates to 5TR and what we're doing with EverCommerce and what we're doing with some of the other companies out there. So, um, I wanna thank everybody for, uh, for joining us. Appreciate it. Thank you everybody, uh, for letting us share our stories, right? And then, uh, thank you, Fran, right, for being a good success partners, right, along with AWS. Appreciate it.
