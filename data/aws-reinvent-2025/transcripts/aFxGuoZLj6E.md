summary: "Chris (AWS) and Brent Burgess (Macquarie Group) discuss the challenges of multi-cloud development and how Macquarie Group simplified their developer experience to empower their engineers. Chris introduces the common friction points for developers working across multiple clouds, such as configuring IDEs, managing secrets (SSH keys, credentials), handling network access, and installing diverse toolsets (Docker, SDKs, etc.). He emphasizes that this is not just a technology problem but also involves people and processes.\n\nBrent Burgess then details Macquarie Group's solution: a platform called **Dext (Developer Experience Demon)**. Macquarie, a global financial services organization with over 20,000 employees and a cloud-first strategy (AWS and GCP), needed to support a diverse set of languages (Python, Java, Go, Ruby) and frameworks across different business units. Their vision was to \"create a place where engineers thrive\" by removing setup toil and accelerating onboarding.\n\nDext, based on Microsoft's **dev containers**, is a locally installed daemon that provides a \"paved path\" for developers. When an engineer opens their browser to `localhost`, Dext presents a dashboard with a traffic light system. It automatically checks and fixes configurations—verifying AD group memberships, Artifactory authentication, and tool installation. Once the environment is green, Dext offers pre-baked templates for various application types, including specific templates for multi-cloud service enablement (using tools like Kubernetes, Crossplane, Argo, LocalStack, and Moto).\n\nThis approach \"shifts left\" compliance and configuration, allowing engineers to spin up fully compliant, ready-to-code environments in minutes rather than weeks. It also decouples the development environment from shared infrastructure, reducing conflicts when multiple engineers work on the same service compositions. Brent highlights the impact: rapid onboarding, seamless movement of engineers between teams, and increased delivery velocity. Notably, this platform, serving over 1,000 engineers globally, is supported by a single person, thanks to its self-service nature and automation.\n\nBrent also mentions their use of AI and **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** servers. They pre-train models on their enabled services to help developers generate compliant Crossplane claims and use MCPs to diagnose build failures directly within the chat interface of their IDEs. This further reduces context switching and helps maintain developer \"flow.\""\nkeywords: Developer Experience, Multi-cloud, Dev Containers, Platform Engineering, Macquarie Group, Dext, Shifting Left, Automated Onboarding, Crossplane, Model Context Protocol (MCP)\n---

Yes, so hi, welcome everyone. My name's Chris. Um, quick question for the audience here, I know you're all very busy, but one of the things I wanted to understand is who loves installing SDKs and installing containers as a developer? This guy, OK, awesome. Well, you're at the right talk because we're gonna be talking about how to simplify the developer experience today. Um, I'm also joined by Brent Burgess, uh and I'll let Brent introduce himself shortly from Macquarie Group and how they've solved that challenge. So we're gonna run through today, what do we mean by multi-cloud. So we talked about the multi-cloud developer experience, but what do we mean by multi-cloud? Uh, how do we make that experience a bit easier for our developers to build, um, and what are some of the challenges with building across multiple clouds and actually as a developer in general. We're gonna hear how Macquarie Group has solved that problem, uh, and then we're gonna hear some of the learnings and uh some of the impact that's had on that organization. I'm also gonna share some um links where you'll be able to see, you know, more details about what I've touched on today, but also some other approaches that uh you can actually learn from. Great, so what do we mean by multi-cloud, it's pretty simple, it means using one or more clouds to, uh, you know, achieve some sort of purpose, yeah, and to deploy services. Um, we're really gonna be talking, um, about, uh, the developer experience of that today. So what are some of the challenges with running a multi-cloud, right? You may have had to run in multi-cloud for a number of reasons, maybe there's some uh functions or services that you wanna use from different cloud providers, uh, maybe, uh, you've had acquisitions, and then also you could be looking at, uh, you know, using uh tools from vendors that may be on different clouds as well, so. Well we're talking, uh, so how do we approach that from the AWS perspective, we've very much put it into a people, process, and technology perspective, I guess generally people mostly focus on technology, but there is the people and process component of it today. Um, there's a number of frameworks out there that talk about how to operate in multi-cloud, uh, so definitely check those out, uh, as you get into that process. So let's talk about specifically challenges for the developer, right. So when we look at IDEs, when a developer rocks up to their IDE and starts wanting to, you know, provide some business value, they have to install an IDE that's, You know, all of our organizations have way more than one, we've got VS Code, Quiro, uh Cloud for uh Cloud for Code, all those sorts of things. Um, you have to configure that in, in your personal way. uh you may have to configure some things for your organization about how, uh, the code is formatted, camel case or whatnot. Uh, and then you've also got to do, uh, you know, Windows versus Mac and all these sorts of uh things that we have to sort out. So there's one challenge right there, just getting the ID right. You start thinking about, uh, you know, enterprises where they've got multiple, uh, identities across different clouds, technologies, you know, all those sorts of things, uh, they've got network access to understand, so they might need to connect to the development databases, then they've got to manage their secrets, so SSH keys to access, you know, different environments. They've also got a bunch of tools on their desktop that you know they'll need to interact with, so Docker is obviously a very one front of mind, uh, they'll have to interact with Artifactory or some sort of CICD uh and these are all things that the developer will have to configure. Now what we've added into the mix recently and we've seen an explosion on and we're all here at Reinvent, we've heard there's actually a talk one right next door talking about uh you know, the AI augmentation of the developer experience, um, you know, how do we set those tools up in a secure way that may need to meet guardrails and things that your organization has. So there's some of the challenges we've got here. I'm gonna hand over now to Brent, who's gonna talk about how Macquarie has dealt with some of these challenges and uh some of the innovation that they've done to help. Alrighty, thanks Chris. um, so yes, I'm Brent Burgess, I work for Macquarie Group. So today I'll just talk a little bit about Macquarie and who we are and what we do and then I'll talk about what we've done to um effectively accelerate the engineering experience at Macquarie. And so Macquarie Group, we're a global financial services organization, uh, we operate in 31 different countries, we have roughly 20,000 employees globally, and we're a very diverse, uh, financial services organization, so we have an asset management group, we have a capital management. Group trading. We also have a retail bank, so we have a full end to end retail bank in Australia. It's a digital only bank, so no branches, no ATMs. That's a very diverse set of customers and clients that we need to service globally. Um, we've had a cloud first strategy for the best part of 11 years, um, and our cloud strategy is really about driving innovation and agility so we can deliver outcomes for our clients and customers at speed. And at this point in time we're about 70%, over 70% of all of our infrastructure and applications are hosted in public cloud. And so more recently our multi-cloud strategy, again that multi-cloud strategy is about delivering innovation and agility to the business. So we're in both AWS and GCP. Um, we have well over 80 services enabled for our application engineers, uh, to leverage in order to deliver value, uh, and applications to our customers and clients. Uh, in the last year we've had 2 out of 3 of every engineer either certified or trained in public cloud, and we have well over 1000 applications hosted natively in public cloud. So as I said, what does multi-cloud mean to um to Macquarie? It is about driving innovation and agility. It's about the best of breed services through the cloud services providers so our application engineers can deliver value and outcomes to our customers and clients. But what does that bring, that brings multiple tool sets, um, different environments, you think about the different parts of our business, whether it's asset management, capital management, trading, a digital bank, core banking, they're all very diverse and different platforms that our application engineers are working on. With that brings a diverse set of frameworks and languages. So frameworks are always changing, they're always upgrading. Um, the languages that we use prim uh predominantly Python, Java, Go, Ruby, so we have to support all of those different uh languages and the associated frameworks across a global diverse business. And of course that requires a broad skill set, so our engineers have to be multifaceted, they have to be capable of working on different tools and different platforms in order to um service the demands of of our business. And of course again that's in the context of an organization that operates in 31 different countries, 20,000 employees, and multiple different markets. So our vision at Macquarie. Is to create a place where engineers thrive, and so what do we mean by that? We want to empower our developers, we want to give them the best tools, the sharpest tools, the best uh laptops, the best frameworks, the latest languages in order for them to deliver outcomes for our customers and our clients. We want to accelerate delivery, we wanna keep our engineers focused on business problems as opposed to some of the challenges Chris spoke about at the start. So whether that's SSH keys, uh, access to artifactory, are you, are you in the right AD group, do you have the right tools and frameworks installed on your laptop? We wanna take the the vast majority of that complexity away from our engineers so they can focus on accelerating delivery for our customers and clients. And again that really just enables us to deliver business outcomes at scale across a globally diverse business. And so how do we do that? We've built a platform that we call Dxt. So that's our developer experience, Demon. It's based on Microsoft's dev containers, and I'll walk you through a few examples of how that works and then I'll give you a real world example of how we've enabled multi-cloud development using the Dxs platform. And so what does DEX do? It's about rapid onboarding. It's taking away the complexity of whether you're in a particular AD group, have you authenticated with Artifactory, do you have Docker installed, is the sidecart running, all of the frameworks and tools that you need locally in order to be productive on day one. It's about providing that paved path, so rather than having a multitude of different environment setups for each engineer within the same team, we have these um consistent environments so we can manage and support them uh at a at a global scale. And then being a a global financial services company, we are regulated in multiple markets. We have our own internal control frameworks and security requirements, and so what we do is we try to shift left all of those compliance controls and frameworks into the engineering experience on the local laptop as opposed to dealing with them later in the development cycle as you approach production. And again, all of this is about keeping our engineers and our developers in flow for longer, focused on business outcomes rather than wrestling with the setup of their development environment. So what does it look like? So every engineer has the dexed demon installed automatically on their laptop, and when they go to local host in their browser, you're presented with this really visually appealing dashboard with all of the configuration, um. Traffic light, and so if you are missing a configuration or something is not right, you can actually click on the traffic light and dex will do one of two things. It'll either fix it automatically or it'll send you directly to the documentation so you can set up your configuration, so you can authenticate without a factory or make sure you're in the correct AD group or have access to our control plane. And so that's really reducing the setup of the engineering experience and environment on the local laptop. And so once you've got the green traffic light for all of the configuration that's required uh to start writing software, we then provide you with a default set of uh dev containers or images that you can base your dev container on. And so as I said we have a multitude of diverse tools and frameworks, we deploy multiple operating systems into uh the cloud environment uh for the different types of applications that we build. Once you've selected the base image for your dev container. We then present you with tens of different pre-baked templates for the types of applications, tools and frameworks that you need to build the software or the applications that meet the business problem that you're working on. And for those of you in the audience that have a keen eye, you'll notice that we have both the AWS and GCP frameworks as a template to accelerate that multi-cloud service enablement on day one. So let's see if I can bring it to life with an actual real world example of how we do multi-cloud enablement at Macquarie. So the way we think about multi-cloud enablement uh at Macquarie is two aspects. We have our service builders, so those cloud engineers that are enabling multi-cloud services for the consumption by our application teams or our service consumers. So on the on the um service builder side, we have a pre-baked template with indexed that installs all of the framework components so that our engineers can start enabling services across multiple cloud providers. So we install or provide a stripped down version of Kuber Edes, cross plain, Argo, LocalStack and Moto. So we've shifted left the service enablement, the cloud engineering, so our engineers can use the power of their laptops rather than having to make changes locally and push them up into a shared development environment. When we first started on our multi-cloud journey, we were pretty fast, but it was only a handful of engineers and we rarely, our changes rarely conflicted with one another. But as the team grew, we found that this shared development environment, we were working on the same compositions to enable the same services, we would often conflict. And so what we've done now is by shifting that entire stack, providing that in framework in the developer container, we can do most of the engineering effort before going anywhere near a shared environment. So that's really accelerated the enablement of services on multiple cloud providers. And then on the service consuming side, And again, no presentation would be complete without mentioning AI. What we're doing is we're pre-training a model with all of the services that we've enabled on each of the clouds so that as a service consumer inside your IDE you can generate a cross-plain claim which is compliant based on the services that we've previously enabled. So again that's really accelerated both the service enablement and the service consumption. So that our engineers worry less about the controls and guard rails around each service that we've enabled, but leveraging those multi-cloud services so they can deliver value to our customers and our clients. And so what's, has the impacts, what's the business outcome of Dext uh at Macquarie? So rapid onboarding, I've spoken about this at length, it really does reduce the onboarding of engineers down from days and sometimes weeks, it's not until a week or two later that you find that you're missing an SSH key or you're not in the correct AD group to um leverage a particular service that we have internally. And so it's not just about rapid onboarding of new developers or engineers. But often people will swap teams, and when you swap teams it's almost like starting in a whole new company. You you have to learn how that team works and what tools and frameworks that they use. This accelerates the movement of engineers so they can work on different parts or different applications, even in different divisions, uh, far more rapidly than what they have in the past. And again, shifted left, all of the configuration leveraging the power of the laptop so that our engineers, particularly with multi-cloud, can focus on enabling services rapidly to meet the expectations of our business and spending more time in flow. And then finally it's about velocity. So enabling the best of breed multi-cloud services so that our engineers can deliver value and outcomes to our business at scale. And then ultimately empowering our engineers to thrive. Thanks Brent. Chris, yeah, thank you, and look, thanks for running through that Brent, it is really interesting and just a couple of questions that came to mind for me was, um, I mean, how long did it take to build an experience like that for your developers? Was it something that happened, Over years or is it something that's happened quite quickly, yeah. Yeah, so it's taken us a few years just to build-up the base capabilities, so we looked at the highest value, where was most of the, the toil, um, in the engineering setup and then um we've been progressively building out each of those base images, uh, to the point now we have tens of templates, and then we also have an innersourcing model where engineers can contribute to the platform, so the actual multi-cloud, Um, service enablement or service builder template came from one of the cloud engineers. Got you, so it's sort of grown out, scratching an itch and, you know, turned into the platform that exactly 1000 engineers are using now, great. And I mean, I mean on that, how many people support that platform now, um, given that you've got 1,000+ engineers as you said. Yeah, we have thousands of engineers dispersed globally and there's one person supporting the platform. Great, OK, so it kind of runs itself to some extent. Yep, um, probably that one person doesn't say that, but like, um, and you know with AI tools coming in and, um, you know, I guess, you know, you talked about flow of the developer, um, how are you using decks, uh, to interact or, or how are you seeing developers interact with your internal tools, you know, we saw, On the screenshot there, a couple of internal Macquarie tools there, are you using decks with, you know, MCPs or something like that to augment the developer experience or make it easier for them to work? Yeah, of course, so obviously we've, we've enabled the AWS MCP servers, ah, but we're also using it for our own, um, platform, so our cloud control plane is quite, ah it's very mature, it's been running for the best part of 11 years. And some of the things that we're looking to do again it's about reducing cycle time and increasing velocity. OK, so we're MCPs that have been looking at some of the build failures, and so as an engineer I can sit in my development environment, if I'm looking to consume a service, I can use the, the um chat, Window and then the MCP will go and determine and often give us back the correction to the claim, because it knows, based on previous um examples. Oh, very nice, oh that's great. Well thanks Brent for sharing all that with us, that's that's been uh super interesting, um, and uh look, I just wanted to touch on a couple of other talks here along a similar track. So if you found this interesting, um, definitely check out the Adobe's session. Um, it'll be available on YouTube, uh, within sort of 48 hours of the, the presentations there as well, so you can check it out when you get home. Um, now I did promise to share some links with you, so here's the, uh, QR codes for that. Um, the top two are the AWS multi-cloud, uh, pages, uh, but probably the the most interesting one here in my view is the Macquarie Engineering blog. Um, there will be a blog post coming around next, um, so looking forward to seeing that. But there's a bunch of other really great. Content on there about how they manage their control plane that Brent touched on and also their secrets management and a few things like that, so definitely check that out, um, Brent also mentioned that they used uh development containers, uh and and that's the link there to to that as well, so that's a really interesting tool that we've seen many developers uh pick up. So with that, we'll wrap up there, um we'll we'll be over here, so if you've got any questions afterwards, um, please do get in, uh, please feel free to come over and uh it'd be great if we could get some feedback in the survey, uh, that's part of the app as well, so with that, we'll wrap up there. Thanks very much for your time. Thank you.
