Hello, I'm Tyler Gim come from Samsung Electronics. Yeah, today people started our subject. Uh, let me introduce myself. Yeah, I'm Kyota Tyler Gim. I'm a leader engineer of core SRD part. Uh, I was, uh, operate, uh, I'm operating some. Uh, Project from Samsung Electronics just like Bixby and Galaxy AI and which are some main AI services in Samsung Electronics and also I'm engaged in some mission critical projects just like Samsung wallet and Samsung accounts like that. I will talk about the example of this project more during these sessions, yeah. Uh, today's agenda is, uh, how Samsung use AI agent to optimize infrastructures that scale with the Cast AI. Yeah, I'm come from Samsung Electronics. I'm not an employee of Cast AI, so I'm just, uh, explaining my experience, uh, during using Cas AI only, yeah. Yeah, people that touch the main item. I'm explaining the Samsung Electronics in glimps. Yeah, this company established 1969, and this company has grown into more than 260,000 people worldwide, and my company produced some mobile phones. Based on the Kellogg's brand and also also making some videos, uh bigger bigger displays and home appliance as well. Also put the B2B businesses and we are making semiconductors and it's also indispensable part of the Samsung Electronics operations. Uh, in the bottom of that, uh, slide, and also there is uh some R&D centers, and each R&D center is established globally, and so, uh, this R&D center focus on some localizations and also uh they are, they have some uh specialized uh specialized features just like AI or SRE like that. Yeah, here is the challenge of my company, and we need to operate massive scale Kuberneti operations, and so scale and complexity is very challenging for us because we are running our applications on top of multi-cloud. It's AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure, and Samsung Cloud cloud as well. This makes uh uh operating is more complex. We should considering more infrastructures code based on the multi-cloud. We are also thinking about some well-grained security policy for operators and developers. And uh another one is uh more than 50 applications running on top of AWS. Some applications are running on top of AWS only and some applications running on top of AWS and other other cloud providers and over 1000 EK clusters in our system and tens of tens of thousands of virtual machines know this is running for our applications. And the second one is CPU and GPU workload, and critical mix of CPU and GPU workload is very important to us because we have a separated team for training and importance from the training team, they wanted to have some uh some. Uh, Simplify the operational requirements. They want to run their training infrastructures running on top of a single Cuba flow clusters. In case of importance team, uh, they wanted to have some more GPUs with cost effective prices. And also we have a traditional backend and frontend develop developing company. And, uh, developing teams and they have, they want, they also want to have uh some uh unified requirement to us. Yeah, in 2nd, 2nd side, uh, standard cost saving limits is also important. Uh, till last year, uh, we only focused on the RI and savings plans for the uh cost saving uh uh policy. And uh it's a very attractive because we only have uh some commitment to AWS. We can get a more cost effective infrastructures, but from this year we are also considering uh Spar instance pretty much after the using the uh Cas AI solution, uh, Spar instance is very attractive. Without any commitment to AWS, we can get a more cheap infrastructures by using Cas AI. Yeah, this is the solution that and Samsung have uh some uh ongoing project called the Asian AI. Agent AI has some separated categories just like uh infrastructure management and security and change management or pin-ups and monitoring committee. And also ca AI integration to manages GPU and CPU workload. I will more touch about this, and banking optimization for intelligent workload placement is also important. In right side, uh, center of our agent AI, there is a C AI. Cast AI control the AI oops and workload simultaneously. And he supports the AWS EKES pretty much. Yeah. Here are some key challenges, uh, sca scalability issues. How to efficiently manage 10 thousands of diverse workload across the massive Kuberti clusters, and, uh, it's a very important thing because of, uh, our, uh, my operators needed to support Kubernetis person upgrade. Everybody knows it's very difficult because we spent much time. And also there is some problem spot lag in case of Samsung wallet, uh, for the Korean customer tend to not bring their plastic cards to the market in these days. So when the Samsung wallet is impaired, they can buy, they can't buy anything from the market. So for the Samsung wallet project, performance but lag or impairment and late uh latency is very critical. And integration, uh, complexity, as I mentioned earlier, my company making some uh over than 50 applications on cloud. So in this case, uh, simple architecture is very important. So I'm thinking about the Cs AI. We put only one component in our infrastructures. We can easily achieve our AI Asian architecture in place. Yeah, here is uh some technical solutions, uh, automation driven by AI and using Samsung's AI agent to continuously optimize cloud in real time. Yeah, as I mentioned earlier, some change management and security and pinups and other AIA agent is running. And they are cooperate and on top of this AI agent, there is also supervised supervisor agent is running. So when the implementation is done, and I believe this this operation system will be very smart. Next one is a Cateria integration, uh, leveraging intelligent automation pitchers to scale fast and automatically and right size workload in real time. Yeah, so when the implement CAS AI, there is uh no operational, uh, operational engineers, um, don't need to operate anymore, and automatically CASA AI uh controlled our infrastructures. And the next one is the pin packing optimizations. I believe that. When someone considering C AI first, in this case, they uh easily tend to focus on the spot instance only. But uh I had uh some PC in my team, but uh and the result was pretty good. Uh, when we are only focused on the pin packing automation, by using CAST AI, the cost saving is more than 30%, 30%. Uh, it's very crazy. So, uh, I think we are using CAST AI and simultaneously. The cost saving output will be more good, I think. Yeah, I'm gonna talk to you about the result and picture outlooks of Samsung Electronics as well. Yeah, quantile of impact, yeah, reduce the operational overhead. AI-driven automation, streaming infrastructure management is very important because of when I installed the CSII solutions, after that we can easily figure out our status and progress by using monitoring of CAS AI. I believe that monitoring dashboard of Casta AI is pretty beautiful, and I'm also talking about this aspect to Cas AI people as well, and cost manual work of scaling, provisioning, and optimization is also important. Less toil is very important for the operational team. I have more than 50 silos and. I implemented uh C C A AI. After that, they do not need to monitoring every morning our uh monitoring every morning. So it's also very important. And next one is improved application efficiency and real-time optimization, right sizes, resources continuously. And this means uh Cas AIA Cast AI is the AI AIA agent always checking the uh our uh our workload and sometimes sharing the some number of uh node or sometimes uh scaled out the number of node sizes. And the next one is uh immate over and under provisioning. Uh, every, uh, we can use the, uh, all of the resources in our physical load, and this is a very important aspect. And significant cost reductions combines the AI automations and the smart bein packing and smart UCG, and the combination of these three aspects make much cost saving outcomes in our company. And also enables substationary savings across turbonetic environments. Yeah, and automation means that we can focus on the other things in our company and usually we can focus on creating other agent jobs. We can make some additional environment for AI operating and so this is also significant cost reduction as well. Yeah, here is the future outlook of my company. AI driven autonomy and moving toward a fully autonomous cloud operation. This is the final goal from the logs from the AI. We are getting some more information about our. Infrastructures and by using that kinds of logo systems and we can create a more advanced AI autonomy. Also minimal human interventions required. Uh, in case of uh mission critical project, we need to monitor our system 24/7, 7 days. It was a very critical aspect for the operation because human beings can't focus on the monitoring every time. So when we introduce the CAS AI, after that, we can minimal human intervention required in our team. Second one is industrial industrial standard. defining new benchmark for the efficiency and scalability will be held last few years. For example, uh, pays attentions or mixture of MOE could be a benchmark and dominant in in this area. And these kinds of changes very big impact to our infrastructures. And so Samsung Electronics is more focused on these kinds of changement and we are going to adopt new technology in our GPU processing as well. Next one is driving cost effective AI powered cloud operations. Uh, Cost effective means we, we can using the fully optimized infrastructures and that is based on the C AI product and also we are more focused on the AI powered automation operations as well. Uh, lastly, unified optimization is, uh, uh, very interested in my team, uh, expanding AI automation across the CPU and GPU workload. Uh, you can see the GB 2 200 and GB 300 during, uh, this reinvent, and it's a, uh, excellent combination of the CPU and GPU. Also, uh, we already, we have uh some uh GPU and, uh, CPU com combination workload in, uh, our systems. So, well organized this operation is very important, I think as well. Lastly, delivering consistent optimization across diverse environment. Multi-cloud is always very challenging. Sometimes, sometimes one public cloud could be impaired. In this case, we need to fail over our workload to other companies in these kinds of. Orchestration is very challenging for the operational team, so we needed to make our architecture more simple. So in the middle of our architecture and there is a cast AI solutions. Yeah, this is all of my uh uh uh all I, all of my deck. If you have any kinds of questions, just let me know, yeah.
