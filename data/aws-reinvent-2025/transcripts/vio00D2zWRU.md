Hey everybody, welcome to the, uh, sports forum at Reinvents. Um, for those of you who may be new and just walked in for this next session, you are sitting in our immersive showcase of sports and entertainment here where we're showcasing how cloud data and AI are, you know, changing sports globally really. So if you haven't had a chance to already, I encourage you to walk around and see how leagues like the NFL and the NBA. And Bundesliga and of course the PGA Tour are um transforming their sport through through technology um but today's session is all about golf and I've got two amazing guests here with me. First of all, let me introduce myself. My name is Tyler Greene. I'm on our AWS sports marketing team. Um, and I'm gonna introduce our guests here that we're gonna ask some questions to, which is a little intimidating to be sitting next to Amanda Bionis. Um, Amanda actually worked as an in-house reporter for the PGA Tour before joining CBS in 2017. And um she's she's really seen the evolution of golf media from the inside so you've probably seen her on TV covering some of golf's biggest moments interviewing some of golf's biggest stars um and you're usually the one asking the questions so I know do you wanna switch places? I'm way less comfortable on this side. OK, maybe a little bit. Thank you for being here. Thank you for having me. Next, Chad Mum, uh, who's the co-founder and president of Pro Shop Holdings, uh, he's the. Creative mind behind Full Swing on Netflix, which is one of my favorite things that's happened in golf in the last 10 years, um, Pro also Pro Shop also acquired Scratch, so that does a lot of the digital media behind with the PGA Tour, um, and most recently, which you'll talk a little bit about, um, just aired and revitalized and brought back, yes, yes, yes, yes, the Skins game which was on Black Friday on our own Prime Video. So, uh, we'll talk a little bit more about that. So thank you so much for being here. Let's dive in a little bit. Um, today we're gonna explore how technology is transforming golf. So let me just set the stage a little and then I'm gonna turn it over to these guys to, to do the majority of the talking here. AWBS has been partnered with the PGA Tour for years now, and we're the official cloud AI and machine learning provider for the tour. We've been, we've transformed their entire infrastructure to the cloud, so their new global golf home in Florida, it's an entirely serverless environment. It all runs on cloud. Everything runs on AWS and as the backbone of their tech, um, we've been able to process 5 million data points per tournament. Um, tracking everything from club head speed to ball spin rates to shot trajectories all in real time, um, and we're also using AI to create personalized fan experiences like generative AI commentary for using computer vision to track every ball on every green. So, um, and lastly to of particular interest to our broadcaster and and content creator friends, we've migrated all of the PGA Tour archival footage to the. Cloud so makes it really helpful, which I think these two will talk about about being able to quickly pull up something that's happened historically and provide context to golf viewers, uh, globally. So, um, as we've seen this evolution of golf in the last 5 to 10 years, let's ask some questions about it. So Amanda, let me start with you. What's impressed you most about golf's evolution over the past. Decade, I know it's a lot of big questions. A lot has impressed me over the evolution of golf. I think when I joined as an in-house reporter for the PGA Tour in 2011, we were still trying to figure out, well, first of all, I took the job as, uh, the Internet host, right? PGA Tour.com, and I've told this story recently that I was told by a lot of my colleagues in New York. I was working for the MSG Network at the time, they were like, do not go and work for a website. Nobody is ever going to. Assume sports on a website like you're you're basically killing your career before it even begins. So the fact that that's where we were in 2011, not that long ago, and now most people at the age of what 40 something and under are only consuming their sports on digital platforms, that progress is unbelievable. Uh, also the way I think that we think as as broadcasters, as rice holders with the PGA Tour, the way that we bring the product. To the viewer, I think before golf especially was not created with the casual golf fan in mind. It was very much like if you know, you know, uh, you have to play the game to be interested in watching the game. You have to know all these fancy courses in order to understand how cool it is and now that's just not what it is right now it's like, hey, we want all of these casual golf fans we, we want to be able to cater to, you know, the. Catch index player and the 36 index player that maybe just plays once or twice a year, um, but the way that you have to do that is through technology, right? You have to make it more understandable to everybody across the board. So I think when you talk about making the game more accessible, really that goes hand in hand with increasing the technology to make it, um, you to not feel like you're making it out of reach for those who might not, uh, who might already be intimidated by. The game truly so it's making it less intimidating the more technology we're able to put into our broadcast. Yeah, a great segue to Chad. Chad, you've been a part of that evolution, right, with creating things like full swing and the Creator Classic and just different platforms. Like, talk to me about golf's evolution over the last decade from your perspective. God, I mean, you think about what Amanda was saying, how do you make golf more exciting to people? And I think one of the unique challenges of golf is it's very hard to see the way golf is traditionally broadcast. It's hard to see. And showcase how good these players are. It's, I mean, there's a lot of conversation obviously. Amanda is at the Masters every single year, uh, and Augusta National, every time if you've ever been there to the Masters, everybody says it's way hillier than you expect and, and, you know, broadcast television as a, as a way of sort of flattening things and you know the way golf traditionally was broadcast, you'd see a ball flying through the area, very little context. It land on the green, a player would be happy or sad just thinking about the, the improvement of shot tracking and shot tracing technology and what that's. Brought to allow players, uh, allow fans to see how these players are shaping these shots and controlling their golf ball. I mean, that's one of the first, you know, of a myriad of different ways that technology has helped enhance the broadcast and you think also about all the amazing data we have. I mean, golf, unlike a, a sport like soccer or even football, there's a lot of time in between shots that you have to build story, and that's what I think makes golf so great is you can immediately say, OK, Rory's sitting here in the, in the rough on the left side. His shot shape favors this for. This reason he's gotten up and down from here, you know, is expected birdie opportunity. You can create so much context and then when the ball's flying through the air, you have these moments of excitement, and that's what ultimately makes, I think, golf such a thrilling sport when you have the context and you see the ball flying through the air. It's an inherently dramatic moment as you're waiting. Is it gonna be as close as we think, you know, and I, I come back to, I don't know how many people here watched the Masters this year, but it's the most stressed out I've ever been on Sunday watching Rory, you know, try to get it done. But when he was standing to the left of that 15th. Uh, hole, you know, he's got that second shot. I mean, imagine watching that broadcast 15 years ago. It would've been really exciting, but as soon as that ball flight comes out and you see it start to turn and you hear Jim's voice, is it enough? It is, you know, the shot of a lifetime, um, you know, I think we have so many more tools now to help contextualize how these pro athletes are getting things done out there and, and how good they are. And then the second thing I, I'd add is like golf's in the middle of a consumer boom right now and. You know, in, in some ways there's, there's 35 million golfers, 35 to 50 average you wanna count it, uh, in the United States alone, and a lot of that 15 million of those people started playing golf kind of during COVID, and there's been a lot of this. barrier to entry to golf that has come down used to be seen as this very elitist sport, sort of the country clubs, uh, you know, kind of out of touch old people sport, and the new wave of consumers that have come to the game, way more diverse, way more male-female split, almost fifty-fifty, way younger, you know, you think about golf as an older demographic, the, the new people coming into the game way, way younger, and the idea of getting a club in people's hands, it used to be you had to go to a golf course and play. Now it's through things like Topgolf or, you know, putt shack. Or simulators or you know even like video games and virtual reality golf like there's so many ways to kind of experience golf and try for the first time and then the other thing too I think you know hopefully look some of the work that I've been lucky enough to be a part of like Happy Gilmore 2 or Full Swing or Greater Classic of these projects, uh, you know, we, we try to put golf into the pop culture consciousness but you can't discount the, you know, thousands of influential people whether it's LeBron James or Saquon Barkley or, you know. Every country musician is in like a running game right now to see who's the best golfer, you know, golf has permeated culture and you know young people these days see these athletes and these actors and these musicians and entertainers that they admire and when they're out of season or off tour, they're on the golf course and, and that has created this groundswell of consumer interest in the sport that I think actually the PGA Tour ratings are finally kind of catching up to this consumer wave that's happened and uh I, I think that you know the future couldn't be brighter, not just for golf. But for the PGA Tour and pro golf in particular, yeah, so let me follow up on that really quick with you. You talked about it a little bit there, but, um, fan engagement, the fan engagement is a huge thing for AWS with our partnership with the tour and uh the DP World Tour, um, you know, the Creator Classic and the Skins game are sort of a new differentiated way to engage and, and interact with, with the game of golf. Like, talk to me a little bit about how this came about and how the sort of how the tour has been supporting you there. Yeah, so the Creator Class. If you're not familiar, we've got some great photos up here, uh, but that was, that was birthed in a breakfast meeting at the Players Championship sort of 2.5 years ago where I had a, I had just completed, you know, full swing season two, and I was catching up with Jay Monahan, who's the commissioner of the tour, and, you know, he said, Well, what do you wanna do next? You know, where's, where's the opportunity? And I said there are more people watching golf on YouTube now and on Instagram that, that don't tune into your broadcast on the weekend. They're new superstars in the sport that are growing in followers. They're really good players, but you know they're making a living playing golf for audiences completely outside your, your ecosystem of the PGA Tour, and I said, you know, you, you've invited them, you know, piecemeal. I think they've done some stuff with no laying up and a couple of creators where they'd come out and done some practice round stuff, and my pitch was like, hey, instead of just dripping, let's just like open the floodgates, you know, why don't we invite all the top YouTube golf creators and Instagram golfers to a PGA Tour event, throw a golf tournament for them. The day before the tour championship, give them a PGA Tour level experience, and we'll stream it on your YouTube channel and hopefully like people think it's cool and uh and it people did think it was cool. It was became the most viewed piece of content that the PGA Tour ever put on its YouTube channel. Um, the combined total reach of all the of the 12 participants was like 140 million people. Um, we did it on a Wednesday. We, we kinda, the creative pitch was like could we do. Space camp for golfers. I, I think this audience remembers Space camp, but I'm jealous. I never got to go. Uh, doing space camp meant like, how do we give these creators a chance to experience what it's like to be a PGA Tour player as close to the bone as possible. So we're, it's on a tour set up. It's literally the day before they teed off like 12 hours before the first tee times in the Tour championship. We had about 5000 people out watching them. It was live streamed. It was stroke play. They played the back nine. Uh, and you know when the, I remember watching Colin Murakawa walking to the workout trailer and there was a crowd of about 300 people, you know, 8 deep on the rope line, and he's like, what is going on? There's more people watching these YouTube creators than there are watching us in our practice rounds, and so, you know, I gotta give. Major credit to the PGA Tour for for being willing to kind of take a flyer on a on a really wild idea and kind of say hey we're gonna not only are we gonna invite you to play at our, our tournament before our kind of season ending event, we're also gonna give you access to all of our archive and we're gonna allow you to post content. About you playing in this event to all of your own channels and and intermix it if you wanna show your shot on the 10th hole compare it to Scotty Scheffler's shot, you can have those rights. We're gonna give you all the data, both your tour cast performance data, all of the information about how you played, and from that event, not just this year but all the way back. And so these, these creators, you know, the 12 or 16 of them who we had, their, their combined reach of all the video content that they created together was like almost 50 million. Views and, and so you took an event, you know, a day, a sleepy afternoon at a PGA Tour event. There's no prom at the Tour championship, and we turned it into a, a content and sort of ratings bonanza bonanza and, and pushed a new audience. And so the last like bit of data I'll throw at you guys was the, uh, the audience for the first Creator Classic was, it was 80% of the audience had never been a subscriber of the PGA Tour's YouTube channel. So it was reaching an entirely new audience than than what they were used to reaching. It's just a great example. Of I think one them, you know, maybe, uh, not thinking it fully through about just opening the doors to us and letting us run with it and then we showed up that week we're like we're doing this and they're like we're really doing it we're doing it, uh, but hats off to the tour for really embracing, uh, this new audience and I think our goal in general is, is how do you, how do you turn that fandom into fans of the broadcast, you know, the CBS broadcast on, on Saturday and Sunday? How do you, how do you merge the gap between that kind of online. And and the kind of core golf audience and and how do you take that overall audience and and bring that median age down as it as the PGA Tour looks to compete with, you know, the NFL and the NBA and these other major leagues? Well, you just transition you basically just answered my transition question here to Amanda. So you were just with us at the Creator Classic in Atlanta. Happy to report it's a little cooler in this room than it was in Atlanta. It was pretty hot, a little, little warm out that one. what's your take on sort of bridging traditional broadcast, which is. You're sort of bread and butter with this new creator driven world that we're sort of introducing, I think what Chad's highlighting here is that it's imperative to meet the fan where they are, and I think that's something that golf has been missing for a really long time where golf tells you what you should be doing, the way you should dress, the way you should act, the things that are cool, the things that are not, and now because of this boom and all of the diversity that is really being infused into our game. Now the world of golf and the PGA Tour is being forced to look at this and saying, whoa, OK, the demand is different here and if we are going to keep up with this demand and not get lost in this wave of influencers in YouTube golf and everyone else that's kind of passing us by, we're going to have to meet the fans with where they are and give them what they want. So I actually think it's a really pivotal moment in golf right now and to Chad's point, the PGA Tour has paid attention and they're not stuck in their ways and they're saying we hear you loud and clear, we see these numbers, the stats don't lie, the data doesn't lie. We have to be able to evolve and we have to stay flexible, and that's exactly what you're seeing. So the Creator Classic, I think, was a really great example, and I, I've stressed this a lot since my early days at PGA Tour.com. The. Cross promotion of things I think can get lost in translation a lot and I actually think it's one of the most important things that we can do if you're part of traditional media, um, in any way, right? If we're doing something really cool on the Internet, no matter what platform that is, that needs to make an impact then on our traditional platforms, how do we do that for the creator classic? Well, the, the greatest example was Tur cast, right? People are coming out to follow their favorite influencers, and I think sometimes. It's easy to forget how good the professionals are on the PGA Tour and the LPGA Tour are and when you're watching your favorite influencers and they're showing you their great shots but they're never showing you their bad shots really, right? Sometimes you're like, oh, they're all kind of the same. They are not the same, and the best way to bring out that comparison is to look at your favorite influencers who's competing on Wednesday at the tour championship at East Lake with the same set up as the PGA Tour players and then taking those tour cast data points and saying, wait, I'm sorry, what? Like they were out there, the pros are out driving these influencers by 150, 200 yards. What do you mean that's where. You know that's where Roger Steele's ball went like that, you can't even see it on the data points for professionals the next day. Um, so I think that's a really cool way to be able to fuse both worlds together, which I think is really important, and I think as you continue to see this progress, what you're going to see, I mean, Good Good, which has been an absolute phenomenon in, uh, the influencer space, they're now a title sponsor of a professional golf event, right? Like you're starting to see the future happen now, and I think what you're going to start to see is that us at CBS, we're not gonna be able to ignore the Creator Classic on. Our broadcast we're going to have to say, hey, let's take a look at a side by side screen comparison, you know, between, I don't know some of the no laying up or barstool guys or whoever it is next to Scotty Scheffler or Max Homa or Rory McIlroy, whatever it is. So I think you're going to start to see that cross promotion really hit because then what happens all of a sudden these influencers are seeing themselves on CBS having their shot called by Jim freaking Nance and they're going to post that. So fast to their channels and then people are going to want to tune in to CBS Sports to see what's happening so that cross promotion matters so deeply and 10 years ago it mattered more for the digital platforms. Now we're seeing that big shift where it's way more important for us as traditional broadcasters to be more in tune with what's happening digitally so that we can actually capitalize on it to continue to reach that younger demographic that are the consumers now of this game. I love, I love when you interviewed like Sly at the at the Creator Classic and he was just saying how humbling tour cast was. He's just getting roasted by his buddies because you're seeing, you know, you're used to seeing tour cast and seeing. Xander or Rory put it out in the middle of the fairway every time and he's like, you know, you're seeing duck hook left into the trees or like when you're only seeing the best in the world do this with their stats, it's easy to get lost in just how good that is. I, I always say we should bring back that show Pros versus Joes. Do you guys remember that show? I was obsessed with that when I was younger. Maybe that should be the next thing, Chad. Let's do it. I'm ready. I think that would be incredible. Dad's in the business of reviving things. Yeah, but that basically is like a miniature version of what this is, right? Your favorite Joe versus your favorite pro, and they are in two different stratospheres even though it's on the same golf course. It's very cool. Yeah, one thing to add to that, I think, like to speak to the two most viral moments from the 2nd Creator Classic, the one we did at the at the Players Championship. So you know, the most famous hole in golf, probably I'd say the 17th hole at TPC soccer, all of golf, the Island Green. We had this debate actually on my podcast. Is it the most? Yeah, we're getting no, I, I'd say to a Augusta National might, might have something to say about 12 or 13. What do you mean 12? Well, I'd say 12 and 17 at Sawgrass. We'll take a vote on this at the end of the panel. Yes, OK, so you know, talk about this exact thing, the pros versus Joes, the two moments that went viral. So we played the, you know, the back nine at Sawgrass on the Wednesday before. There were two moments. One was. Trent from Barstool, who made like a 14 on that hole because he hit it in the water like 8 times and he had a crowd of about, you know, I don't call it 1000 people saying one more every time he'd hit it in the water and when that ball finally landed on the green, the crowd went up like he won the golf tournament, you know, the, the roar was incredible all over the golf course, so it was like a one of us moment, you know. And then by the way, you flash forward to the following Monday, Rory McIlroy winning on that hole in a playoff against JJ Spawn. Uh, so, but anyway, going back to that, the first moment was Trent just showing what a regular Joe would do on one of these really hard golf courses with all the pressure of people watching live, uh, and then the other moment was, I don't know if you follow Bob does sports, but one of their talents is a guy named Fat Perez, who loved Fat Perez. So he found himself during the tournament in the exact same place where Tiger Woods was when he won the, uh, the players championship in 2001, and there's a very famous putt. It was Saturday. It's the better than most putt, so that's, you know, the ball's rolling down the hill, better than most, better than. Than most, how about in Johnny Miller and then boom fist pump. So of course what happens Fat Prez finds himself there. He's also wearing a white shirt, hits the exact same putt, drains it from the exact same spot almost exactly to the exact second that Tiger does. And so we, we over immediately were able to like, given that all the PGA Tour archive is all in the cloud now, our team on the broadcast was able to go find that clip of Tiger, marry it next to Fat Perez's putt, and they put, put out a tweet that was fatter than most. We got into a little bit of trouble, a little trouble for that, but, uh, but it ended up going viral, and I think just another great example of, of, look, it's a Wednesday, you know, it was a way to embrace, uh, this new audience and, and bring them closer to the tour. I think the other, the other advantage of the tour has is their events are a week long. You know, an NFL game is just on Sunday. You know, they, they're not taking over a town for a whole week. PGA Tour, you know, that, that basically the event starts on Monday, runs all the way through the weekend. You've got practice rounds. You've got, you know, Thursday, Friday, early rounds, Saturday, Sunday, and so, you know, for a fan engagement. There's why, why not reach out to that community and create opportunities to introduce a different audience to what's going on at that golf course and, and, you know, over, over time like turn them into fans that will come back and maybe bring their kids and be in the hospitality tents and become core fans, you know, I think it's just about opening the tent as kind of wide as you can get, um, especially in this world where all of media is just so highly fragmented. How do you, how do you open up that audience and, and try to reach people where they are as you were saying again. I think excuse me, I think 10 years ago it was seen as these influencers, I don't know if we were using that term then, but those who were trying to make a name for themselves in golf who weren't professional golfers, that they were actually taking advantage or trying to use the PGA Tour, LPGA Tour for their own benefit, and that might have been the case then. Now it's again completely flipped on its head. The professional tours need these influencers. Bring in the demographic that they're targeting. So when we say the floodgates are opening, it used to feel like, you know, that narrative was, well, they need us more than we need them. That's not the case anymore, definitely, yeah. So you guys both touched on it a little bit, but, um, any other ways that you use tour cast for preparing for your broadcast on CBS, Amanda, or I know Chad, you use it in your scratch golf tournaments as well. Any other ways that um that's being used? Yeah, um, I, I literally wouldn't be able to have meaningful interviews without the stats and data from Torcast. That is the very first thing that I look at before I'm going to interview a player. I don't know if you guys know this, but sometimes athletes can be a little sensitive, and if you can frame something that they're not doing well, if I frame it as an opinion, right, as someone who is a washed up Division 2 volleyball player, they don't wanna hear my opinion. On if their short game is not as great as it usually is or as it was last season when they were having a more successful season, but if I can look at the stats and say to them the numbers are showing that your short game is behind where you were last week, last season, or, hey, listen, your, your approach into the green has greatly improved even from yesterday. What did you? Fine there it gives them way less wiggle room to get their to not tell me the truth, right? for whatever reason, a lot of these golfers, they're very um quirky, and a lot of them don't want to share what's happening because I think they fear that if they say things out loud, um, they might just lose whatever's working or they might just like give in to what's not working. It's a very funny thing. Um, so you're saying they're superstitious, they're just a little stitious, if you will, uh, so yeah, it, it really helps me to talk to the players on an even playing field where I'm saying, listen, I'm not calling you out. I, I'm not putting my opinion like I don't care if you're playing well or not. That's not my job. My job is to ask you objectively what's going on here, and your job is to answer as you see fit, but it, I think it just, it takes away the emotion from. The moment if I'm able to just say hey statistically factually this is not going well what's going on? How are you gonna work on it it it it makes it much easier for them to be honest with me so uh stats analytics data is the core of everything that I do with my interviews. Yeah, it's funny talking about superstition. I remember season one of Full swing we have. Our first player who was featured in the show go on and win the golf tournament, and the next week I had like 5 agents blowing up my inbox saying, hey, what about my guy? Why don't you, why aren't you following him, you know, because they just, the locker room will, will kind of, they, they are very superstitious. That happened to us with our walk and talks. That's right, Max, when you guys watch CBS, every single player said no except Max Homa. Max. Did it, uh, for the first time for us in San Diego at the Farmers Insurance Open. He did the walk and talk. I believe he birdied the hole, and we thought like that's as good as that's gonna get right now guys will actually talk to us. He then went on to win the tournament. The next week we had 10 or 15 guys saying, Yeah, OK, fine, I'll do it. I'll do it. Must be the key. Must be the key. Uh, I'm sure it's gotten easier still though. Uh, so you know, we started how we use uh Torcast. So we have a Scratch, which is a digital media brand. We're rights holders of the PGA Tours, but we don't, crucially, we're not a broadcaster, so we don't have live rights, and, and we have a, a, a show that we do live every Monday called Dan on Golf. It's kind of like a live recap show. Uh, it's on the internet, streamed on YouTube and on TikTok and on Instagram and any place you could stream stuff on Scratch.golf, uh, and Dan recaps, you know, the week in golf and interviews the winner and not as well as. interviews. Thank you, Chad, for saying that, uh, but, uh, definitely better than your competitors and the other broadcast networks do, um, and, and so we start, you know, there's a really ravenous audience for, for Dan's content. He brings a much younger, different perspective to it. It's not meant for the kind of core fans. You see Dan there, you know, a lot more tattoos than Amanda has. Definitely you can't see him in that photo. But, uh, but we, we, you know, started trying to figure out how do we do something during a tournament, right? Our, our show is a live recap show. Well, what. If we did something on Sunday and so we went to the PGA Tour and we pitched them on essentially a second screen experience. We said we wanna do our version of the Manning cast. Can we, you know, sit Dan and his colleague, uh, in a studio and look at Tur cast and essentially, you know, tell everybody, hey, watch the tournament live on CBS, but you can also have this on a second screen and we're just gonna comment on stuff. And so the entire live broadcast, Dan is referencing Tur cast. We've got a picture in picture. We have live leaderboards. He's looking. At the stats he's trying to tell the story and because he's not having to call live golf shots he's letting the professionals do that. He's able to tease out these really interesting storylines and we've been able to uncover a lot of really kind of very wonky stuff in the data for the tour cast and the first time we did it, I think we had about 20,000 people like watching his thing live while we're also watching it, uh, on the broadcast and then the next day we recut the show, we include all of the shots now the actual high. Highlights of the shots in the moment and his reactions to, you know, tournament winning putts are getting millions and millions of views because it's fun to basically put yourself in that in the shoes of a viewer and kind of relive a great moment when you see a putt drop and, and the players celebrating and you see Dan and Ben here and they're jumping out of their seats celebrating and you get to see that pop up on social media the next day, you know, who doesn't want to share that so we, we kind of create this new hybrid where it's essentially a non-live. Broadcast feed of the golf tournament with a live component where we're able to tease out all of this data and kind of make these moments that you already experienced once on the broadcast, let you relive it again with a different set of context for a different audience cost, you know, across the entire sort of social Internet and, and that's the one thing we, we started as a test of the PGA Tour and they called us back the next week they're like, you guys do that again, you know, that, that was great, uh, and so we wouldn't be able to do it without all of the real-time data and, and golf. General again is a is a great sport for real-time data because there is time in between shots and there's so many variables that affect, I mean, as you know, Amanda, being around these pro golfers, the margin for error is so thin. I mean, I think when we were pitching full swing, one of the slides in our deck that we pitched to Netflix was the difference between a player who's in the top 10 in the world and not gonna retain their card is 1 shot per round. I mean, that's it. That's the margin for error we're talking about. So all these players are elite. It's the it's how you find that difference and you see, you know, there was a great stat about Scotty Scheffler this year where he was short sighted less than any other player in golf in terms of, you know, you hit your second shot, your approach shot in the green, um, being shortsighted means it's a tougher up and down, and Scotty just by design is never short sighting himself and it was some massive difference, the gulf between him and the next best player in terms of level of short-sightedness or whatever, and it just, it just goes to explain his consistency because his, you know, that's gonna be a half shot per round and. You add that up over the course of the season and all of a sudden you know he's rattled off 456 wins, uh, so you know we love, we love that about golf. You can always tell the story with the numbers and unlike other sports again you can set the context in the moment so when the ball's flying through the air and you get the fans, you know, craning their neck, it's just heightening the drama for when it lands and you hear that crowd pop. Well again, the importance of doing that to contextualize what you're seeing and why it's so impressive. Like I am a fun golf. I, uh, I, if I go out and shoot 100, I am happy. I, I typically don't even keep score at all, right? And that's the person that I'm targeting. I think about my mom and her friends all the time when I do these interviews. Like, what do they want to know about these players and what's going to keep them engaged when they're watching golf? If you're a golf hardo, you're gonna watch this no matter what, right? But I know that if you were just a casual golfer and you're just getting into this because you've discovered golf through YouTube. Through Bryson DeChambeau's, you know, YouTube channel or through full swing, we're gonna have to be able to contextualize this in a way that makes it interesting for everybody. And so that's the importance of data and statistics. I think for so long we saw that as kind of like the nerdy thing and now it's not. Now it's so essential in order to make what you're looking at really cool. It actually makes me think about even just down to a simple stat like are any of you Broncos fans in the room. Broncos, well, congrats on, on the run you guys are currently having. Um, and, and if you're not a Broncos fan, maybe you don't care about the winning streak that they're on currently, but you know what did make me care about it? The fact that they're the first team in NFL history to be on a 9 game winning streak while trailing every single and every single one of those games. Right now all of a sudden you're like, huh, maybe I do wanna tune in and watch the Broncos because that's crazy that they're trailing in every game and find a way in the second half to come back and get this victory, and they might end up being. In the Super Bowl this year, right, and they're not doing it the easy way, so it's the same thing with our top players. Cool, Scotty Scheffler's winning everything. We have to make it cool by explaining how he's winning everything. What, what is he doing that is so different and so fascinating, because the casual golfer is not just going to be glued to the TV just because Scotty Scheffler is in the mix once again. Well, the data is the data, right? And data is. Boring inherently by itself, but it's translating that to storytelling which you guys both do through your various platforms that makes it really interesting. We had a panel last night with Cynthia Freeland and Greg Olson where they're talking about that with the NFL, right? And it's the same thing with Tourcast. Tourcast is a great tool to be able to sort of translate that data into storytelling for the PGA Tour and for new platforms just like NextGen Stats is for NFL, right? Greg Olson's like a nerd when it comes to diving really, really deep on that stuff and really understanding. Pressure probability and all those things that you can translate all the downtime from an NFL game to be able to really storytell to that end. OK, so let's transition. This is a good transition tour cast, um, is being used very widely it sounds like by both of you. Let's talk about, um, something no one in this room has heard about this week. It's called artificial intelligence AI. I'm sure no one's heard about that. Um, I wanna note really quickly that, um, our partners at the PGA Tour are amazing. They were early adopters in AI. Um, we're using generative AI to do things like automated play by play commentary and building virtual assistants to answer fan questions and exploring computer vision for next, like next gen shot tracking, um, so I wanna talk to you guys about how you use AI in your sort of everyday work and the evolution of that. So Chad, let's start with you. Uh, like how do you use AI for. Creating efficiencies in content creation, yeah, I mean we've, we've experimented and used it in so many different ways that I'm even surprised when I hear a new use case and a lot of it's being driven, you know, not mandated top down but really bottom up from particularly actually our younger editors, producers, you know, it's like that generation to them it's just another tool and, and just like when I was coming up as a producer I was. I was living through that wave that transition sort of film to digital and my first ever job actually I was working for a director who was shooting on 35 millimeter like film, film, film, you know, and, uh, and I, I was, you know, a lot of gray hair, uh, and then we had this transition to digital and all of a sudden the barrier to creating amazing content went from it used to be you had to be able to afford the fancy lenses and, and the, the dark, you know, the green, the dark room and all the photo processing. And now you can just do beautiful cinematography on a on a phone, you know, and, but my era was kind of shrinking that down to digital and anybody could capture a great image. It was just about the creativity to kind of deploy it and so I think about AI is just this tool and it's our younger employees who are finding different ways to, to use it. So just like last week actually I was looking at a cut for a for a clip we were doing for another project and they, they had an all AI, uh, narrator, and they had taken a bunch of videos and fed it through an AI processing thing for one of our hosts and. The host hadn't come in to do their VO yet. Usually an editor would just temp a track in there and it'd be like, Well, here we are on the 4th hole, you know. But they had the actual, the actual host voice, and it was all AI, and she came in and looked at it and was like, Did we record this? You know, it sounded really good. It's just, just to hear it and, and be able to give notes on that cut in a more robust way. And then just even little stuff like our, I mentioned our Dan on Golf show, you know, we, that's a, that show's live for 2 hours every single Monday that has a ravenous fan base. I was like, why don't we have a newsletter, you know, like this is crazy. We have this. Big fan base. We're getting email subscribers. We don't have a newsletter. All we don't promote anything, so we just had a team go and they built an AI newsletter that basically takes the transcript of the show and breaks down every single thing that was talked about and it goes out to the 90,000 people on the mailing list. And so if you missed that week's show, you've got the rundown. You've got, you know, links out to a bunch of different places. Now we've got a robust newsletter business that came out of nowhere that's, you know, basically it's created and then approved by an editor, and we go in and give little notes and that's since expanded to our commerce team, so we have a whole commerce newsletter. Now that you can get from scratch every week that's essentially recommendations from the editors but it's aggregating social conversation about what people are talking about buying and using that data to power and a and an uh sort of an AI generated newsletter that's absolutely crushing all of its, you know, editorial generated stuff in terms of throughput and, and people's, you know, actual affiliate, the, the ability to kind of drive affiliate sales. So, you know, it's, it's showing up in a bunch of different interesting ways and, and I think like anything it's just, it's another creative tool. I think the, you know, there's a. Fear. I, I live in Hollywood. I'm down in LA. I've, I've made movies and TV shows, and there's a fear that it's gonna ruin Hollywood or eliminate all the creativity, and the younger generation doesn't see it that way. They just see it as another creative tool to help what they see in their mind come to life faster, which gives them time to polish, gives them time to be more ambitious, and ultimately I think great creative work comes out of giving the most amount of people the, the space to be as ambitious as possible with the stories they're trying to tell and, and the gatekeeping of what it takes to tell ambitious stories. Has come so far down from how it used to be, you know, to, to get access to the kind of equipment you needed to do a show like Full Swing, it, it's cost prohibitive. Now a creative person with the right, you know, idea can think really big and a lot bigger than they've ever been able to, and I think that's exciting. Yeah, Amanda, same question to you. I mean, from a broadcaster's perspective, or I'm actually curious on this angle, you often get the inside scoop from players. Have you heard from any players on how they might be using AI to train or. You know, preview previous course statistics that they've had or anything like that? Yeah, I mean, when I think about how players are using AI and they are, I remember the first time we heard of a player hiring a full-time statistician. Onto their team, it was Brandt Snedeker, I believe it was 2013, and we were like, oh my God, he's so rich that he can afford a statistician. Like this is like diva level stuff on the PGA Tour. And what we came to realize very quickly was that he was way ahead of his time. Like he had a guy full time manually breaking down every single thing about every round that he played competitively on the PGA Tour, and then that dictated what he was going to work on the following week. The the progression of that then was, OK, a bunch of guys started to pay attention. They all started doing that and now they're actually using technology and AI to pre to predict what golf courses are better for the players. So scheduling has been a big thing, right, for these guys for a long time. They all of their bodies are broken down like any professional athlete by the end of the season, but it's like how do I, um, how do I manage my energy and maximize my talents with the golf courses that suit my game. Most and for some players who have told me, listen, their golf courses I have loved playing on my entire career. I was shocked to be told by AI or by my team that like this course does not suit me. I should actually be taking this one out of the rotation and be putting another tournament in that I've never considered playing because the numbers just make more sense, um, so that's one of the ways that you've kind of seen the progress of um of technology and specifically AI and I know it's a well. Shock you guys, but Bryson is probably the first player to openly talk about how how AI helped him not only to win a tournament but win a major championship. He actually credited, uh, an AI company for helping him win the US Open, and he was using that on the range every single day before and after every round. Um, there's also been at the Masters AI is being used. That was one of the coolest pieces of technology. Again, I use technology and I use stats. Analytics um to to create a more equal playing field between myself and the players so that we're taking emotion out of things uh I was actually able to tap into exactly what yardages players were grinding on before and after their rounds during the Masters this year. So after every round, Bryson was very specific on honing a very specific yardage. So I could see he's hitting 249 balls between 125 and 1. 50 yards that information is invaluable for me because as I'm doing a pre-round interview with him at Augusta National when they're as tight as they're gonna be, they don't wanna talk about anything, it feels like there's very little I can ask them that would be um interesting to the viewer at home. I can say, hey Bryson, I saw yesterday you hit 249 balls in a very specific yardage range. What were you trying to get out of that practice and how are we gonna see that work today? Like there's no wiggle, there's no wiggle room out of that, right? Like he has to acknowledge, yeah, I was grinding on that yardage one because I've either, uh, with Bryson probably tinkered with something in his bag overnight like a psycho during the biggest week of the year, um, or he didn't feel comfortable out on the golf course for that, or he's working on a very specific shot that he thinks is gonna come into play on the weekend at the Masters, um, so guys are using. AI in a lot of ways, but, uh, selfishly as a broadcaster it's amazing to see AI being used in ways that we can kind of break down those those guards that players have because he's never gonna tell me, hey Amanda, you know I've really been working hard on this specific yardage that's never going to happen we have to find it out in our own ways and there's no way they can argue it when the numbers are right in front of all of us. Um, I'm gonna leave a couple, uh, a couple more questions for me, but I just wanna know that we've got, I'm gonna leave some time for questions at the end. So if anybody has questions, think about those now. We'll have some microphones coming, but, um, one second on that. So let's talk about, to close this out here, let's talk about what's coming next. Let's talk about what the next step is in golf. Golf's popularity, as we've both noted here, is at an all-time high. We've got more people playing. We've got more people watching. We've got more technology incorporated into it. So I mean, I'll start with you. Like where would you like to see golf continue to grow and. Fanom in technology, ways to bring fans, fans closer to the game, ways for players to evolve, anything like that. Yeah, I, I think the key is bringing fans closer to the game. I love thinking about AI augmented reality. I, I love this idea of in maybe 10 years, uh, someone at home can put themselves literally on the tee box on 17 at the players on 16, and, and hear the crowds, right? I, I think that's the number one thing. That we can always improve upon in terms of golf and allowing a fan to understand just how intense it is. Actually, yesterday I was out at the pro-am for AWS reinvent. And it was really cool. They brought out some, some new technology that was being tested yesterday that we are likely going to be seeing out on the PGA Tour this upcoming season, which the, the tech nerd in me was obsessed with that. Uh, they brought out Dan Hicks and Bones Mackay to call golf shots, and then I did some post round interviews, uh, after, after a specific hole, and every single A that I got to interview yesterday with their pro, they were like, my heart is beating out of my chest like I'm sweating. I can't believe this is what the players. Deal with every single hole every single day of their lives and I'm like, yes, that's going to make your enjoyment of viewing so much better now moving forward because you have like this tiny example of what it's actually like to be in the game and it's funny because I don't think we really need that for NFL, right? Like none of us really want to know what it feels like to be tackled by the top edge rusher in the NFL like we kind of know that would hurt we know they're big we know they're fast we do. Need that more in golf, um, so I think it would be an amazing thing in 10 years from now for you to say, man, I wonder what it's like. I wonder how loud it is right there, right now, and for us to be able to contextualize that through technology, through progressive technology where you can kind of almost put yourself inside the ropes, uh, maybe as a top player like Scotty Scheffler or maybe as your favorite player who isn't getting a, a Jake Knapp, right? The, the difference in what they're experiencing is night and day and. I, I think those are the really cool things that we love about golf that if you're a fan at home you don't necessarily get to see or you don't get to understand. Um, I, I think being able to bring that to fans at home would be a game changing thing for all of us. Yeah, I mean just that that reminds me of we're doing season 4 of Full swing right now and we're focusing on, uh, the Ryder Cup obviously and the Europeans worked with a VR company. There's a company called Golf Plus that makes a VR, uh, golf game for the MetaQuest headset. And they had the entire Beth page build out for the for the Ryder Cup simulated in the game and so I was able to demo that alongside the European players and they had a full-time uh insult guy who they brought in to basically just they had done a bunch of research on each of the players and they're like this is what it's gonna be like and they brought him into a broadcast booth like you would record VO and had this New York guy, hey you Rory, you know, just give him, give him the business and every player and all kinds of just insults but. You, you put on that headset and immediately you're transported into this arena, and I played Beth Beth Page Black. I lived in New York for a while. I used to take the Long Island Railroad, my golf clubs out of Penn Station out there when I was younger, and, uh, and just seeing the build, you can't prepare yourself for what it's like to step on that tee, but that's the closest facsimile, you know, with the VO, uh, insult guy, you know, shouting in your ear, and, and that actually got me obsessed with that game. So I ended up buying a Quest and, and starting that game. And now my 5 year old likes to play on the driving range in our living room and hit golf balls and they. Him like golf is, is in a virtual reality and, and by the way, his move looks pretty good like for for swinging with a with a club in VR. So I think one it's about creating uh consumer opportunities and golf in general, especially the professional side of the game, is very focused. It has a very healthy and very strong demographic that marketers that people attend conferences like this like to reach like it's key business decision makers, it's CTOs, it's CIOs, it's CMOs, things like that. But golf's got this consumer boom that's happening and I don't think pro golf has done. Good enough job at embracing that younger audience that necessarily aren't key business decision makers but are just sports fans who maybe play golf on the weekends and that's all they, they build their life around it. I mean golf has become a lifestyle for millions and millions of people. It's what they dress, it's, you know, in our kind of culture there's not a lot of chances you get to go put on an outfit, but playing golf, you know, I know a lot of guys that will like spend the night and like lay out their clothes and not doing that for a job interview. I'll tell you how much, um, so I think as golf becomes a lifestyle for more people, it's not one monolithic. Audience, you know, you can't think about it as like the golf audience. You have to think about it as a bunch of collections of different identities around the game. There's the casual audience. There's people who like to go out and crush a few White Claws with their buddies that turns into now I'm getting a little more serious. Oh, now I'm going on a golf trip. The, the, the Vegas guys trip is now turned into a golf trip across the world, you know, across the US, and then as you, as you get deeper and deeper in the game, the game has a lot more to give, you know, and now you're, now you're traveling, now you're trying to play these iconic courses, now you're thinking about architecture, now you're coming to PGA Tour events you become. A fan, your game gets better, your, your consumer habits change. I think that the sport in general as a as a league can do a lot better at thinking consumer first and if you go to a PGA Tour event now, and this is gonna change under its new leadership, if you go to the PGA Tour now, you know, you can't get access to these fancy hospitality areas unless you're invited guest of AWS so you should ask Tyler afterwards for a badge, uh, so, but think about, you know, the, the other sports experiences and, and Formula One, you know, we're in Vegas. Formula One was just here. Two weeks ago and, and you know if you're a consumer and you want an elevated hospitality experience you can just go and execute, uh, you know, basically exercise your rights as a fan to, to kind of buy your way into the coolest places and be a part of it. I think golf has a huge opportunity to do that. I think the fact that the tournaments take over a town for a whole week, create different moments of programming to reach all those different audiences, I think what the tour is trying to do at making it more competitive, more scarce, and, and more simple is gonna be, is gonna pay dividends as the as the league has to basically understand that you can't just live on. On speaking of CMOs and CTOs only, you've gotta, you gotta reach big sports fans. So how do you, how do you make the league as competitive as possible and you make the scarcity such that every single shot matters and that's what makes the majors so good in golf. And obviously Amanda, you know, calls, uh, uh, she's there at half of them, half of them, and, uh, and you know, the my favorite one, and, and it matters. Every shot matters at the Masters. The whole week is this buildup, and I think that, uh, you know, that that is because it's, it's the most fan first event in golf. It is, you know. As as crazy as that sounds, you know, as inaccessible as Augusta National can be as a fan, it's the greatest fan experience. You're, you're free of there's no phones, you're walking, they give you every information, it's a beautiful place. I think that what they've been able to do to kind of capture fan attention and then capture the world's attention during the week of the tournament is something you're gonna see more and more out of the PGA Tour, um, and you know, hopefully our job and my job at our company is to help kinda continue to put golf into pop culture and, and continue to kind of push its relevance and, and make it part of that fabric of what. Young people are talking about just like the latest movie release or the latest record release they're talking about golf now and, and that's an amazing place. If you would have asked me 10 years ago if that's where we would've been when I was trying to pitch, you know, full swing, you know, I remember the, the Netflix execs asked like, be honest, is there any drama in pro golf? And I was like, well, sometimes, you know, people break the rules, you know, they get in arguments over lies and stuff like that. And then of course year one we have the live schism and. You know, the most drama of any sport, probably, so, you know, I'm, I'm really bullish on the future of golf. I think the, uh, the uniting of the kind of consumer boom that we're seeing with what's happening in the pro game all enabled by great technology that helps casual fans understand what's happening. Ultimately that's what simplicity is like. There's no simpler sport than soccer. Ball goes in net, you get a point. Like, how do you make golf easy to follow? How do you set the stage, because you have all this downtime to build context, to build story. And again, I don't think there's anything more exciting than watching a ball flying through the air and seeing the, the, the, you know, the next crane. And that pop when a when a ball lands next to the hole when it really matters and it's all about the storytelling and the context that you set to make those moments matter and have more of those throughout a professional season. Also, the new leadership he's talking about, uh, our new CEO came from the NFL. He was Roger Goodell's right hand man. I can't imagine a better person. This guy has seen it all. He's done it all. He understands the business of the biggest sport in the in the world, really. I mean, you, you look, it's the NFL is a different beast than anything else, so to have that big of an idea and understanding of what it takes to make things work and then come into the PGA Tour, I think he's going to be, you're going to see a lot of changes very quickly in a very positive way. Well, this is the last thing to add on that, I think when you know when I first. Pitched them on the PGA, uh, on, uh, full swing. It was actually funny you mentioned 2011 when Amanda first started working for PGA Tour.com. I was also down there in 2011. PGA Tour smartly was trying to get smarter about digital, and I was working at a digital media company called Vox Media back then, and I led a little del I mean, one, I'm a golf nerd if you can't tell, absolute golf like sicko and wonk, uh, but I led this, uh, delegation down there to help them sort of rethink how to reach a digital audience, and at the time it was like, how do we reach millennials. Now millennials have got a bunch of gray hair. Now we're old. Now we're old, uh, but the two things I pitched them was you should start a new channel, a new digital channel that can carry a lot more voice than you would be able to do without that PGA Tour badge, but give it rights and create a new brand around that. And the second thing is you can't ride Tiger's coattails forever, so you gotta turn your next generation of stars into stars. And these, these are players that, that haven't had the media walls built around them in the same way that Tiger has, and they grew up. You know, sort of on social media and they're a little more open to stuff, uh, and, and so they said no to both things and went on and created Scratch, which we now own, which is funny, and then it took another 9 years to finally talk them into doing full swing, but, but that's ultimately what the tour has to do is turn these these amazing athletes that they have into superstars and the way to do that is more access, more context, bring fans closer, and I think golf has a huge advantage in some ways over the NFL because players aren't wearing. Helmets, it's easy to create a superstar golfer. If you look at the most famous athletes in history and the richest athletes in history, like 3 or 4 of them are golfers Jack Nicholas, Arnold Palmer, Tiger Woods, Phil Nicholson, some of the highest grossing athletes in history, and it's it's because their face, you know, they're on camera up close, um, you know, every single weekend. So, you know, I think golf has a tremendous opportunity. I thought we were going Messi, Beckham. I thought we were going all soccer at that time when you were gonna say that. Oh yeah, yeah, those guys too, probably those guys are pretty famous. They're they're doing all right, but, but no, it's a. There's a huge advantage there and I think the tour has uh has the ingredients it needs to kind of bring it bridge the gap into the future and especially as we look at, you know, the next iteration of where golf will be consumed, you know, starting in the 2030s and in this kind of new over the top ecosystem of kind of reaching fans where they are. I think it's, it couldn't be more exciting to be in golf. I'm lucky I get to hang out with you guys and Amanda. She's always been one of my favorites, been a part of full swing since season one, making us look smart, uh. So, uh, you know, we're honestly just excited to be here and happy to answer your questions. I don't know if we're gonna question, yeah, but no, thank you for. I mean, as a golf to go myself, I am incredibly encouraged and excited about the future of golf and awesome to hear both of your, like, am I the only one up here holding it down for the golf casual fan? Listen, someone has to do it. It's gonna be me, I guess, yeah, you're the most important audience. A couple of minutes left for any questions we might have. So if you have a question, go ahead and throw your hands up and somebody will come, I think, with microphones in the back to. Deliver, is that you? Any questions out there? I saw a couple of hands over here. Yeah, and over here. Hi, I was wondering if we could revisit your comments about the live schism. It seems like a lot of golf strategy that you've discussed today is about capturing saturated markets in geographies that already are aware of the game. How do you balance that with expansion into new territory? I guess that's for me since I was the one who brought uplift you, um, you know, I think golf's growing internationally as well, uh, not as much or as rapidly as it's growing in the US, but it's definitely growing internationally. I, I think, look, I don't run the PGA Tour. I have a company that, that has the rights still with the tour, so I, I, I can't say what the PGA Tour thinks. I, I personally think that the Olympics is gonna be the greatest advertisement for global golf over the next 10 years. We, we, I have a podcast that we just talk a bunch of like. Sitting around after a round of golf, that's kind of the one of the things we talk about is what, what is the best chance of being the 5th major, and I would say that's the Olympics. I think that you're gonna see golf in the Southern Hemisphere, which you've never really get to see other than, you know, this weekend at the at Royal Melbourne. Um, you get international audiences wrapped up in the context of nationalism and tribalism, which creates fandom. It's easy to make it binary. I'm, I'm for us versus them. That's what makes the Ryder Cup so compelling. And so I think the Olympics is gonna do more for global golf than any other initiative. I think Augusta National obviously has taken, made it, made a huge priority to reach out to other territories. They have their, uh, international, the Asian. I do that, the Pacific Asia Amateur, um, Asia Pacific. AAC Asia Pacific Amateur Championship. I do that one every year and the Latin American and the Latin America championship, and you can, you are literally seeing the growth in places like Oman and Iraq and Iran. Um, we were just in Dubai, so in the UAE, how, how golf is really starting to catch on and expand, uh, that's certainly helping, but to your point, I think what Liv has done very well is they are bringing golf to these golf hungry places, right? Like Australia is. Obsessed with their golf, that sandbelt has some of the top golf courses in the world, and the PGA Tour doesn't even snip it unless we're going there for a President's Cup, right? So what did Liv say? They're like, Oh, of course with their former leader with Greg Norman, they're like, we're going to go back to Australia and New Zealand and give these people what they want, and it's by far their most lucrative golf tournament, right? So to your point, there are places clearly that the PGA Tour needs to do a better job of continuing to grow and to hit on those fan bases who feel like we love. Game more than anybody. Why are you depriving us, depriving us of, um, a professional, a professional tournament? But to that same point, you see the NFL and how they're growing. You can't do it all, all at once, right? So you have to progressively pick and choose your places, um, on where you're going to scale, where you're going to grow, and I think as we're seeing this unprecedented growth right here in the United States, it would be a big miss to not continue to hit the United States as hard as possible right now. So that we don't lose uh those people who are so newly interested in the game. Well, that's what I was gonna say. You mentioned saturation. I think we, we may have a saturation of golf golfers or golf curious people in the United States, but the PGA Tour needs to gain share on these other leagues. That's, I mean, that's the ultimate goal. Like how much of those the 35 to 40 million golf curious or golf interested people can you turn into regular viewers? Like that's the opportunity. And so that yes, the golfer might be saturated, but the share of that audience that's tuning into. The PGA Tour is, is, there's still tons of upside there. The other thing I'd point out too is, uh, you know, the DP World Tour and, and their embrace of sort of national opens, and you've seen like Rory really make that a priority, you know, now that he's got his Grand Slam and he's won the Masters. I think, you know, playing in India, playing in, in, uh, Ireland, playing in Scotland, like India was an unbelievable win for the entire game of golf. That was unreal. Yeah, so you see these elevation and especially as the PGA Tour, you know, who knows what the schedule is gonna look like, but you could see that fall. When the NFL is kind of taking all of the spotlight in the United States, some of the best players in the world traveling to play abroad in these national opens and the sort of re-elevation of national opens. I still want to predict that the Olympics is gonna do more than any of it, uh, because I think it's gonna mean more to these players to win the Olympics now that you've looked at the winners that we've had, you know, Justin Rose, um, Xander, Scotty, uh, Scotty, yep, like it, it's, so anyway, make the guess on what's the 5th major in 20 years. My guess is gonna say it's the Olympics. I think we have time for maybe one more question and we gotta hand up. I, as a, uh, fellow golf sicko, um, I, um, I kind of followed the story of Grant getting the sponsor's exemption to, uh, I think it was the Barracuda Barracuda. And uh his decline, right, because he couldn't put it on his channel, you know, I'm curious, you know, with the success of like the Creator Classic and involving these guys in those, in those events, is the tour like warming up to that idea because I mean, you know, what better way to get more people to tune into the, to the main broadcast than actually have some of these really exceptional. I, I will play devil's advocate here for a second. One, I think that plays, it's a great example of what I was saying, how the demand has changed, right? Grant doesn't need the PGA Tour. The fact that he turned down, uh, an exemption, which is such a highly coveted role, um, such a coveted spot because it couldn't go on his channel, and he wants to obviously do everything he can to elevate his channel. The fact that he could turn that down says a lot. A lot about where we're at in the game of golf, uh, on the flip side, the rights holders need to be protected, right? You would never see the NFL give up the rights to a game to an influencer. It just can't happen. You have to protect your brand. That's not to say that you can't bring in influencers and people who have a huge following into an NFL game, into a PGA Tour event, but. You know, you think about we, CBS Sports, we pay hundreds of millions of dollars to be the rights holders of these events. I would be furious if all of a sudden someone's given a spot and they are now broadcasting, uh, the same tournament that my network has paid hundreds of millions of dollars and has invested countless hours, so much technology to bring to the fan, right? I, I'm not saying that's the right answer, but I'm saying that's. We're at right now that there has to be um that we've got to do a little bit more massaging in terms of the landscape. You can't just say, hey Grant, we're gonna give you an exemption and by the way we're gonna turn the keys over to something that uh this whole network has invested their entire livelihood on, right? It just, it doesn't work that way yet. I'd be interested to hear your perspective like how do you get there? What does that look like. I don't know, but as a traditional broadcaster, I'm like, oh, I don't, I don't love that idea of these guys coming in and just being able to do whatever they want. What's the point then in us paying what we pay to, to be the exclusive rights holder of that tournament? It's always a good fan, uh, first thing to be like, let's protect the corporate rights holder. No, I'm kidding, but it matters, right? Protecting the brand matters. Yeah, that's completely, I mean, it's the underpinning of the whole model of the sport, so you can't, you can't break those contracts. I look. I think that the tour would have let him post on his channel like a recap of the whole event. They would have said, you can have cameras filming. We're gonna give you all of our footage. You can have your guys like right inside the ropes or right outside the ropes, whatever video you make playing in this thing, you can have your highlights. Well, they, I think again, I don't wanna put words in their mouths, but that's what we, we did that for the Creator Classic. So I think I think that's accurate for the barracuda, um, so who knows why he said no, you know, it might have been he just liked the attention and wanted to see if it was. It was something that his fans were excited about and then I, I, I think he wanted to live stream during the tournament, right? I think that was the, yeah, that was, that was the break. He's like a live simulcast on his channel and you're like, you know, you can't break the model for, for any, any influencer, honestly, and, uh, and I will say the tour like they did change their rules about social media posts. So now, you know, when there was a big complaint when the live thing happened that players didn't have the ability to post their highlights on their own channels, that's all changed now they can. And that narrative gets trotted out a lot, but it is completely true that like if Rory McIlroy had a YouTube channel, he could post his highlights on that channel like the day after, you know, and none of those guys, they're trying to win golf tournaments. They're not focused on their YouTube, which maybe they should be, by the way, more, uh, like look what Bryson's done, uh, and some are taking it more seriously. So anyway, it's, I, I think we're in this interesting place, as Amanda said, where, you know, a guy like Grant doesn't necessarily need the PGA Tour, um, but. Is a guy like Grant gonna be around in 20 years? Like, who knows, you know, the PGA Tours has to be around in 20 years, you know that that's like it's an existential question for them and how do they balance reaching those new fans, getting people interested in these smaller events that could use an audience pop for sure like the Barracuda would, um, and do it in a way that doesn't break the model. So, well, and I think the NFL has done the best job out of any sport of bringing in influencers and people from the outside while still protecting. The brand right protecting the shield. There is no, there is no sports organization that protects. Their own product more than the NFL. The amount of rules that there are, like, even as a sideline reporter for the NFL, I'm not allowed to, I'm not allowed to post a lot of things from the sidelines, right? Like the NFL, even though we're the rights holders and I'm there broadcasting the game for CBS, you know, for an NFL game, I'm not allowed to do 90% of the stuff that I'm allowed to do on the PGA Tour. So I, I think it's easy to say just because maybe golf's a little bit smaller and we're obviously trying to reach a bigger audience that like, hey, you should get. in more. I don't know if that's necessarily the truth when it comes to being inside the ropes during tournament time that everything outside of that is totally fair game and everything you want to collect during those times and then post after, I, I think is fair game as well. So I think it's just that balance. I mean, live sports is, is still the underpinning of the entire media ecosystem essentially, and it's the one place where we get as close as possible to like mono culture these days, you know, it used to be we all sit around and watch Seinfeld. Sorry, I was aging myself, um, but live sports. Is is the kind of underpinning of this entire ecosystem and so you know the live component I think is, is, is has to be sacrosanct and has to be protected but also um you gotta surround that with stuff so people understand what the context is, what makes it exciting, what makes it thrilling, because it really is you cannot recreate the excitement of live sports when amazing sports things happen and that's what we always talk about, you know, again, not come back to full swing, but like Matt Fitzpatrick winning the US Open, like the greatest sports moment I've ever stood and watched because we've been following him all season, he was like such a long shot to win. And it just sports has this way of writing stories that you could never script and and I think that's what that's what gives it its relevance that's why we're sitting here at this amazing conference and talking about live sports because ultimately it it is the thing that you can't write and people, you know, in a world where more and more feeds are being customized for you and everybody's content is customized for them and that's only gonna get more. More you know engagement driven by you know AI content creation and customizing and all those algorithms the fact that we can all share an experience watching live sports is one of the few things we have left where we can do that. So thank you both for being here. Chad, thank you Amanda, thank you so much for being here. Unfortunately we're out of time for questions. I would talk about golf all day if I could, but we are uh.
