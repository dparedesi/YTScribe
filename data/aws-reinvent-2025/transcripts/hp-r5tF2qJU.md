Thank you all for joining in. My name is uh Gurrinder Raju, and I'm gonna be talking to you today about how workspaces is powering the future. Of work And I'll be joined by a great cast of uh speakers. I'll be joined by Ray, who's gonna talk about what's new in workspaces and what are the newer capabilities that we added to the product. That you should be excited about and incorporating in your workload? I'll be joined by uh Cody from Deloitte who is gonna talk about. How Deloitte uses workspaces at scale, and how workspaces enables Deloitte to meet the needs of multiple different personas. And uh I'll be joined by uh Robert Green from Vision, who's gonna talk about how Vision is using, using multiple workspace intelligence features to build agentic capabilities and boost the productivity of their end users and admits. And towards the end, I'll come back to the future of work and uh have a discussion with you on what are the patterns that are changing, and what is that we are building to define and drive the future of work. Uh, you don't want to miss that out. Um. And if you stay a little bit longer, I'll be around to answer any of the questions and maybe show you a cool couple demo demo or two to see that what's cooking. All of you have been going through an unprecedented pace of change, and it's a little bit unique to end-user computing because it's at the intersection of so many things. Computing, virtualization, cybersecurity, data center exits, agentic AI, you know, uh, agents, frontier agents, productivity, right? And uh. I can relate to, I met so many customers that we talked about there's just too much changing, right? And uh let's pick up the first change from this unprecedented pace of changes that you have been tackling, which is the increase in On-premise virtualization software. 2X, 3X, 5X, 10X, in many cases more, and this is creating real pressure on you to accelerate the exit of the data centers that you might still have some workloads running in. It doesn't stop there. You have been tackling major life cycle events both on software, operating system versions and hardware versions. And it's very time-consuming and expensive, especially when it gets coupled with The, uh, the cost unpredictability that I talked about in the previous slide. Keeps going, you know, Agentic AI is accelerating across the entire industry and, uh, as you heard in Matt's keynote and also Andy commented about it is we at Amazon believe that it's gonna yield and deliver remarkable results. And I see that in my own team, my product and engineering teams. Uh, and have incorporated that in their daily work, and I'm loving the increased pace that I see on a daily basis. All of you are being asked by your leaders to incorporate agentic AI. So you are tackling this along with the OS life cycle version events and the cost and predictability. With great power comes great responsibility, right? Like with the agentic AI increase, you are having to tackle a new surface area of uh threat vectors, you know, um, prompt injection. Many of your end users, many of your employees knowingly, unknowingly, you know, uh, leaking some of your confidential information to chatbots or other online GII tools, and it's not good. So you're having to rethink the tools you use to tackle these, right? Um, it's a lot of changes that you're adapting to. I, I, I wanna show, do a show of hands, right? Like, on how many of you actually relate to it. Yeah, yeah, you're telling me the story. That's how my last 12 months or 18 months have been. Just do a show of hands. You know Many hands showing up and then you're not alone, you know, and I'll chat with you, I'll talk about on how workspaces is enabling you to navigate the, the space of change uh with the capabilities uh uh that we have. Before I do that, I'll just quickly refresh your mind about the portfolio of products that we have under the Workspaces brand. You have a full virtual desktop available to you, persistent, non-persistent. You have uh application only virtualization. We have our own purpose-built streaming protocol that we obsess on and keep investing in to deliver a delightful end user experience. We have thin client devices for lightweight endpoints. We have a secure browser. If all your end users use SAS applications, it's a great option for you. And then of course, uh, you know, beyond all the. Uh, native products that we have, we also give you the capability with the Workspace's core to bring your preferred end user and admin experience, uh, to Workspace's infrastructure. Let's go through one by one, a little more detail, right? Start with desktops. Workspaces gives you the option of Windows and operating, Windows and Linux operating system choices. Client OS, server OS, we have the broadest selection of Linux flavors across any cloud provider. Um, And then you can use them in multiple configurations. Tuning and tuning it for the workload that you have with the persistent desktop, with non-persistent desktop. You can. Uh, we are present in, uh, 20 regions and counting. Over the next 9 to 18 months, you will see that we'll be globally expanding, which means that any new region that AWS launches will also be present at the day of the launch or soon after. Uh, We support the different identity choices that, uh, you know, and then you can pick the identity choice, whether it's a cloud directory or it's a, uh, on-premise directory, and then we give you the option of a variety of bundle sizes, whether it's storage, compute, networking, and you can tune it to the needs that you have. Um, We support multiple differentiating features, Amazon Global Accelerator, which routes the end user traffic to the Amazon fiber as quickly as possible, and we have multi-region resiliency, which gives you options for business continuity and have a real tangible disaster recovery plan. So between persistent and non-persistent desktops, varied bundle sizes, global region availability and flexible identity choices, it's a very versatile, scalable desktop infrastructure for you. Let's move to application streaming. Not everyone needs the full desktop experience. Not one of your end users need a start menu, and many of your end users just work on a select set of applications, and you can, you can use you can use Workspace's applications, previously called AppStream, to give them an app-only experience and. Tens of thousands of our customers have used this to sacsify their native applications and make them instantly accessible to their end users all over the world, just like a web app, right? And this model helps with the distribution challenge. No more complex software installations, right, like a native app applications become available just like a URL. Again, I talked about the disparate protocol. Delightful end user experience is super important, and this is the backbone of all the products and services that you see here, and we continue making foundational investments. This is our in-house, our own DCV protocol. We also give you choices for thin clients, not only our own thin client, but from partners as well, and then this gives you the option to decouple the operating system from the client device. You can have a powerful desktop in the cloud, and then you can have a very lightweight thin client device. I talked about the uh the secure browser. This is this is very compelling, and over time we have innovated on very persona specific solutions, right, and secure browser starts at $7 a user a month and for your end users who are primarily using SAS applications, this is a great, great choice. And of course, All the other capabilities that I talked about. We also give you the choice of bringing your own preferred admin and end user experience, and then make it run in the cloud on AWS and Workspace's reliant infrastructure. So in summary, you get a comprehensive toolkit of solutions. Continue moving then, you know, how does it talk, how does it help solve the challenges that we talked about earlier, you know. Workspace's core gives you access of the complete feature set of your partner, you know, and um You can bring your workload without changes. So if you're getting pressure from your leadership to accelerate data center exit, this is a great, great tool for you. Talked about OS Lifecycle, hundreds of thousands of end users are running already on Windows 11 workspaces in the cloud on our services, and uh across the workspaces, pools and personal, both. So, we've enabled these. End users to onboard onto Windows 11 with our in-built migrate APIs, moving from a previous version to a new version, and many of these customers actually continue relying on their previous hardware, moving their full powered desktop to the cloud by keeping and keeping their endpoint and client devices very simple. Agentic AI accelerated agentic AI adoption, right? We, behind the scenes have built multiple Intelligence capabilities, many of them are visible to you, many of them are not visible to you, and uh customers are leveraging them. You'll see an example of that later today when uh when Vision talks about how they are using it to build Agentic AI capabilities. And then last, new cybersecurity threat vector surface that has emerged. And then uh just to give you an example, like a defense agency in Asia Pacific rolled out secure browser to the tens of thousands of users, you know, to protect themselves against threats like prompt injection and uh you know, unintentional leakage of data through any of the chat chat, you know, chatbots and GAI tools. Pixel streaming gives you ephemeral access to the browser, which is completely isolated from the client device, and it gives you great protection against these cybersecurity threats. These are not the only challenges we help you with. We have been innovating for a decade. And uh, you know. Innovating by introducing new pricing models. Workspaces when GA in 2014, we launched the RE model soon after that, and uh we give you continued and increased selection of both client OS, server OS, Linux choices, you know, and uh as I said, we keep innovating based upon the persona. One size does not fit all, and we don't want you to overprovision. To that, we launched Tapstream in 2016, and we launched uh Secure Browser uh somewhere late 2020, 2021. The pace is only accelerating. You know, and if you look at the last 3 years, there are so many favorite features that I have that I've been very, very deeply, uh, connected to in launching, right? The selection keeps on increasing. We have launched new versions of Linux, Rocky, Ral, Ubuntu, launched uh Multi-region Resilience, Amazon Global Accelerator for faster, uh, you know, end user experience. And we launched Workspace's core. A conferencing is optimized across all major vendors. What does it mean? With this accelerated pace of innovation, we, AWS is recognized as a leader in desktop as a service by Gartner for the 2nd year in a row, you know, and uh it's a I would say it's a great testimonial to our capabilities and obsession and our continued perseverance in innovating in this area for the last 10 years. With that, I will hand over to Ray, who will go through some of these newer features in a bit more detail. And uh thank you, Ray. Thank you, thank you, Grinder. All right. Hello. Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Rai Wang. I lead one of the product management teams in Amazon workspaces focusing on end user experience. So today, I'm excited to share with you uh some of the uh recent launches that we made this year. Uh, you know, Amazon workspaces, uh, service customers across different industry segments, right? So from assembly lines to the trading floor, from hospitals to the, uh, uh, government agencies, workspaces has become the trusted solution for many of our customers across a diverse set of cases. We're always looking to hear from you and learn from our customers about their unique needs. So even after this session, we'll be happy to talk to you about your needs, how we can iterate on workspaces to, to uh meet your needs better. Right. As you can see from here, organizations of all sizes trust workspaces with their desktop and application streaming needs. These logos represent more than just customers to us. To us, they're our partners in innovation, right? They help us to continue to refine workspaces to meet the evolving demands of uh enterprise, uh, modern work, workplaces. All right. So let's talk about our 2025 launches, right? 2025 has been a great year for our workspaces. We made some headways across security, performance, and usability. All right, let's start, let's dive into a few areas where we made some strides this year. Let's start with delivering delightful end user experience. what does that mean, right? A delightful end user experience to us means that the virtual desktops and or the application should feel very responsive and natural, just like the physical one. If a user can use their local laptop to do something, we feel like they should be able to do the exact same thing, maybe even better with their workspaces, even under challenging network conditions. So this year, you know, to deliver this delightful end user experience, we first improved our peripheral support. We launched generic USB redirection for some to help users use some of these common uh USB devices such as payment devices or uh uh barcode scanners that takes care of a variety of use cases that have peripheral needs. We also added support for webau redirection, uh, which allows users to use security keys such as UBKs or even Windows Hello within their workspaces session. And in addition, we have collaborated with Wacom, the industry's leading professional drawing tablet maker. Uh, to give professional artists such as, uh, visual effects artists or, uh, yeah, different professional artists, uh, a way to use Wacom tablets and all the special features they have in their Wacom tablets, plus their Wacom pens all within their workspaces seamlessly under ultra low latency, right? So this is something called Wacom Bridge that uh we have launched with them. Uh, in addition, right, for audio and video workloads like web conferencing, we have collaborated closely with Microsoft this year to launch a public preview of Teams optimization for VDI. This feature offloads the team's audio and video packets from the remote workspaces host to your local client and significantly reduces the CPU and memory consumption. In addition to that, we also improved international keyboard support. Now, with special languages like Hebrew or languages with dead keys, users can seamlessly type whatever they want in their workspaces. And lastly, we launched a feature called client auto update. This makes it super easy for users to get the latest features and security updates from workspaces without any administrative intervention. All right. On the networking, networking front, uh, we also integrated with Amazon Global Accelerator, so AGA. Uh, this dramatically improves connection stability and performance worldwide across the globe. This means fewer dropped connections, more smooth streaming experience, and more consistent end user experience. Even for remote workers living in like challenging network environments. The second major, major area of innovation for us is um global selection and presence. Our customers have told us that they would like more flexibility, especially regarding the compute and storage options associated with workspaces, right? So they want to use the latest and greatest from EC2 instances that can exactly match their applications need while keeping the cost in check. So this year, we're happy to announce that we're, we have launched 175 new instance types for workspaces applications. Uh, including the latest compute optimized, memory optimized, and accelerated instance types. For storage, we also increase to up to 500 gigabytes of desk storage, up from 200. And most importantly, we launched a new feature that allows you to import your own image to workspaces applications. A lot of our customers have told us that they uh have their own golden image CICD pipeline or they have their custom tools that helps them to maintain the freshness of those image and keeps them updated. Now you can keep all of uh image pipelines and then export those when you're ready and import them into workspaces applications. This greatly reduces the manual operational efforts that admins had to do previously to use workspaces applications. Lastly, we also introduced 4 new regions support, which brings the total number of regions across the globe to 20 for workspaces applications. And that's not all, right? So global presence and selection is also important for the customers that want to use our partner solutions like Citrix DS with workspace's infrastructure. So this year, we launched a new feature called Workspace's core Managed Instances. Uh, With this, this greatly simplified VDI deployment for these kind of customers, allowing them to use highly customizable instance configurations, including almost all the EC2 instance types that you can think of, right? And they can do it all within the security and governance um boundaries of their uh own AWS account. So this is great news for those customers as well. All right. And lastly, another area of focus for us this year is with our secure browser product. For secure browser, we first made significant performance improvements in session start time. Uh, we, uh, up to 50% more, uh, faster, reducing the friction of launching secure browser session, sessions. You know, our new two-bar configurability also allows organizations to customize the user experience, uh, while maintaining security control, right? We also launched CloudWatch metrics for secure browser, allowing the admins, giving them the visibility they need to, uh, into the customer um end user usage patterns and also potentially security events. Most importantly, On the security front, we also introduced three features this year, inline reduction for sensitive content, web content filtering, and session logging. These, uh, combination of these three features allowed IT admins to maintain control over the potential data exfiltration, uh, uh, risks. All right. With that, I will hand it over to Corey from Deloitte to talk about how they leverage these workspaces innovations for different personas in Deloitte. All right, thanks, Ray. Hello, my name's Corey Weeden. I'm a senior cloud engineer at Deloitte. Oh, there it is. Um, I work primarily on our VDI team supporting our AWS workspaces environment. Today I wanna talk to you about our journey to workspaces. So let's start with who are we, right? Some of you guys are probably coming from Fortune 500 companies, maybe uh, a US based company, um, maybe even you're coming from Deloitte. Um, but there's probably a good chance either way that you've probably come across the green dot at some point, right? And why is that? It's because nearly 90% of Fortune 500 companies trust Deloitte, and we are also supporting over 8500 US based firms. Right. So Deloitte employs about 180,000, maybe more US employees all around the world. So with that, there's a need for virtual desktops. So what did it look like before we had workspaces? Well, our team was supporting 7 on-prem environments, right? And if you have, or if you've had an on-prem VDI environment, you're probably familiar with some of the challenges, right? Operational overhead, hardware that you have to manage yourself, doing your own OS upgrades, server patching, compliance, you name it, right? And our personal favorite, the chargeback model, right? What does that look like? How do we charge our users? Do we just give them a flat rate? Do we try and estimate, you know, if you don't know what your environment's gonna look like in 6 to 12 months, how do you estimate how much each machine costs, right? So then There it is in, uh, 2020, right? COVID hits. And everyone gets sent home, right? But not only are people now working from home, we still have our new hires that are being on boarded. We also have our intern programs that are still running. We also have just your everyday break fix situations. So how do we do that when we have a supply chain bottleneck when it's hard to get physical assets, right? So we needed a lot of virtual desktops, and we needed them quickly, right? So in comes workspaces, right? A fully managed service that we could use to scale out seamlessly and quickly. With workspaces, we didn't have to worry about the, the hardware management, right? We don't have to do our own server patches or upgrades or anything like that anymore, and we don't have to worry about how much space are we gonna need in 6 months or how quickly can we rack and stack more hardware to get that space available. Amazon handles that for us, right? So Workspaces give us the ability to scale up, scale out, and we can do it globally across 8 regions, all from the same pane, all in the same console, right? But who, who uses workspaces, right? At the way we have a lot of different personas, we have a lot of different types of people using, uh, workspaces, you know, from your daily task worker or maybe it's an executive who just needs to log in to check their email or maybe join a Teams call, right? Maybe we have project teams that are using workspaces for their contractors. Maybe they don't have time to ship a laptop across the globe to get their contract work and they need to start work today. We also have a lot of developers who are using workspaces as their secure development environment, right? So we give them a full-blown 8 CPU machine and they can have their own development environment. Our, how, how can we deploy all these machines so quickly, right? In the heart of COVID when everyone needs a virtual machine right away, our development teams were able to create a self-service provisioning process to where no matter where you are in the world or whatever time in the world it is, you didn't have to wait for the US team to wake up or submit a ticket and wait for the ticketing process to get a workspace, you could deploy your own machine. And at the heart of COVID, I think our team was supporting north of 15,000 workspaces, but that was just for personal. Today our team is supporting workspaces personal, secure browser, and even pooled, and that just gives us the ability to fulfill even more use cases across the company. And in in partnership with AWS we've we've come up with a simpler workflow, a smoother workflow to create and manage our existing workspace images, and that's helped us in a couple areas like our Windows 11 migration and onboarding Ubuntu workspaces for our Linux friends. We've also started exploring a simpler authentication flow, a, a more modern identity alignment with tra ID workspaces. We have enhanced observability with Project Hawkeye, and of course, if you haven't heard about it already, we're trying, we are exploring the capabilities of workspaces and how we can develop, enhance and optimize the next AI capability, right? And so with that, I will turn it over to Gariner. Thank you, Cody. Thank you. As you can see, this is my favorite slide, right? I'm incorporating it for the 2nd time. Like, I like this so much because this, you know, shows and presents the work of the team. It shows the accelerated pace of what we are doing for our customers and how it enables customers like Deloitte to leverage our solutions and meet the needs of demanding needs of different personas that they take care of, right? So I talked about how we started early on, kinda, you know, introducing new pricing models, uh, newer selection, and, uh, uh, you know, newer solutions for each price to performance point and different personas that you need workspaces, secure browser, application, uh, streaming with uh with AppStream. And since then, the kind of pace has accelerated, right? Like identity choices, networking, uh, features, and user features, enabling you to, you know, uh, use cloud Directory, multi-region resilience, uh, AGA. There are 4 features in here that I like to particularly call out, right? If you see kind of the dancing boxes, right, like, I think those are the 4 that I'll call out, which kind of gives me a good segue into the next section. These four features are Workspace's core, when we launched it in, uh, like I think 3 years ago, around kind of 2022, and enabling you to bring your M365 applications onto workspaces, the entire workspace's suite of products. The third one is the image onboarding improvements that we've done where we use AI behind the scenes to self-heal a lot of the issues that might be there in the image that would have otherwise required a lot of work to be done by you. And we launched Workspace's core managed instances earlier this year to give you the full selection of, uh, you know, uh, your partner feature set and the best of AWS, right? Together, these features help you. These features help us to meet you where you are and accelerate the move from your on-premise environments and uh moving on to cloud-enabled fully managed solutions, you know, on a, on a digital workplace. So, We have multiple partners who have integrated with Workspace's core, right? Like with Citrix and Omnisa, you have, we have coverage and you have coverage of vast majority of on-premise workloads, you know, and uh which you could migrate to, uh, you know, the AWSN workspace's infrastructure. And with WorkSpot, LeoStream, and Vision, this gives you a fully managed. Digital workplace solution powered by workspaces and AWS. So, the next section I want to talk to you about is not only these capabilities, workspace's native capabilities, workspace's partner capabilities, but there's been a lot of innovation that we and the broader AWS have collaborated on, which gives you intelligence capabilities. Like, so, for example, AWS has launched multiple MCPs. Feature set where workspaces, APIs are already integrated for you to build agentic solutions. At the same time, newer agentic applications like uh uh QuickSuite and Quiro are enabling the customers to build, uh, you know, and accelerate uh their own product feature set. So with that, I will hand it over to Robert Green, who is the CEO of Vision to talk about on how they're leveraging these intelligence capabilities and workspaces broadly to boost their end user and admin productivity. Alright, good afternoon. I'm Rob Green, CEO of Vision. Uh, today I'm gonna, uh, show you something with that will hopefully fundamentally change the way you think about desktop as a service. So imagine an AI assistant, uh, that lives inside your desktop, one that actually knows you. It knows your applications, your workflows, your data, uh, your history, not a generic chatbot, a personalized intelligence that understands your context and anticipates your needs. What if your help desk can answer uh an issue before the user puts a ticket in? What if your finance team could ask a simple question and get detailed cloud cost breakdown directly from their desktop? This isn't science fiction, this is what we are working on now. Oops. Hit the wrong button. There we go. Alright, sorry about that. So first, a quick intro in vision. Uh, so we're 14 years old, um, we, we, we're the only vendor managed desk, uh, that combines the enterprise desktops, um, with, uh, instant provisioning. Uh, we, uh, you know, traditional VDI, uh, deployments take about 4 months. Um, we can deliver, uh, secure, compliant virtual desktops in about 4 hours. That's not an incremental improvement, that's a paradigm shift. Our platform is end to end, zero trust access, always on compliance, and everything um in, in between. Built on AWS purpose built for the enterprise. So let me give you a quick tour of our product suite and dive a little bit um into the AI innovation. So our philosophy is uh no assembly required, batteries included. Uh, so we have a DAS platform that is your complete virtual desktop infrastructure, industry leading protocol, automation, unified management. Our cloud PC is our persistent, uh, uh, cloud desktop on AWS, uh, again built for enterprise grade performance. Overwatch monitoring, um, essentially allowing you to be proactive and no problems before your end users do. Um, our Halo, uh, browser isolation, uh, not secure enterprise browser but secure every browser. Um, Security Pulse, which is our comp our continuous compliance automation for HIPPAA, uh, SOC, as well as PCI, and our managed instances which gives us full service or co-managed, um, again, to, to flex to meet what you need. So our new buy now portal is our self-service deployment that allows you to get to production uh even faster. So, um, now here's where it gets really interesting. Uh, let, let me show you what we are uh leveraging Workspace's intelligence to bring Agenic AI to the desktop. So we've integrated workspaces intelligence across 5 key areas. Uh, each one represents a real problem that enterprises struggle with today. And an AI powered solution that's becoming more and more a reality. So the first is self-healing image onboarding. Rapid, reliable, and repeatable process to onboard your OS image, so you can import that image that you've been working on, part of your, your, your, your CICD pipeline or whatever um you've used in the past. Uh, flexibility at every uh uh uh flexibility for your journey. So that really means uh we support core bundles and core managed instances, providing flexibility to use workspaces your way. Vision's AI cloud PC Ask Ray, which I'll be talking about more um after this. Our AI system that lives inside the desktop, users can ask questions, get help, and solve problems without data ever leaving their desktop. Our AI powered troubleshooting, um, correlating logs, metrics, and sessions across across systems takes hours for normal admins. Ray can do it instantly, which I will show, uh, here shortly. And then AI driven cost management, finance teams want cost visibility. We give them democratized access. So here's the secret sauce. Uh, so we've connected Ray, uh, to both workspaces and digit MCP servers. We're giving Ray full context across infrastructure and desktop as a service layers. Ray isn't a separate tool users have to, uh, learn. It is embedded in the desktop experience. Helping users work smarter, not harder. Each user gets personalized assistance, but user A's experience does not impact user B's experience. Um, so here's what sets Ray apart context from every layer. AWS infrastructure, workspaces, vision DS, and the end user's environment. That's not just data, that's intelligence. So let me show you what this looks like in, in, in practice, right? We'll start with the real world experience. So, um, everyone's gotten a support ticket that says, uh, my desktop is, is, is, is frozen, right? That's it, no context, nothing else, my desktop is frozen, and I've got a very frustrated user. In the old world, here's what happens. The tier one asks the user for more details. The user takes about an hour or so to get back, and then tier one escalates it up to tier 2. Tier 2 goes and checks out the logs, um, and then, you know, they may find something and they may not. Days pass, users are still frustrated. In the Ray world, Using simple natural language interaction, Ray goes out, correlates, and, and, and pulls back from the various MCP servers across all the layers with context that talk about session state, performance metrics, recent changes, everything, and does that in minutes, yeah, and not hours. The user says desktop is freezing. Ray translates that into a multi-system uh diagnostic query that correlates the data and delivers actionable insights in minutes, not hours. So let me double click into it to kind of show you behind the scenes. So this is leveraging Quiro as you can see on the screen. Um, so it's Monday morning, users are complaining about slow desktops. Your admin opens up Overwatch, uh, sees the graphs, right, opens in, it then goes to the AWS console, opens up cloud watch metrics, cross references with recent changes, looks at network telemetry. 40 to 60 minutes later they find a root cause. Or they can just ask Ray. Um, and if we look under the hood using Quiro, you can see the vision, um, Vision Ray actually goes in and and leverages both Vision MCP servers and Workspace's MCP servers to investigate the root cause. Ray sees everything in the admin would, um, would have to correlate manually, but they see it instantly. But Ray doesn't just stop at, at, at correlating data, it finds a solution, um and um it prevents the problem from happening in the future. This is not about replacing admins though. This is about giving admins a uh Iron Man suit, allowing them to spend more time doing strategic work versus correlating and troubleshooting. So now let me show you something that that will make the finance team happy. So here's a scenario, um, it plays out in every enterprise. Your finance team needs cost breakdown, um, for their, their cloud spin. They don't have AWS console access and nor should they. Um, so the, that non-technical user from their desktop in finance asks a simple question in natural language, and Ray connects to the AWS, uh, and, and Workspace's MCP servers, pulls the data and responds with a clear cost breakdown, uh, with insights. But here's where it gets really, really interesting, um. Ray asks, do you want me to automate that for you next month? User says, sure, and then Ray will automatically generate a script and ensure that that report is on his on their desktop for the next month. So, seeing is believing. So I put together a very, very quick video. It's gonna, it's gonna go by very quickly, but this is um kind of going over those three use cases that I just talked about. So first we're gonna show how Ray is interact allows users to interact with their desktop. So interact with their files, interact with um asking things about the files, interacting um and allowing that user to pull back data very quickly as well as open up files. So, and this is just one use case, Ray can can do a multitude of things on the desktop and make and again allow that end user to have that superpower. So at the end here it's gonna uh open up a file. There you go. So in the second use case we talked about um you know the finance use case, where they, they, the finance non-technical user in simple language, ask a question. And I'm showing you the back end, so obviously this is kind of showing the verbose mode, but it goes through, pulls out the data, correlates the data, creates insights, and then visualizes it. And then automatically creates a script to automate it going forward. So the final use case is Ray can take a trouble ticket again, going back to that, you know, that my desktop is frozen. Correlate that to the multiple layers, so that's the AWS layer, the vision layer, the workspaces layer, and actually correlate all the components that that could go into making up that desktop for monitoring, Overwatch, as well as cloudwatch and then pull back a solution and the problem, excuse me, the root cause as well as the solution in a matter of minutes. Now this is drastically sped up for our demonstration, but uh it's still a matter of minutes to get to the root cause, and that's my time. Thank you so much, Rob. Um, it's so cool to see. Um, It's so cool to see vision using workspaces and broader AWS capabilities and Kiiro and, uh, you know, like Workspaces API is integrated into um The AWS MCP servers enabling these capabilities, enabling these kind of gentic features. I wanna talk about the future of work, right? Like, where are things going? Uh, and what is workspaces building to define, drive it, and what is that you should be thinking about while making your choices in how you design your digital workplace strategy and shape it, actively shape it. I want to take you through how the era of applications has evolved. So it's a little bit of a sneak preview or kind of a like a walk back on how these application frameworks, desktops started, right? Like the first era was native applications. These applications are built in, um, ah, you know, uh, like interacting deeply with the operating system in, uh, languages, C. You know, or uh C++. And there is a very clear boundary on what's remote, what's local, and the end user uses a desktop that's local and connects to either desktops or applications. This is kind of, uh, I think a lot of that, you, a lot of it, you will relate to it. This is the native era of applications, right? Um. These applications had deep performance capabilities because you are able to use the operating system, but you require very fine-grained management on updating them, version management of it, you know, and your end user is required to install them, so it's not controlled, distribution is not controlled by you. How did this evolve? This evolved into the set of applications where distribution is a lot easier, right? Like, uh, applications are well built with web browser as the, uh, you know, As the client, and it makes your applications accessible to everybody. Ah, so it solves the distribution problem. So SAS transformation has been happening, but it is still slow, uh, to the point where, uh, I think administrators and decision makers think about, have to think about, you know, will I, will I get the same performance, right? Like if I move to a SAS application. And there are many deeply entrenched workflows which kind of slow down this, this transformation. While the transformation or kind of the exhalation to SAS applications is happening, right? Like a new era of applications is coming in. What does it look like? In this era, End users, customers will continue using native applications. They continue using SAS applications. You're not going to change them overnight, you know. Um, but there are 3 new patterns that are gonna emerge or are kind of already emerging. The first one is in-app agents. These agents live within the applications that are already being used, whether they are native applications or the SAS applications, right? Like, this can be an in-app agent on the sidebar, which has the context of how you're using the tool, you know, and helps accelerate the usage. The second one is agentic assistant on teammates. You heard some of the announcements in Matt's keynote about uh new frontier agents and teammates that AAS has launched. This is a different pattern of how agentic usage, you know, works or agents work alongside the end user as an assistant, or they have an independent identity of their own as a teammate. And the third one is born native Agentic applications. It's a completely new experience framework, you know, and uh together, I would say with these 3 new components, this is the agentic era of applications, right? So, Starting with native applications, transitioning to SAS applications, and then accelerating to agentic applications. I want to take a look at this era a little bit, or this new paradigm, a little bit in more detail to talk about, you know, what is that we should be thinking about, you know. Let's talk about experience frameworks, right? How, reflect on your typical workday, how do you do work, right? And you will see that your work is dominated by create, edit, edit, edit, edit loops. You edit a lot, you know. How is that gonna change? I believe these loops get changed from edit, edit, edit to create and review loops where the experience has to be optimized for shortening the time it takes for you to review and hand it back to agentic application for further iterating on the creation of that content. What does it really mean on how you shape the digital workplace? If you look at traditional operating systems, they were really optimized for the former, which is edit, edit, edit, you know, and the entire UI framework that the operating, the legacy operating systems built was to give you a familiar framework on the edit functionality across different UI applications. The, but the new experience frameworks are gonna focus on, if you see kind of the animation, what is that square box which the agents and the humans use to access these applications? Is it a traditional operating system-based desktop? I think newer patterns are going to emerge where the experience and the collection of those applications is influenced by shortening the review loops, not by the legacy UI framework of operating systems. While that transition happens, in-app agents are going to continue filling the gap, which is while you think about the adoption of bonogentic applications, these in-app agents continue helping you utilize the UIs that you're already invested in and still accelerate your work. So the first thing we talk about here is about the new experience frameworks. What is the future of work or a future digital workplace, how you should be thinking about the experience of that, you can actively shape it. It's not where the legacy UI framework of operating systems, new experience frameworks are going to emerge. And the acceleration to agentic applications, which I call the right shift, right, from native applications to SASS applications to agentic applications, we see very, very fast. Transition, right? Like you see like in-app agents, agentic applications, different modes of agentic usage, uh, you know, happening, and many of the organizations are actually completely skipping the SAS, uh, modernizations and skipping from native to agentic applications. I think that there are, there are two or three key points to make here on how this acceleration itself leverages agentic AI. Many of the times, organizations don't step into a modernization journey because they think that I have 20 million lines of code in my native application, right? Like, and it's gonna take me a decade to modernize it. I think a lot of that fear is fueled by lack of precise understanding of how your end users are using that application, right? Like, and we are gonna give deep visibility to you to understand the sweet spot, the 80/20, or, you know, what is the 20% of the feature set that 80% of your end users are using, and what are the features and capabilities that users don't care about, that you don't have to port, right? And You talked about AWS, uh, Matt talked about AWS Transform in his uh keynote that it enables 5 up to 5X pace of uh modernization of uh typical Windows applications, right? So with deep visibility into usage patterns and agentic applications like AWS Transform that understand your code base, you can really, really curate a strategy, and then you will see uh kind of more offerings and products from outside. So, all of this is good, but what does it what does it mean for boosted productivity of your end users? And that means today, what, what it can do for you today, right? Like it's like it's not a theoretical concept. You You heard Matt introduce Frontier agents, Kiiro Autonomous agent, AWS security agent, and AWS DevOps agents. Right? We call them frontier agents because they are, they're not typical agents. They have deep understanding. They are even beyond the research agents to kind of pick up the lexicon of uh uh agentic AI, you know. But what is next? What is the next in line of frontier agents that like, you know, AWS and Workspaces are gonna work, work on? An admin-focused agent that helps you pick the right flavor of the product, helps you onboard to the workspace's service, helps you manage the workload, helps you optimize the workload, both from a cost and performance perspective, and it's able to take actions on your behalf, right? Many of you have actually seen demos of it. If you had an ABC with us earlier this week, we have shown you demos of all these three capabilities, experience frameworks. boosted productivity, as well as kind of transformation journey, right. Um, so, if you haven't seen the demo, please ping your point of contact with the workspaces or end user computing services on AWS and we'll like, we'll love to get in touch with you, give you a sneak preview and take input from you. Continuing on this, you know, what is next in the line of frontier agents, right? Like we talk about computer use a lot. Computer use capabilities, they apply to SAS applications. But how do we really, really enable the thick applications to move fast and act like agentic applications as well, right? There's gonna be a new. There's going to be a new flavor of computer use which is built for thick applications, which enables these agents to work on your behalf as an assistant or as a teammate, you know, working on these remote thick applications and completely automating your business workflows. This is also one of the demos that is available to you, you know, so please ping us. So, new experience frameworks, accelerated right shift towards agentic applications, boosted productivity, you know, what does it really mean for the choices that you have to make? I believe there should at least be one pilot that you're running or need to run, which is pure, which is free from the legacy choices that you have made or you have had to make, you know, and, uh, working with your leaders, you should be looking to invest in this pure pilot and expanding it because I believe your leadership is also starting to believe in the kind of, you know, uh, the agentic AI and how it's gonna help, you know, make your organizations more nimble. I will end by saying that you can choose to retrofit your legacy choices 365 days of the year. Or you can choose to reinvent, you know, and we'll be with you every day of the week, every day of the year, working alongside with you. Thanks for your time. We appreciate you coming in and uh love chatting with all of you. We still have some time left in the hour. I think we can take some questions and I'll still be around along with the other speakers to, to have a conversation with you. Thank you.
