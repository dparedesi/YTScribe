summary: "This session, \"What you've been waiting for: Oracle Exadata in AWS data center (DAT210),\" announces the native availability of Oracle Exadata Database Service within AWS data centers. Presented by Kambiz Aghili from Oracle and Avinash from Equifax, the talk highlights a significant partnership where Oracle's high-performance Exadata hardware and full suite of database services (including Autonomous Database) are now physically co-located and integrated into AWS infrastructure. This \"Multi-Cloud\" approach offers zero-latency connectivity between Oracle databases and AWS applications, solving previous challenges of cross-cloud latency (e.g., between OCI and AWS). Key benefits include simplified management via AWS tools (Terraform, CloudFormation), native integration with AWS security services (KMS), and automated data protection. Avinash from Equifax shares a customer perspective, explaining how they are migrating their massive, high-throughput billing systems from RDS to Oracle Exadata on AWS to overcome storage limitations (64TB cap on RDS vs. petabytes on Exadata) and ensuring their data is \"AI-ready\" with Oracle 23ai features, all while keeping their applications seamlessly running on AWS."

Um, can you hear me OK? Perfect. All right, wonderful. So, uh, the agenda for this gonna speak for, I'm, I'm so privileged to have one of our valuable customers, Equifax, with me today to share their experiences as well on the multi-cloud, but I'm gonna spend like 7-8 minutes talking through some general, uh, overview, uh, topics and then hand it over to Avinash, and then we'll leave, try to leave 4 or 5 minutes if you have any questions to go through that. All right, my name is Kambi Zaggili. I'm vice president of product for CI, um, uh, in charge of Multi-Cloud, so thrilled to be here with you, um. A couple of things I wanted to talk about to establish what multi-cloud is. Oracle has been a best in class database relier database technology for the past 40 years. Any of the 8 or 9 out of 10 verticals customers within each vertical, you look at, they're utilizing Oracle one way or another. And Oracle has always been available on premises across different deployment models, and this is the first time that we're bringing the Oracle end to end the exadatta technology and an entire database services and all the surrounding elements of the Oracle technology natively available through AWS. Center, so Oracle is in all clouds, including now AWS and Azure and natively operating from data center operating from the exaatta hardware, and we'll talk about some of the things that are so unique about it as opposed to operating just on a commodity hardware. So we've been working really, really hard since last year to continue to innovate on behalf of the customers. If I were to classify three categories of innovations that we work really hard on, on the customer requirements to deliver, there are threefold. One is on simplifying the management and operations of the database. So customers now they have access to tools to automate. The database infrastructure has code. They can utilize APIs, cloud formation, as well as terraform, so it simplifies end to end of their journey. 2, now we do offer customers the full automated data protection in near real time, whereas they can utilize an autonomous recovery service that was never ever available through a third party cloud natively operating. On our hardware before, 3rd is security. We understood that it's really critical for customers to be able to not only use our Oracle technology in terms of a database and all the underlying services we offer, but also to be able to integrate very well with the AWS's best in class, also cloud and AI, as well as the operational services around us. So for instance, from a security perspective, now we offer as of last week. Integration with the AWS key management and this is really fantastic because customers who love to use KMS they are able to utilize that on Oracle operating natively on from the AWS Data Center like never before and on that on that angle they are also able to continue to use other services around security including Vault and Oracle Key Vault. So when you look at the multi-cloud, it's basically operating all the Oracle database services and services around it, operating on native Oracle hardware infrastructure from the AWS Data Center with the native interoperability of the Oracle technology alongside all the AWS services that customers would love to use. So there's a ton of integration that we have put in place in terms of. You want to use, you saw the prior presentation as well that you want to use AWS as bedrock. You want to use gentic applications. So this gives you the ability to combine the data from the Oracle Oracle workloads and Oracle Exit data and an autonomous AI database with the AWS services and AI capabilities natively integrated with one another. So when you're building a modernizing new application. that need to utilize AI or need to utilize the best breed of both technologies. This is for the first time it's available. And the third piece in addition to integration is just like making sure that we have federated or otherwise, having all these surrounding services around our operational governance and security and data protection to be also available natively and integrated with AWS. As the two key players there, they've never ever been done before, um. Exitata has been the best in class hardware technology for running database services. It's the unique technology that allows you. From an enterprise class set of workloads to have zero RTPO within region across multiple AZs as well as getting to near zero synchronous data guard and building active active configurations across the regions. So all of these are now available natively to AWS customers that would love to utilize both services across AWS regions that are operating Oracle workloads. Again, it's a full end to end feature parity, performance parity MAA architecture of the Oracle that technology customers have used for 30, 40 years available natively to them from AWS on their Oracle database at AWS specifically, not to confuse with the other services that are operating on the commodity hardware and AWS, but complements them for the most part. We have low latency networks built out into the configuration whereas customers who were running applications and the database tiers independently of one another, separately from one another, these are now operating from the same data center with a microsecond latency in between. So as you're thinking about agentic AI applications, modernizing your applications or building new configurations over time, that latency plays a very, very unique play into the horizon going forward. Seamless experience. Customers will have the same experience going to the AWS marketplace as they do with any of the other first class AWS services. They can utilize the AWSPA and all the other capabilities and financial means available to them to procure and pay for Oracle services operating natively from AWS. And then, as I indicated. Connecting these services to one another is built in natively into what we have offered. So I'm going to stop there, you know, for a second, um, hand over to Avinash from Equifax to share their experience. One thing I wanted to share is that we launched last year GA, so this is an enterprise class service with hundreds and hundreds of customers already on it. We are available in the US, East, West, 2 AZs, multiple AZs each. We are launching 3 more regions with multiple AZs at the end of this month where 20 more regions are aligned with the, um, in the next 9 to 10 months to go live and GA accordingly. So this is a service going to be available in and around the world, everywhere. Customs need it. Avinaj, take it over. Thank you. Hello everybody, uh, are you able to hear me? Cool. So um. I will talk a little bit about Equifax. I think, uh, most of the people uh in US at least that are using Equifax as one of the major credit bureau. We are not just a credit bureau company, we are a data company. We have all the consumer data and all. So, uh, why Equifax basically? So I mean, it's a very loaded slide. I cannot go everything based on the given time I have. So I will just talk a little bit about how Equifax is using AI and then AWS and all other cloud provided services. So Equifax built its. own cloud internally. We call it data fabric layer, and we harness all the data of the consumer and provide the insights of the data to the consumer for their benefits. So we are mainly providing three major services like employer workforce solutions, US information systems solutions, which is like mortgage services and all. If you go for any mortgage and all that, any bank or any lenders, they use our Equifax services for all the verifications. Employment verification. If you join any company and you know a a company needs to do the verification and all, they use our services. So Equifax has a lot of services. These are the major services which most of the people are aware of. So I was just talking about that. So how that all the data that Equifax use and provide that by maintaining that Equifax cloud. So we have that internal Equifax own design for our cloud. Uh, stuff to provide the real-time insight multi-data asset at scale, improve the speed and performance because when that you need or any B2B, uh, our customer need any data, their performance and speed is very important, right? So there are a lot of talk. I mean, uh, you guys can have that access through the slide. You can read through that any question always ready to answer further. So we are using an autonomous database at AWS because we have that. So I support basically all the enterprise data and financial systems. So financial systems consist of the billing system, which is very highly OTP database we need. So currently we are having like billions of users' records come to our system and then we have to process. We have the three major billing cycles before. Billing cycle we have to rate all the data. We have to build the data, create the billing data, create the invoice, and ship the invoice. So it's a very, very always time constraint related, right? We need a very high performance system to perform that, otherwise we have a revenue loss. If we don't ship the invoices on time, then we will have a revenue loss. And also that the data that we cannot immediately remove the data from the system. So we need a high storage data. So, I mean, like, uh uh this is like a high-level architecture that how the data comes to the system and how we process and all that. Certain points are there that high volume uses processing, dynamic order management and all that. Um, So what are the major key benefits that we are getting using ADB? So currently we are using RDS RDS Oracle, definitely a very good service. We have been using since 7 years RDS for BRM system. Over the 7 year period of time that our database has grown like anything, so we are at the verge of around 64 terabytes. The good news that yesterday it was announced that we are having the 256 terabyte version of RDS. But the, uh, the reason of moving to ADB is basically it is sitting in AWS using all the infrastructure of ADB. Uh, ODB, which is sitting in AWS. So, uh, as, as Cambridge mentioned that, I mean, like it is Aa data is sitting on the AWS data center. So, my all the applications are sitting in the AWS. So it's a seamless, no latency, no issues. Even if we want to use that exa data service in OCI, we will have to deal with the latency between AWS and OCI. So this is like kind of a best of both worlds. So I mean like major is optimized performance and throughput. If you see that we are like a very highly OLTP systems, we have to, as I mentioned that we have to do the usage on time, create the billing and invoices, and ship the invoices. So we need a very, very high performance system which underline extra data is definitely going to help us. Uh, scalable storage and data visibility. So I mean like Ex data provides that petabytes of storage, so we don't have to worry about storage constraint, which other database services we have. For an example, that currently that to manage RDS we are having 64 terabyte limitation. So we have to every quarter pass the data and then archive the data or whatever we are purging because it's the billing data. We cannot just purge it. So we have to maintain a lot of archives because of that process and limitation. So with the extra data and the petabytes of storage capacity, we don't need to worry about. And also when our data grows in size, exact data performance will help to navigate that data. If any other service we are taking for Oracle databases to run like on-prem or whatever, we have to do a lot of maintenance activities for that. So that is, that is one of the best benefits we are getting using this service. Uh, as I mentioned that, I mean, it's a unified cloud workload because uh it is sitting with AWS. We have a lot of AWS services we are using. So it is seamless integration is, is, is another key benefit we are using through ADB. We also have one important part is that 23 AI and 26 AI Oracle AI that 26AI was announced. So by moving to this, that we are making our data AI ready. So application has been constrained because we are using Oracle billing system, which is CO's product. It may lag on their roadmap for AI enablement, but what we could do by moving to ADB, we are making our data AI ready. So we can have our own AI solution on sitting on ADB using AX and all that which is available as part of ADB. So these are the major benefits uh due to time constant. uh I will just pass it to Canvas. Yeah, yeah, sure. Thank you, I mean I really appreciate it. All right, so there are a bunch of places you can go to learn more. Just simply search for Oracle Multi-Cloud, search for MultiCloud on Google. Some of the links here that I'm sure you can't remember, but the video recording will be available on the AWS website in a couple of weeks, and I wanted to dedicate between Avinash and I 456 minutes for any questions you might have. So there's a microphone out there if you have questions. We are here at your disposal. I should have taken more time. All right, give you back the 2 minutes. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. Thanks for being here. Bye. Thank you, Cari. Thank you.
